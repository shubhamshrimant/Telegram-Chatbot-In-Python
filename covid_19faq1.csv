questions,answers
"What is COVID-19?","COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions."
"What is coronavirus?","Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illness in humans and animals. Seven different types have been found in people, including those responsible for the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 epidemics."
How does COVID-19 spread?,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person   to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with   COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.   Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their   eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person   with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than   1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick."
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients   may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These   symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t   develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the   disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19   becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying   medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to   develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical   attention."
How do I know if it is COVID-19 or just the common flu?,"A COVID-19 infection has the same signs and symptoms as the common cold and you can only   differentiate them through laboratory testing to determine the virus type. If you have fever, cough   and difficulty breathing, you should seek medical attention and immediately isolate yourself from   others. Call your local UN clinic/medical facility to inform them of your condition and relevant   travel/exposure history. If you had been identified as a close contact of a case by the local   Ministry of Health or WHO, please also indicate this. From here you will be advised if a medical   assessment is necessary and how to get tested."
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?,Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through   contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. See previous answer on “How   does COVID-19 spread?”
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?,"Protection measures for everyone   Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website   and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world   have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some   other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is   unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions: •   Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them     with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based     hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. •   Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or     sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes, they spray small liquid droplets from     their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the     droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. •   Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up     viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From     there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. •   Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means     covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.     Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following     good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu     and COVID-19. •   Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek     medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.     Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the     situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly     direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of     viruses and other infections. •   Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is     spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older     person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching     COVID-19 in one of these areas."
I am well and asymptomatic. Should I use a mask?,"According to the WHO, for individuals without respiratory symptoms, a medical mask is not required, as no evidence is available on its usefulness to protect non-sick persons. However, masks might be worn in some countries according to local cultural habits. If masks are used, best practices should be followed on how to wear, remove, and dispose of them and on hand hygiene action after removal. For more information, visit the WHO guidance on use of masks in the community."
How likely am I to catch COVID-19?,"The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19. COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide. You can see these at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus- 2019/situation-reports/"
Are pregnant women more susceptible to the COVID-19 virus and will it harm the       fetus?,"We do not have information from published scientific reports about the susceptibility of pregnant women to COVID-19. Pregnant women experience immunologic and physiologic changes, which might make them more susceptible to viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly by close contact with an infected person through respiratory droplets. Whether a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can transmit the virus that causes COVID-19 to her fetus or neonate by other routes of vertical transmission (before, during, or after delivery) is still unknown."
What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?,"Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. You can learn more about who is most at risk for health problems if they have COVID-19 infection on CDC’s current Risk Assessment page."
Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than in adults?,"No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. It’s not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children."
Should I worry about COVID-19?,"Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost, among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings."
Who is at risk of developing severe illness?,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others."
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others."
Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?,"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines."
"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?","Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. (See Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus)."
Should I wear a mask to protect myself from catching the COVID-19 virus?,"Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely. WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks (see Advice on the use of masks). The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more information."
Until when should I wear a mask after recovering from an illness with respiratory       symptoms?,"In order to avoid infecting others, you should use a mask for as long as you are still coughing or sneezing. You should only stop after a complete recovery (which means 24-48 hours after having no symptoms without medication)."
I am looking after someone who is ill with suspect or confirmed COVID-19. What       precautions should I take?,"•   You should limit the movement around the house of the individual who is ill and           minimize shared space.       •   Ensure shared spaces like bathrooms, and the kitchen are well ventilated. One way to           do this is by keeping the windows open. Clean and disinfect the bathroom and toilet           surface at least once a day using regular household soap or detergent for cleaning and           then disinfecting with a regular household disinfectant containing 0.5% sodium           hypochlorite.       •   Do not forget the importance of hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand-rub or soap and           water (if hands are visibly soiled).       •   Whenever possible, household members should stay in a different room or maintain a           distance of at least 1 meter from the ill person.       •   When helping care for the sick individual, wear a tightly fitted medical/surgical mask           that covers your nose and mouth when in the same room as the affected individual.           Make sure you are careful not to touch your mask. If your mask gets wet or dirty, it           should be replaced. When removing a mask, it is important to throw it away and           perform hand hygiene. Dispose of any material with respiratory secretions immediately           after use.       •   Both the ill individual and you, as the caregiver, should perform hand hygiene after           contact with respiratory secretions."
How long is the incubation and transmission period for COVID-19?,"The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1- 14 days, most commonly around five days."
Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,"Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed. To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose."
How can I get tested for COVID-19?,"If you are well, no testing is recommended. If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, you should immediately isolate yourself from others. Call your local UN clinic/medical facility to inform them of your condition and relevant travel/exposure history. If you had been identified as a close contact of a case by the local Ministry of Health or WHO, please also indicate this. From here you will be advised if a medical assessment is necessary and how to get tested."
What alternatives do I have if there are no hand sanitizers available?,"Can I use other       alcohol like ethyl or liquor? If hand sanitizers are not available, hand washing with soap and water is the recommended, and even better, alternative. Liquor is not effective against coronavirus. For an alcohol-based hand rub to be effective, it must have an alcohol content of 60% to 95%."
Can people who recover from COVID-19 be infected again?,"We know that for similar coronaviruses, infected people are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover. However, because the immune response to COVID-19 is not yet understood, it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients who have recovered from COVID-19."
Is it safe to receive a package from an area where COVID-19 has been reported?,"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low."
Is there a connection between COVID -19 and environment temperature?,"It is not known yet if weather and temperature changes impact or has any connection with COVID-19. At this time, it is not clear or known if the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when the weather becomes warmer."
"Can I catch the virus from being in an enclosed space (i.e. bus, subway) in close       proximity to someone who doesn’t have respiratory symptoms?","Since the virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets, the risk of catching it from somebody who is asymptomatic, even a contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case, is low. However, in light of the pandemic, everyone should maintain social distancing, which means keeping at least 1 meter away from others, avoiding mass gatherings and areas with large numbers of people, and practicing frequent hand washing and hand sanitizing according to the recommendation."
Should I start avoiding people of Asian descent and their businesses?,"The virus can affect anyone regardless of nationality, race and color. The Organization will not tolerate discrimination and encourages everyone to promote culturally appropriate and empathetic community engagement and to detect and rapidly respond to negative public perceptions and counter misinformation."
When should we identify ourselves as ""being sick"" and stay at home?","Although a fever is a sure sign that you are sick enough not to come to work, anyone experiencing respiratory symptoms like coughing and sneezing should stay at home."
My colleague is sick but he/she insists that it is just the common cold and is reluctant      to work from home. What steps can we take to enforce “staying at home when not      well” amongst staff?,"While it is very likely that your colleague is only suffering from the common cold or flu, all precautions should, nevertheless, be taken. Managers should encourage staff members with flu symptoms to telecommute for some time until the symptoms have abated. Alternatively, if the staff member is feeling unfit, he/she should take sick leave. This is a sensible approach at any time to prevent the spreading of flu or other seasonal viruses. Supervisors are also encouraged to exercise flexibility in terms of using remote working arrangements if the staff member would like to limit their contact with others and work from home."
What can we do if we don’t have any hand sanitizers in the office building?,"You should contact the Facilities Management Service of your local UN duty station, organization or the building administration."
What is the process for evaluating the criticality of official travels and meetings?,UN Medical Directors recommend that UN managers and/or UN personnel undertake a risk assessment to evaluate the criticality of the proposed travel balanced against the risks to the traveler for any travel to or meetings in affected areas experiencing ongoing transmission of COVID-19.
Does the UN have any specific guidelines for meeting / mass gathering organizers and      participants during the COVID-19 outbreak?,"•    For meetings during the COVID-19 outbreak, the Division of Healthcare Management and      Occupational Safety and Health (DHMOSH) has prepared the following guidelines for      meeting organizers and participants which are available in the UN HR portal. UN offices      should use these global guidelines to develop local ones in accordance with host country      legislation. •    The WHO has also released an interim guidance with key planning recommendations for      mass gatherings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak."
I plan to travel to / have a meeting in countries or territories currently experiencing      local transmission of COVID-19. Should I cancel this travel/meeting?,"•    While the WHO does not recommend and advises against the application of any travel      restrictions based on the information currently available on COVID-19, as an occupational      health measure, it is recommended that for all official travel, UN managers and/or UN      personnel undertake a risk assessment to evaluate the criticality of the proposed travel      balanced against the risks to the traveler for any travel to or meetings in affected areas      experiencing ongoing transmission of COVID-19. This includes risks posed by both medical      issues and evolving travel/border restrictions enacted by states parties. •   Please be aware that local authorities may begin to implement travel restrictions and health     screening measures for travelers entering or exiting the country. All UN personnel who are     planning to travel should check with the destination countries’ embassy, consulate, or     Ministry of Health and keep up to date with local health advice before and during your     travel. You should also comply with any screening measures put in place by local authorities. •   As the outbreak evolves, it can be difficult to predict the situation globally, and it would be     prudent to make contingency arrangements should the need arise. Feel free to consult us     further at dos-dhmosh-public-health@un.org as needed."
"What is the protocol for staff members returning to work after visiting COVID-19     affected countries (i.e., those with ongoing transmission)?","•   If you have just returned from an affected area, you should self-monitor for symptoms for     14 days after travel. •   During that period, you should immediately seek medical attention should you develop any     signs and symptoms, such as shortness of breath or cough. •   Remember to share your previous travel history with your health care provider and make     every effort to inform them by phone prior to visiting a medical facility and wear a medical     mask when you seek medical care. •   You should only return to work when you are well and completely free of symptoms. •   HR personnel and managers are encouraged to exercise flexibility around remote working to     support staff."
I just returned from travel to a country/area experiencing local transmission of     COVID-19. I am well and have no symptoms. Can I go back to the workplace?,"•   For any UN personnel who are free of symptoms, and returning from country/area or     territory experiencing local transmission of COVID-19, managers are encouraged to exercise     flexibility in terms of using remote working arrangements for staff in these situations who     would like to limit their contact with others and work from home for 14 days post-travel.     This is not mandatory but is strongly encouraged. •   Individuals returning from areas of outbreaks should be advised to review our health     advisory on this Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) page so that you have awareness about the     disease. You should monitor yourself daily for signs of fever, respiratory symptoms (e.g.,     breathing difficulties, cough), and know where to seek medical attention if you are aware of     any symptoms within yourself. You should monitor yourself for at least 14 days after your     travel."
What about self-quarantining after returning from an area/country of high     prevalence?,"•   If you have just returned from an affected area, you should self-monitor for symptoms for     14 days after travel. During that period, you should immediately seek medical attention     should you develop any signs and symptoms, such as shortness of breath or cough. •   Self-quarantine for 14 days is recommended when you have been exposed to contact with     lab-confirmed COVID-19. •   Since this is a rapidly evolving situation, many member states are imposing quarantine     recommendations for travelers, which varies by country. We suggest monitoring the travel     advisories issued from WHO and DHMOSH for up to date information     https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/travel-advice and     https://hr.un.org/page/travel-health-information"
Have medical insurance related questions?,Please refer to Frequently Asked Questions for UN staff on Medical Insurance in connection with the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2020- 03-09_faq_medical_insurance_covid-19_ra.pdf
What are the latest protocols and guidance for Medical Evacuation of staff members     with severe respiratory infections related to COVID-19?,"•    For the latest information on normal Medevac procedure for staff, go to:          https://hr.un.org/sites/hr.un.org/files/Coronavirus_MedevacGuidance_UN_RC_0.pdf     •    For information on special Medevac procedure organized by the WHO in cases where          there are no ICU beds available in your country, see:          https://hr.un.org/sites/hr.un.org/files/COVID-          MEDEVAC%20UN%20and%20PARTNERS.pdf"
"what if i am having difficulty in breathing","Stay home and self-isolate even if you have minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Call your health care provider or hotline for advice. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house or have someone near you, wear a medical mask to avoid infecting others."
What are the symptoms?,"Symptoms include fever, coughing, sore throat, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
However, be aware that at this stage if you have a cough or a cold, it's likely that you just have a cough or a cold and not coronavirus.
If you have serious symptoms such as difficulty breathing, call 000 for urgent medical help.
If you get these symptoms above after being in contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, seek medical attention.
The same goes if you develop symptoms within 14 days of returning home to Australia after being overseas."
When should I get tested?,Your doctor will tell you if you need to get tested.
What's the difference between physical distancing and self-isolation?,"As cases of coronavirus surge, health authorities are advising Australians to practise physical distancing (also called social distancing) as much as possible to limit transmission. Physical distancing is what everyone can do - like staying home - regardless of whether or not they've been exposed to coronavirus.
Self-isolating or self-quarantining is a more strict and onerous kind of physical distancing - it means cutting yourself off from the outside world.All passengers who arrive in Australia are going into mandatory quarantine in hotels for a fortnight.
Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland, Northern Territory and Tasmania have also essentially closed their borders - any arrivals are required to self-isolate for 14 days."
How do I practice physical distancing?,"If you have been in contact with a person with a COVID-19 infection while they were ill, you need to isolate yourself for 14 days after you last saw that person.
In general, stay home as much as you can.
If you have to go out, from midnight Monday, March 30, you cannot see more than one other person. This applies to both private and public gatherings and indoor and outdoor spaces.
For example, if you go to the park, you can only go with one person.
The restrictions do not apply within your household - if you live in a sharehouse of four, you can still see your housemates.
You're also allowed to visit family members in other houses, including your partner.
Announcing this restriction, the Prime Minister said acceptable reasons to leave the house include:Shopping for what you needFor medical care or compassionate needs (e.g. caring for someone else)To exercise (provided no more than two people in a group)For work and education (if you cannot work or learn remotely)
The general aim of physical distancing rules is to avoid situations where you may come in close contact with others (face-to-face contact closer than one metre for more than 15 minutes or being in the same closed space for two hours).
Avoid shaking hands, crowds of people, and busy indoor and outdoor spaces."
What's closed?,"Physical distancing is the reason the Federal Government has closed pubs, indoor sporting venues and churches across Australia.
The situation with schools varies state by state. Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and Northern Territory will keep schools open for the children of essential workers but will began to implement pupil-free days in the coming weeks. Victoria and ACT schools are already on break. NSW schools remain open but students are encouraged to stay at home.
The Prime Minister has said all ""non-essential"" travel within Australia should be cancelled. Western Australia and South Australia have closed their borders - any arrivals after Tuesday afternoon, March 24, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days.
The goal of these social distancing measures is to avoid a worst-case scenario that would see four million Australians contract COVID-19 in a single wave.
Slowing the spread may prevent health services from being overwhelmed by coronavirus cases.
From midnight on Wednesday, March 25, these activities and businesses will no longer be allowed to continue:
Amusement parks and arcadesIndoor and outdoor play centresCommunity and recreation centres, health clubs, fitness centres, yoga, barre, spin facilities, saunas, wellness centresPublic swimming poolsGalleries, museums, national institutions, historic sites, libraries, community centresAuction housesReal estate auctions and open house inspectionsIn-store beauty therapy, tanning, waxing, nail salons and tattoo parlours, spa and massage parlours (excluding allied-health-related services, like physiotherapy)Food courts within shopping centres will only be able to sell takeaway. Shopping centres themselves will remain openHairdressers and barber shops can continue, but a customer must not be on the premises longer than one hourPersonal training and boot camps are limited to a maximum of 10 peopleWeddings can continue, but only with the couple, the celebrant, and witnesses totalling a maximum of five peopleFunerals are limited to a maximum of 10 peopleOutdoor and indoor food markets will be addressed by individual states and territories"
What are the rules of self-isolation?,"Remember, the vast majority of Australians aren't being told to self-isolate. It only applies to those who have recently come back from overseas, (before midnight on March 28 - after then its forced quarantine), or if you've been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.
But if you are one of those people who has to self-isolate, it means that you need to stay away from all situations where you could infect other people. This means any situation where you may come in close contact with others (face-to-face contact closer than one metre for more than 15 minutes or being in the same closed space for two hours).
You should avoid social gatherings, work, school, child care, university, sports gatherings, restaurants, and all other public gatherings.
You should try not to leave the house. If your outside areas are a shared space in a building or apartment block, it's best to wear a surgical mask while out there.
Stay in your room and clean lots.

"
How do I self-isolate in a sharehouse?,"If you're living with people who are not in isolation, wear a mask when you're in the same room as them. It's best to sleep in a different room to your partner, avoid spending time in communal areas and use a separate bathroom, if possible.
Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds before entering areas used by others and after using the bathroom."
Should I avoid domestic travel?,"The Prime Minister has also said all ""non-essential"" travel within Australia should be cancelled. Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland, Northern Territory and Tasmania have essentially closed their borders - any arrivals are required to self-isolate for 14 days."
Should I avoid big gatherings like parties or weddings?,"Yes. Avoid big gatherings.
Weddings can continue, but only with the couple, the celebrant, and witnesses totalling a maximum of five people. Funerals are limited to a maximum of 10 people
In addition to this, pubs, clubs, restaurants and churches have also been forced to close."
Will I get paid if I can't work?,"This may depend on whether you're permanent or casual.
Usually, if you are asked by your employer not to work (assuming you're a full-time or part-time employee), you would be entitled to be paid.
However, that typically applies to natural disasters, and not a pandemic like COVID-19.
Experts say that, unless there's a special clause in your Enterprise Agreement, employers may be able to stand employees down without pay.
This will vary with each employer, so it's best to check with them.
For casual workers and independent contractors, including gig economy workers, the situation is potentially more grim.
According to Fair Work, if you're a casual employee needing to look after a family member who is sick with coronavirus, or suffering an unexpected emergency, you are entitled to just two days of unpaid carer's leave per occasion.
After that, you'll need to contact your employer to work out an arrangement.
Casual employees and independent contractors may qualify for the sickness allowance, a means-tested payment that provides up to $560 for singles without children and $1,010 for couples out of work due to illness.
The Government has waived the one-week waiting period to access the allowance.
The Federal Government has increased existing payments for welfare allowances, and expanding eligibility criteria for new applicants, for six months to late September.
You can apply for this without going into Centrelink. More information here."
Can I get welfare?,Yes. 
Do I still have to pay rent?,"Welfare bodies want a ban on housing evictions for the next few months to support people who have lost their income because of the coronavirus outbreak.
So far, however, that's not happening.
The WA Government has frozen all 'household fees and charges' - this doesn't include rent. It will mean electricity, water, motor vehicle charges, the emergency services levy and public transport fares in the state will not increase until at least July 2021.

Can you catch coronavirus twice?,"A definitive answer is not yet known, but experts say reinfection seems unlikely."
Are there any extra risks for pregnant women or their developing babies?,"The peak body for obstetrics and gynaecology and women's health, RANZCOG, has advice and information about COVID-19.
At this time, pregnant women do not appear to be more severely unwell if they develop COVID-19 infection than the general populationThere is no evidence to suggest an increased risk of miscarriageThere is no evidence to suggest the virus can pass to your developing babyThere is no evidence the virus is carried in breastmilk"
Are schools and unis closed? Will they close?,"Other countries have closed schools and universities as a social distancing measure, however Australia has not yet taken this step.
The situation with schools varies state by state. Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and Northern Territory will keep schools open for the children of essential workers but will began to implement pupil-free days in the coming weeks. Victoria and ACT schools are already on break. NSW schools remain open but students are encouraged to stay at home.
Several schools around the country have closed temporarily after a staff member or student tested positive for the virus.
Some universities have chosen to close their campuses."
How far away is a cure or vaccine?,"About 35 companies and academic institutions are racing to create such a vaccine, at least four of which already have candidates they have been testing in animals.
The first of these has begun testing in Seattle.
However, even if the trials prove the experimental vaccine is safe and effective, it will still be many months before it can be mass-produced and distributed."
What are the symptoms?,"Novel coronavirus can cause symptoms that range from mild to severe, including cough, fever and shortness of breath. Since the symptoms are similar to those of pneumonia, influenza and the common cold, only a diagnostic test can confirm whether an individual has coronavirus."
How is it transmitted?,"The first cases of COVID-19 were believed to be linked to a live-animal market in China, but the virus has since been spreading from person to person.

Person-to-person transmission is most likely between people in close contact, about 6 feet. When a person infected with novel coronavirus sneezes or coughs, respiratory droplets could land on people nearby or could possibly be inhaled by those people.

While the virus can be transmitted by touching objects or surfaces contaminated with COVID-19, health experts don't currently believe that's primarily how it's transmitted."
I live in the United States. What should I do?,"While specific guidelines vary from city to city, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised that Americans practice social distancing, and stay home, avoid mass gatherings and maintain 6 feet between themselves and others whenever possible. These efforts are intended to help ""flatten the curve,"" which means distributing the number of coronavirus cases over a longer period of time, to avoid overwhelming the health care system.

Americans should continue to uphold proper flu season hygiene. Wash your hands often, stay home if you're sick and cough or sneeze into your elbow rather than your hand.

If schools in your district have not yet closed, Dr. William Schaffner, medical director for the nonprofit National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, suggested sitting down and outlining a plan for how your family might handle schools and businesses closing. Does an older relative take prescription medication? Now might be a good time to stockpile at least two weeks' worth.

Call schools and ask if there are plans for remote schooling -- as some schools have done. Figure out a childcare plan in the event schools close, and ask about remote working options. Asking more questions now hopefully means asking fewer later."
Should I wear a face mask?,"Not unless you are the one who is sick.

The CDC doesn’t currently recommend any healthy person wear a mask and doctors warn fiddling with putting on and taking off a mask could backfire by exposing your hands to your face.

""Surgical masks fit rather loosely around the face and are not constructed, nor thick enough, to prevent infection,"" Schaffner said.

While they could have a modest benefit, any protection they provide is likely more psychological than scientific. N-95 masks, which hospitals use, are expensive and aren't easy to wear, meaning they're not a practical option for everyday use. As health officials have noted, masks should be reserved for the health care workers, not the general public.

In recent weeks, N-95 masks have grown so scarce that the White House is asking Americans who have them, as well as construction companies, to donate them to hospitals, so that health care workers aren't forced to treat COVID-19 patients without a mask, which puts them at risk for contracting the virus themselves.

""The other thing a mask can do is give you a false sense of security, and that's not helpful,"" said Dr. Michael Merson, a visiting professor at NYU's School of Global Public Health and a professor at Duke University. Masks work better at preventing people who are coughing and sneezing from spreading respiratory droplets and infecting others, but ""those people who are sick should probably be at home anyway.""

"
Should I be tested for the virus?,"It's not completely up to you.

The CDC recently rolled out new guidance, allowing anyone to be tested for COVID-19 without restrictions, as long as their doctor approves. Testing is on the rise in the U.S., but experts say it is not yet enough.

If you have traveled to an area with local transmission or have been in close contact with someone who has been exposed to the virus, and develop symptoms, such as cough or fever, your health care provider can work with the local health department to determine whether you should be tested for COVID-19.

If you have symptoms, but no travel history to an outbreak area, you could go to a clinic and have a rapid test done to rule out more common viruses, such as influenza, Merson advised.

If you have mild symptoms and are worried that you might have COVID-19, call your doctor or local health department instead of going to a clinic or doctor's office without an appointment, to ensure you aren't potentially exposing others to the virus. If you have severe breathing problems, seek medical attention or call 911 immediately, recommends Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News’ chief medical correspondent.

You should let the person you speak with know that you have respiratory problems and need to be isolated and seen right away."
Should I cancel my upcoming trip to Europe or Asia?,"The decision may be out of your hands.

The U.S. State Department has a Level 4 global health advisory in place, which says that Americans should avoid all international travel because of COVID-19.

""In countries where commercial departure options remain available, U.S. citizens who live in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period,"" the advisory reads.

The situation is fluid and rapidly evolving, so you should check the State Department's website often and use that information to inform your decisions.

Many countries experiencing outbreaks are implementing travel restrictions, mandatory quarantines and border closures with little advanced notice, and some Americans traveling in those countries have found themselves stranded, without a way to get home. 

If you are in a high-risk group, meaning you are an older person, or have an underlying medical condition, ""you should now be thinking about social distancing,"" Schaffner advised.

""Part of that is thinking really hard about whether you need to get on an airplane,"" he said. ""I think this is a good time to postpone those trips.""

Even if your trip is to a low-risk area, traveling on a plane will mean being in an enclosed space with fellow travelers. The CDC now recommends that all travelers, especially those with underlying health conditions, avoid cruise ships."
Do quarantines work?,"""The short answer is apparently, yes, and better than we thought,"" Schaffner said.

After China imposed strict quarantine and lockdown measures in hard-hit Hubei province, new cases of COVID-19 appeared to decline, Schaffner explained.

MORE: What life is like under novel coronavirus quarantine
It's too soon to know the full effect of that quarantine, which is essentially an unprecedented public health experiment. And imposing strict quarantine measures on an entire community may not be replicable outside of China.

Italy has locked down its entire population of 60 million, a dramatic move to try to tamp down on a rising number of cases and deaths."
Is the outbreak a pandemic?,"Yes.

The World Health organization defines a pandemic as ""the worldwide spread of a new disease,"" and on March 11, the WHO's director general announced that COVID-19 met those criteria.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general, stressed that the designation doesn't mean that citizens should stop trying to contain the virus.

""Find, isolate, test and treat every case, and trace every contact,"" he said. ""Ready your hospitals. Protect and train your health care workers.""

For the United States, community transmission in several cities and a growing number of cases that aren't able to be traced to travel or contact with individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 makes it probable that there will be extensive spread here.

""A lot of us have been sitting back and watching this from a distant place,"" Schaffner noted, adding that the game has changed in recent days. He cautioned against ""running around like a chicken with its head cut off,"" and recommended thinking ahead. A large increase in cases in your community could mean school closures or other changes to your routine.

""Be prudent and be prepared to participate as much as you can in social distancing when that becomes the order of the day,"" he said. If health authorities advise against mass gatherings, for example, don't make a fuss.

""It shouldn't panic you,"" Schaffner said. ""But it should get your attention."""
How concerned should I be -- how does COVID-19 compare to the flu?,"Concerned.

Stay on top of CDC updates and guidance, as well as from state and local health departments. Take the time to sit down and plan for what you'll do if local transmission of the virus occurs in your city.

Even the experts aren't completely sure what's going to happen.

""It's hard,"" said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, who described receiving a text message from his son asking whether he should stock up on canned goods.

""I would be inclined not to,"" Perlman said. ""We know from other cases that it actually tends to make things worse, because people stock up and then we don't have anything.""

COVID-19 appears to be more fatal than the flu, with some studies pegging COVID-19's fatality rate at around 3.4%, while the flu's fatality rate is less than 1%. Still, experts anticipate that COVID-19's mortality rate will fall when more people with mild symptoms are diagnosed with the virus. Typically, the sickest people tend to seek health care treatment first. Compared to past coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, however, most COVID-19 cases are mild.

""For most people, it's going to mean no disease or a mild illness,"" Merson said. Unfortunately, that mildness could also explain why COVID-19 is spreading more rapidly than highly fatal diseases do. HIV, for example, ""was very fatal, but hard to transmit,"" he added."
Can kids get coronavirus?,"Yes, but kids rarely have severe symptoms.

Reports from China include children who have contracted COVID-19, but those children typically had very mild symptoms and the majority of cases were diagnosed in adults. Severe complications from coronavirus, like acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock, are rare among kids. Similar to adults, children with underlying health problems may be at increased risk risk for complications associated with COVID-19.
"
Are pregnant women at higher risk?,"We don't know.

Because COVID-19 is a new virus, we don't know whether pregnant women are more susceptible than the general population. Based on data from previous coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS, some experts believe that pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe illness and death, but that data is limited and far from conclusive.

For now, neither the CDC nor the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend any specific guidance for pregnant women beyond what they recommend to the general public."
Is there a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19?,"No. There are trials underway in China and elsewhere, but because the virus is new, there's no approved treatment for COVID-19 and a vaccine is likely more than a year away."
Can I exercise outside? What about going to the park?,"Yes, but don't forget about social distancing.

Regular exercise can help keep you physically and mentally healthy during the outbreak. You should feel free to talk a walk, go to the park and get outside, but maintain at least 6 feet between yourself and others during that time. Don't pack into a crowded park, beach or hiking trail. Instead, head to an area with fewer people or exercise at off-hours, when not as many people are out and about.

Since COVID-19 can live on hard surfaces, and most playgrounds aren't cleaned and disinfected regularly, you may want to reconsider bringing your child there, especially if you live in an area with ongoing coronavirus transmissions. If you do decide to go to the playground, make sure your child stays at least 6 feet away from other children."
How did coronavirus start?,"The first case of coronavirus was detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan on December 12, 2019.

The virus is first thought to have originated from the city's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market."
How do you catch coronavirus?,"Coronavirus is thought to be spread by small drops of moisture we release when we sneeze or cough.

The moisture has to get into your body to make you sick, which means you can catch coronavirus if those droplets get into your eyes, nose or mouth."
How do I know if I have coronavirus?,"The most common symptoms of coronavirus are fever, sore throat, dry cough and fatigue. Other symptoms can also include headaches, nasal congestion or a runny nose.

Diarrhea and nausea have also been reported as symptoms but they are less common."
How is coronavirus tested?,"The COVID-19 test can be ordered by a specialist coronavirus clinic, your local GP or a hospital emergency department.

The Federal Government has announced plans to create up to 100 coronavirus pop-up clinics across the country.

But these testing facilities vary state by state, so it's best to first be in touch with the coronavirus health information hotline on 1800 020 080 for advice.

Testing methods may include a blood test, a swab test inside your nose or in the back of your throat, or a sputum test, which examines a mix of saliva and mucus.

Remember, you may still need a GP referral before attending new clinics, so be sure to check first."
How do you get tested for coronavirus?,"To get tested for coronavirus, you should first contact your general practitioner (GP) and warn them of your symptoms before arriving at the practice.

Your GP or hospital emergency department can order the test kits and, once completed, they are processed in public health laboratories across Australia."
How long can coronavirus survive on a surface?,"A study of previous coronaviruses found human coronaviruses could theoretically last on surfaces at room temperature for up to nine days.

That length of time could depend on:

The type of surface, because viruses survive on shiny, hard surfaces longer than soft ones;
Whether it is exposed to sunlight, because UV radiation kills viruses; and
Temperature and humidity, because viruses last longer at lower temperatures and lower humidity."
How can I prevent myself getting coronavirus?,"The best way to avoid catching coronavirus from touching a contaminated surface is to wash your hands properly and avoid touching your face.

You should also wash your hands:

After you use the bathroom;
After you cough or sneeze;
After taking public transport;
Before eating and preparing food;
After touching animals;
When caring for someone who is sick"
Who is most at risk of catching coronavirus?,"People over 65 are at higher risk of more severe symptoms, as are those with pre-existing conditions like heart disease or asthma.

Unlike during the influenza outbreak in 2009, pregnant women do not seem to be at greater risk of contracting coronavirus."
Is coronavirus worse than the flu?,"Many people diagnosed with the coronavirus will feel like they have the flu.

The main difference between COVID-19 and the flu is that there is a lack of immunity in the community for the new coronavirus because there is no vaccine.

Another difference is that the coronavirus appears to take about six to seven days to spread between people, whereas the flu can spread between people in four days."
Can children get coronavirus?,"Yes, although people aged under 18 are less susceptible to the virus, according to the limited clinical reports available."
Can dogs get coronavirus?,The World Health Organisation says there is currently no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus.
How long will the coronavirus last?,"Scientists are working on new technologies to try and develop a vaccine for COVID-19.

The World Health Organisation said the first vaccines targeting the disease could take 18 months to develop, which would mean August, 2021."
Why is coronavirus so bad in Italy?,"COVID-19 has a more severe effect on the elderly and people with existing medical conditions.

According to a 2019 UN report, 23 per cent of Italy's population is 65 or older."
How is it transmitted?,"The first cases of COVID-19 were believed to be linked to a live-animal market in China, but the virus has since been spreading from person to person.

Person-to-person transmission is most likely between people in close contact, about 6 feet. When a person infected with novel coronavirus sneezes or coughs, respiratory droplets could land on people nearby or could possibly be inhaled by those people.

Instead, head to an area with fewer people or exercise at off-hours, when not as many people are out and about.

Since COVID-19 can live on hard surfaces, and most playgrounds aren't cleaned and disinfected regularly, you may want to reconsider bringing your child there, especially if you live in an area with ongoing coronavirus transmissions. If you do decide to go to the playground, make sure your child stays at least 6 feet away from other children."
Can I walk my dog under the category of daily exercise?,"Yes you can.

According to government advice for people with animals, if you have a dog that needs walking, you should count this as the one form of exercise you take every day.

It's important that you should remain 2m away from anyone outside your household while walking your dog.

There is no guidance from the government on whether your dog should be on a lead, but some parks, including The Royal Parks, insist on this as a rule, to help ensure people maintain social distance.

As well as your daily exercise, you may also leave the house to care for a vulnerable person, and this care may involve walking their dog.

When you do this, you should always remember to wash your hands before and after handling the dog, and remain 2m away from the owner."
"How long does the virus live on different surfaces? A friend gets my paper and shopping, and I have meals delivered - how do I unpack?","Covid-19 is primarily spread in tiny droplets released from the nose and mouth of an infected person as they cough. The most common way for the virus to be transmitted appears to be through close contact with an infected person.

However, evidence suggests the virus can live for an extended time outside of the body, including on surfaces. If you touch a contaminated surface and then your nose or mouth, there's a possibility you could become infected.

A study published last month suggests the virus survives longest on plastic and stainless steel surfaces - up to two to three days - and can live for up to 24 hours on cardboard. However, over that time the virus is likely to become less powerful.

Where possible, it is a good idea to either disinfect the packaging with kitchen spray or discard it before washing your hands with soap and water.

For items like a newspaper that can't be washed, the likelihood of transmission is low, but it still makes sense to practise regular hand washing.

Bearing in mind the virus's durability, it's also worth regularly disinfecting plastic and stainless steel surfaces such as door handles."
"Is it safe to buy fruit and veg, including salad food that is not in any packaging and if it is not, what should I do to make it safe?","The British Retail Consortium says retailers and their suppliers are continuing to work to the highest standards of hygiene when handling products, and are observing safety processes set by the Food Standards Agency and Public Health England.

However, it makes sense to wash unpackaged items such as fruit and vegetables thoroughly under running water, before leaving them to dry. You should also then wash your hands with soap and water."
Is there a particular blood group more prone to Covid-19?,"There may be a chance some blood types have a higher risk of getting a serious dose of Covid-19 than others, a small early study suggests.

Researchers assessed 2,173 coronavirus hospital patients in Shenzhen and Wuhan in China, where the outbreak originated.

They found patients with A blood group types were more likely to have been hospitalised than average, while those with an O blood group type were less likely.

In the local population, 32% had a type A blood group, compared with 38% of those in hospital. Meanwhile, 34% of residents had type 0 blood, compared with 26% in hospital.

However, this study has not yet been peer reviewed and only covered a small area, so these links may be coincidental. Everyone should be doing all they can to avoid catching the virus and passing it on to others, regardless of their blood type."
What is the current policy on birthing partners?,"Expectant mothers should be encouraged to have a birth partner with them during labour and birth, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says, unless the partner is showing symptoms of coronavirus.

As local trusts may place restrictions on visitors, partners may not be able to go to antenatal appointments, or stay with women on antenatal or postnatal wards. But this doesn't mean they cannot attend the birth, as long as they feel well.

Some NHS trusts will allow only one birth partner to be in attendance, where previously they had allowed two. There were reports that others had banned partners' attendance altogether, before doing a U-turn on official advice.

Understandably, some pregnant women feel nervous about going into a hospital in case it increases their risk of catching the coronavirus.

Maternity units are carrying out some consultations over the phone or via video link, but some in-person visits with the midwife are essential for the wellbeing of the mother and baby, the Royal College of Midwives says.

It adds that home births may no longer be available in some local areas, mainly due to staff and ambulance shortages, but maternity wards are being kept as separate from Covid-19 treatment areas as possible."
We're about to exchange on a house but have been advised by the solicitor not to. When will restrictions on house purchases be lifted?,"There are currently no formal restrictions on moving house, although the government has strongly advised against it where possible. It says that while there is no need to pull out of transactions, buyers and renters should delay moving so they can observe social distancing and self-isolating guidelines.

If the house you are moving into is empty, it's fine to carry on as long as these rules are observed during the removals process. If the property is occupied, the government is encouraging the buyer and seller to find an alternative moving date further down the line.

Mortgage lenders have also been tightening their restrictions, with some requiring a deposit of at least 25%. But this doesn't affect mortgages which have already been agreed. Many lenders are offering customers who have already exchanged the option to extend their mortgage offer for up to three months so that they can move at a later date.

This timeframe may give you some idea of how long all of this could go on for, although nobody knows for sure.

The house buying process differs between Scotland and England and Wales, but the advice on delaying a move is the same."
Is it safe to bake a friend cake for her birthday send it to her? - Samantha,"It's hard to not be able to see our friends and family in person, especially on special occasions, so sending a gift shows we are thinking of them.
There is no evidence of Covid-19 being transmitted through food, and thorough cooking will kill the virus. The UK Food Standards Agency website has advice on food safety.
If you aren't displaying coronavirus symptoms, make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before you start baking.
If you are showing symptoms of the virus - or have been in contact with someone who has - then it's probably not a good idea to prepare food for somebody else.
That's because coronavirus spreads through small droplets - packed with the virus - expelled by a sufferer if they cough or sneeze. These can cause an infection if they are breathed in, or if someone touches a surface on which they have landed.
While the chance of contracting coronavirus through food delivery is low, it does exist.
The tin or box the cake is placed in probably presents a higher risk than the cake itself, so your friend should rinse the packaging when she receives the cake.
If you're dropping the cake off yourself, you should maintain social distancing by ensuring you stay 2m (6ft) apart from each other."
Can you catch coronavirus from your dog or cat? - Javed,"This is highly unlikely to happen, according to scientists and vets.
There have been no cases of pets passing the coronavirus to humans, and the same was true during the Sars outbreak in 2003, when there was not a single case of pet-to-human transmission.
Sars is a very closely-related virus to the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.
It is possible that a pet's fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal.
As always, you should wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead, and avoid touching your nose and mouth.
The novel coronavirus is thought to have originated in wildlife and passed to humans via a live animal market, but it is likely the first people infected actually ate infected meat. Since then it has been spread from person to person.
However, a Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo recently tested positive for the virus. She was thought to have been infected by an asymptomatic zookeeper, so there is evidence of human-to-animal transmission."
How do you practise safe sex during a pandemic?,"If you live with your partner, they count as being part of your household. If neither of you is showing coronavirus symptoms and you are already in close contact, having sex won't increase the likelihood of you catching the virus from one another. If one person does have symptoms, they should be self-isolating in a separate room.
Using contraception such as condoms won't alter your risk of catching the virus, as having sex will bring you into close physical contact anyway.
""If you are going to touch each other's genitals it's likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time - and we know the virus is passed through saliva,"" Dr Alex George told the BBC's Newsbeat.
""Essentially, any possibility of transfer of coronavirus - from your mouth to your hands, to genitals, to someone else's nose or mouth - increases the risk of passing on coronavirus."""
Are casual hook-ups dangerous? - May,"Engaging in casual hook-ups is a bad idea at the moment. It's against government guidelines to leave your home for a non-essential reason, to make unnecessary journeys or to meet up with someone who is not living with you. Having close physical contact with someone not in your household could spread coronavirus, as there is no way for you to tell whether you or the other person may be carrying it."
Is it safe to try for a baby in this coronavirus situation? - Sam,"We still don't know fully how Covid-19 affects pregnant women, but they have been placed into the ""high risk"" category meaning they should minimise all social contact.
We also don't know how long the pandemic will last, and going into hospital for essential scans and check-ups is likely to increase your risk of contracting the virus.
You could also find that birthing options are reduced and resources more stretched than usual. However, if you are already pregnant, the important thing is not to panic and to still attend essential hospital appointments."
How risky is coronavirus for teens with asthma? - Teresa,"Because coronavirus attacks the respiratory system, anyone with existing breathing problems is at higher risk. Those with severe asthma have been placed in the ""extremely vulnerable"" group, meaning they are advised to stay at home for at least 12 weeks and should have been contacted by the government.
Those with mild asthma should still practise social distancing and only go out for essentials. If you start displaying coronavirus symptoms that do not improve after seven days, or you have difficulty breathing, make sure you call 111 or 999 and explain that you have asthma.
When people with asthma get respiratory infections, it can set off their asthma symptoms. Asthma UK recommends you keep taking your preventer inhaler daily as prescribed, to help cut the risk of an asthma attack being triggered by coronavirus. You should also carry your reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up."
Are young people who smoke weed or tobacco at more risk? - Eric,"Smokers are more likely to have certain serious complications from coronavirus than other people, Public Health England says.
It points to early studies in China that indicate smokers with Covid-19 are 14 times more likely to develop severe respiratory disease.
Smoking tobacco or illegal drugs damages the lungs and airways, causing a range of respiratory problems. The coronavirus attacks the respiratory system, placing smokers at greater risk.
There is also evidence it suppresses and harms the immune system, with smokers twice as likely to catch pneumonia as non-smokers.
Smokers are also likely to regularly touch their mouth, increasing their risk of infection.
Sharing cigarettes or spliffs with others also makes you susceptible to catching coronavirus, which can be transmitted through saliva and via surfaces."
How did coronavirus start?,"It is thought the disease originated at an animal market in the city of Wuhan in China, where it was transferred to a person.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says: ""Covid-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.""
Dr Chris from Operation Ouch said: ""As a species, human beings destroy ecosystems and we often farm animals in quite cruel, crowded conditions. And those two things expose us to really dangerous viruses from animals.
""So, as a species, we all need to accept some responsibility and wake up to the fact we need to treat our planet better but, there is no one person or culture that we need to blame here."""
What are the symptoms of coronavirus?,"The most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and a dry cough.
In the UK, people are being advised to stay at home for seven days if they have either a high temperature (they feel hot to touch on their chest or back) or a new, continuous cough - or 14 days if they live with other people.
""Everyone who gets symptoms gets a fever,"" says Operation Ouch's Dr Xand.
He added: ""Most of the people who get a fever get tired. A lot of the people who get tired get achy muscles and a lot of those people get a cough. One of the things that doesn't seem to be very common is sneezing.""
The WHO says the illness it causes is ""generally mild, especially for children and young adults"", but around one in five people who get the virus become seriously ill and develop difficulty breathing.
Dr Chris added: ""If you have difficulty breathing, go to hospital."""
How does the virus spread?,"Coronavirus spreads from person to person by droplets from the nose or mouth from coughing or sneezing. People can also catch it by coming into contact with contaminated surfaces or skin.
The WHO says ""other people then catch Covid-19 (coronavirus) by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth"".
This is why people are being encouraged to regularly wash their hands with soap and to not go too near to people who have it.
""It's very unlikely it can be spread through things like packages or food"", according to NHS advice."
How long does coronavirus last?,"If you get coronavirus it takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, scientists have said, but some people will get symptoms much later than this.
""So we don't know that information for everyone, but it seems to be like a few weeks on average, something like that,"" Dr Xand said.
""People can be very ill for a few weeks and then they gradually get better,"" he added.
The UK government has said it wants everybody to stop going outside if they can to stop the virus spreading.
But it especially wants people to self-isolate if they have symptoms.
As virus expert, Dr Jake Dunning, explained, it basically means staying at home so the virus can't spread to other people.
It also means other people can't come round to visit you while you're self-isolating.
According to medical experts, 99% of people will make a full recovery, as their immune system eventually defeats the virus."
How can we limit the spread of the coronavirus?,"There are lots of things that everyone can do to help limit the spread of the coronavirus.
NHS advice says:
Regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
When you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve (not your hands!)
Try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell
As Dr Xand explained, people should stay at home if they're feeling poorly, especially if they have a temperature, a cough, or are feeling achy.
The WHO says keeping at least two metres apart from someone who might be coughing or sneezing will help stop the coronavirus spreading.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people should stay at home to help stop the spread of the virus. He has closed all sorts of places where people gather, such as shops, libraries, cinemas and places of worship, to persuade them to do this."
When will coronavirus end?,"At the moment, we don't know. It's a new virus, so experts are still trying to find out as much as they can about it.
Scientists are working on coming up with a vaccine for it though. Once they have created a vaccine they will be able to treat it effectively.
It is hoped there will be trials of a vaccine by the end of 2020."
Do hand gels work?,"Sometimes you might not be able to wash your hands with soap and water when you want to, for example while out and about, or while using public transport.
Professor Devi Sridhar told Newsround: ""Hand gels are a fantastic way to clean your hands but they're not as good as soap and water.""
NHS advice says people should use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available."
Can pets get coronavirus?,"There is some evidence that pets can be infected with the coronavirus - but it is thought they cannot infect people with it.
However, it's still important to protect yourself from bacteria that can pass between pets and humans - that means washing hands.
British Veterinary Association president Daniella Dos Santoshas suggested another reason why people should practise good hand hygiene if they have animals.
She explained: ""An animal's fur could carry the virus for a time if a pet were to have come into contact with someone who was sick.""
Doctor James is a vet on CBBC show The Pets Factor, and he's been answering questions about whether animals can catch the virus, or even if they should wear face masks for protection."
Can I walk my dog under the category of daily exercise?,"Yes you can.

According to government advice for people with animals, if you have a dog that needs walking, you should count this as the one form of exercise you take every day.

It's important that you should remain 2m away from anyone outside your household while walking your dog.

There is no guidance from the government on whether your dog should be on a lead, but some parks, including The Royal Parks, insist on this as a rule, to help ensure people maintain social distance.

As well as your daily exercise, you may also leave the house to care for a vulnerable person, and this care may involve walking their dog.

When you do this, you should always remember to wash your hands before and after handling the dog, and remain 2m away from the owner."
"How long does the virus live on different surfaces? A friend gets my paper and shopping, and I have meals delivered - how do I unpack?","Covid-19 is primarily spread in tiny droplets released from the nose and mouth of an infected person as they cough. The most common way for the virus to be transmitted appears to be through close contact with an infected person.

However, evidence suggests the virus can live for an extended time outside of the body, including on surfaces. If you touch a contaminated surface and then your nose or mouth, there's a possibility you could become infected.

A study published last month suggests the virus survives longest on plastic and stainless steel surfaces - up to two to three days - and can live for up to 24 hours on cardboard. However, over that time the virus is likely to become less powerful.

Where possible, it is a good idea to either disinfect the packaging with kitchen spray or discard it before washing your hands with soap and water.

For items like a newspaper that can't be washed, the likelihood of transmission is low, but it still makes sense to practise regular hand washing.

Bearing in mind the virus's durability, it's also worth regularly disinfecting plastic and stainless steel surfaces such as door handles."
"Is it safe to buy fruit and veg, including salad food that is not in any packaging and if it is not, what should I do to make it safe?","The British Retail Consortium says retailers and their suppliers are continuing to work to the highest standards of hygiene when handling products, and are observing safety processes set by the Food Standards Agency and Public Health England.

However, it makes sense to wash unpackaged items such as fruit and vegetables thoroughly under running water, before leaving them to dry. You should also then wash your hands with soap and water."
What is the current policy on birthing partners?,"Expectant mothers should be encouraged to have a birth partner with them during labour and birth, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says, unless the partner is showing symptoms of coronavirus.

As local trusts may place restrictions on visitors, partners may not be able to go to antenatal appointments, or stay with women on antenatal or postnatal wards. But this doesn't mean they cannot attend the birth, as long as they feel well.

Some NHS trusts will allow only one birth partner to be in attendance, where previously they had allowed two. There were reports that others had banned partners' attendance altogether, before doing a U-turn on official advice.

Understandably, some pregnant women feel nervous about going into a hospital in case it increases their risk of catching the coronavirus.

Maternity units are carrying out some consultations over the phone or via video link, but some in-person visits with the midwife are essential for the wellbeing of the mother and baby, the Royal College of Midwives says.

It adds that home births may no longer be available in some local areas, mainly due to staff and ambulance shortages, but maternity wards are being kept as separate from Covid-19 treatment areas as possible."
We're about to exchange on a house but have been advised by the solicitor not to. When will restrictions on house purchases be lifted?,"There are currently no formal restrictions on moving house, although the government has strongly advised against it where possible. It says that while there is no need to pull out of transactions, buyers and renters should delay moving so they can observe social distancing and self-isolating guidelines.

If the house you are moving into is empty, it's fine to carry on as long as these rules are observed during the removals process. If the property is occupied, the government is encouraging the buyer and seller to find an alternative moving date further down the line.

Mortgage lenders have also been tightening their restrictions, with some requiring a deposit of at least 25%. But this doesn't affect mortgages which have already been agreed. Many lenders are offering customers who have already exchanged the option to extend their mortgage offer for up to three months so that they can move at a later date.

This timeframe may give you some idea of how long all of this could go on for, although nobody knows for sure.

The house buying process differs between Scotland and England and Wales, but the advice on delaying a move is the same."
How and when do I get my check?,
Is there help for small businesses in the Senate stimulus package?,"There's a lot of focus on the individual checks, but I'm firmly of the mind the small business loan piece of this is far and away the most important given what's happening right now.

The bill directs $350 billion for loans to small businesses and nonprofits with under 500 employees. The loans would be guaranteed by the Small Business Administration but the actual lender would be approved banks and financial institutions, which should get the money out the door faster. Businesses could receive up to $10 million in loans to float employee salaries, payroll expenses, mortgage and other debt payments. If used for those purposes, the loans would be forgiven in the future. It's a huge deal if it works properly.

There are several other small business related provisions in here that may be useful and/or valuable to those who are eligible. Be sure to check them out to see if you may qualify -- a key component of this package is expanding eligibility for government programs (see: the unemployment insurance expansion/enhancement)."
"Is the check based on my 2018 or 2019 tax return?
","Under the plan, individuals who earn $75,000 in adjusted gross income or less would get direct payments of $1,200 each. But which tax return is that based on?
If you've filed for 2019, that's what it would based off of. If you haven't, it would be based off of 2018."
Does the bill include anything about student loans?,"Federal student loan borrowers would get a reprieve from payments until October and any interest that would have accrued during that period would be waived.
The agreement also allows students to keep any unspent money from Pell Grants or student loans and prevents students who have to leave school due to the pandemic from losing eligibility for future Pell Grants.
I should also note the bill explicitly allows colleges and universities to pay students for work-study programs even if they are unable to work."
Will full-time college students qualify for stimulus checks?,"Depends -- and I'm not trying to dodge here, but everyone's circumstances are different, so I don't want to generalize. Say an individual is claimed as dependent by their parents, then that's an automatic no. Say you live on your own, are not claimed as a dependent and had a summer job, then yes."
"Will retired seniors also get stimulus checks?
","So long as they are not listed as a dependent for someone else (and, as retirees, fall within the income thresholds), yes, they should receive a check."
Did Dean Koontz predict this outbreak in the book “The Eyes of Darkness” almost 40 years ago?,"No. There are some interesting coincidences in the 1981 fiction novel, which says “a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread around the globe” around the year 2020. Modern editions of the book call the biological strain “Wuhan-400,” and the current coronavirus outbreak started in Wuhan, China.
 But there are important differences between the book and reality. The original version of the book called the strain the “Gorki-400,” in reference to a Russian locality, before it was later changed to the “Wuhan-400.” In the book, the virus was man-made, while scientists believe the novel coronavirus started in animals and jumped to humans. And in the book, the virus had a 100% mortality rate. Early estimates of the mortality rate for this coronavirus outbreak range from 2-4%."
Should all Americans be under stay-at-home orders?,"“We really should be,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. 
 “If you look at what’s going on across the country, I just don’t understand why we’re not doing that.”
 President Donald Trump has declined to give a nationwide stay-at-home order.
 More than 40 states have stay-at-home orders, which generally allow exceptions for grocery shopping, helping a sick loved one or getting outdoor exercise away from other people.
 But states with fewer cases of coronavirus also need to be on high alert, Fauci said. 
 “If you just look at those (places) and say, ‘There are very little infections in this area or that area, we don’t have to worry about it,’ you’re making a big mistake,” he said. “Those are tinders that can turn into big fires.”"
How do I safely take care of someone who’s sick?,"With the shortage of coronavirus testing nationwide, it may be difficult to know whether your loved one has coronavirus or another illness.
 So it’s critical to play it safe and not infect yourself and, in turn, others. The CDC suggests: 
 
 Giving the sick person their own room to stay in, if possible. Keep the door closed.
 Having only one person serve as the caretaker.
 Asking the sick person to wear a face mask, if they are able to. If the mask causes breathing difficulties, then the caretaker should wear a mask instead."
We’ve been sheltering in place for weeks. So why are the “peaks” of hospitalizations and deaths still yet to come?,"“There is a delay because the way it goes, you have people who get exposed; they get infected; the number of new infections, hospitalizations, critical care and deaths (follow),” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 
 “So even when you suppress or stabilize the number of new infections, it’s still going to take a while before you see a decrease in hospitalizations, a decrease in intensive care, and a decrease in deaths. And in fact, deaths are the last thing that lag. So you could be doing well (with mitigation measures) and still see the deaths go up.”"
Can high or low temperatures kill coronavirus?,"“Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods of time at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments. However, we don’t have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point,” the CDC says. 
 “The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.”
 President Donald Trump suggested this coronavirus could subside by the warmer summer months, but scientists say it’s too early to tell. And the fact that coronavirus keeps spreading in the Southern Hemisphere during its summer months suggests this strain might not succumb to warmer temperatures. 
 “The short answer is that while we may expect modest declines in the contagiousness of (novel coronavirus) in warmer, wetter weather and perhaps with the closing of schools … it is not reasonable to expect these declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent,” wrote Dr. Marc Lipsitch, director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health."
Is there a cure?,"There’s currently no cure for the novel coronavirus. And while research is underway, it could be more than a year before a vaccine becomes publicly available."
"Should I wear a face mask in public? If so, how do I make one?","The CDC recently changed its guidance on wearing face masks as more studies about asymptomatic spread pile up.
 Now, the CDC “recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies).”
 But there are several important caveats and key points: 
 
 The public should NOT buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks. Those are desperately needed by health care workers who are in close contact with coronavirus patients every day. 
 Instead, make your own cloth mask — it’s easy, and you don’t have to sew. US Surgeon General Jerome Adams shows how to make face masks with just a T-shirt and rubber bands in this CDC video. You can also use a bandana and a coffee filter. 
 Don’t be fooled: The main benefit of wearing masks in public isn’t to protect you from getting sick. Rather, it’s to protect others from yourself if you’re sick or you’re an asymptomatic carrier. “This is more for people who might be infected and don’t know it, and to try and lower the likelihood that they will spread this to somebody else,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. The CDC agreed.
 You can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask. The virus can stay alive on surfaces for up to 3 days, and it’s easy to touch your face whenever you’re not wearing a mask. Also, people often adjust face masks frequently, leading to more touching of the face — a common way that coronavirus spreads.
 It’s important to wash your cloth mask after every use. Here’s how. 
 Wearing cloth masks is just “an additional, voluntary public health measure,” the CDC said. To protect yourself from getting coronavirus, it’s critical to stay 6 feet away from others, wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds each time, and stop touching your face."
Why is a cure taking so long?,"An antiviral drug must be able to target the specific part of a virus’s life cycle that is necessary for it to reproduce, according to Harvard Medical School.
 “In addition, an antiviral drug must be able to kill a virus without killing the human cell it occupies. And viruses are highly adaptive.”"
Are kids more at risk?,"“Younger people, thankfully, seem to be insulated to some extent to protect (them) from getting particularly sick from this,” said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. “We don’t know entirely why.”
 But while children might have mild to no symptoms with coronavirus, they can still get others sick.
 “They can still carry the virus in their bodies,” Gupta said. “They could potentially still shed the virus and be a source of infection.”
 Like everyone else, children should wash their hands frequently for at least 20 seconds, stay at least 6 feet away from anyone coughing or sneezing, and stop touching their faces – which is a lot harder than it sounds."
Why are medical workers getting sick with or dying from coronavirus if they’re wearing protective gear?,"Many health care workers don’t actually have enough protective gear to handle the growing influx of coronavirus patients. 
 Some have resorted to using plastic report covers as masks. The CDC said medical providers might have to use expired masks or reuse them between multiple patients. (This shortage is why the general public should not buy medical masks and instead make cloth masks at home.)
 But it’s not just subpar protective gear that puts medical workers at risk. It’s also the amount of virus they’re exposed to. 
 “The viral load — the amount of virus – does determine the severity of your illness,” emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen said. “So that could happen in the case of health care workers who are exposed to a lot more Covid-19 as a result of their work — that they get more severely ill.”"
Why worry about coronavirus when the flu kills many more people?,"The novel coronavirus is dangerous for several reasons, even if the number of deaths haven’t matched that of the flu.
 The first US case of coronavirus was reported in January, and the first US death from coronavirus was reported in late February. By April 9, the US had more than 456,800 cases of coronavirus, and more than 16,000 people have died.
 Since this flu season started October 1, more than 24,000 Americans have died from the flu, according to CDC estimates. Nationwide, the flu has infected at least 39 million people between October and late March. 
 But here are key differences when comparing the flu vs. coronavirus: 
 
 The CDC estimates for the flu go back to October 2019. But the first US case of coronavirus didn’t emerge until several months later.
 Coronavirus is twice as contagious as the flu. Research indicates a person with the flu infects an average of 1.28 other people, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. But with coronavirus, “it’s likely between 2 and 3” other people.
 Coronavirus infections have a “very high mortality rate – one in six – among people who are over 80 and people with underlying chronic disease,” epidemiologist Dr. Abdul El-Sayed said. 
 People with coronavirus might not get symptoms for 14 days, and some get no symptoms at all. But during that time, they’re still contagious and can infect others unknowingly. 
 A vaccine is available for the flu, but no vaccine is available for coronavirus. Experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got their flu shots. But about half of Americans don’t get vaccinated, including most children who die from the flu."
Should I avoid public transportation?,"If you rely on public transportation, use caution. If you’re sick or live in an area where an outbreak has been reported, avoid it. 
 Mass transit could increase your risk of exposure to coronavirus. Luckily, transit systems are upping their cleaning regimens — notably the New York subway system. 
 Dr. Robyn Gershon, a professor of epidemiology at New York University’s School of Public Health, has some tips: When you ride a bus or subway, sneeze or cough into your elbow. Use a tissue to hold onto a pole. Avoid touching your face while you’re riding, and use hand sanitizer if you have it while you’re commuting. 
 Again, wash your hands before, during and after your trip. 
 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recommends letting crowded trains or buses pass and waiting for a less crowded one. It’s nearly impossible to maintain 6 feet of distance on a packed subway car. 
 If you have a chronic illness, find alternative means of transportation — being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection."
How long does coronavirus stay “alive” on surfaces?,"Up to three days, depending on the surface. According to a study funded by the US National Institutes of Health:
 
 The novel coronavirus is viable up to 72 hours after being placed on stainless steel and plastic.
 It was viable up to four hours after being placed on copper, and up to 24 hours after being put on cardboard.
 In aerosols, it was viable for three hours."
"If infected with coronavirus, can you survive it and recover?","Absolutely. The vast majority of people with coronavirus survive. 
 The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has estimated the death rate is “about 2%.”"
Is it safe for me to vote at a polling location?,"States have received guidance from the CDC on how to keep voting locations clean. It’s up to you whether you feel comfortable going. 
 Many states that already held elections imposed measures to reduce contact between voters, increasing the distance between voting booths and rigorously disinfecting voting equipment. But if you go, remember – wash your hands before, during and afterward. 
 If you’re able to mail in your ballot, do – just don’t lick the envelope. 
 If you think you have a fever or respiratory symptoms, the CDC advises that you stay home. It’s unfortunate to skip out on your civic duty, but sick people shouldn’t visit crowded locations."
Should I spray myself or my kids with disinfectant?,"No. Those products work on surfaces but can be dangerous to your body. 
 There are some chemical disinfectants, including bleach, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform, that may kill the virus on surfaces. 
 But if the virus is already in your body, putting those substances on your skin or under your nose won’t kill it, the World Health Organization says. Not to mention, those chemicals can harm you. 
 And please – do not ingest chemical disinfectants."
"If people can spread the virus without showing any symptoms, how can I tell who’s infected and who’s not?","You can’t, said Dr. James Phillips, chief of disaster and operational medicine at George Washington University Hospital.
 “We’re so far behind on testing, there’s only one way we can be certain not to transmit the virus and be certain not to get it ourselves: We need to start treating every person as though they have this, ” Phillips said. 
 “And everyone needs to treat us like we have it, and socially distance ourselves in that manner. Because until we have (enough) testing, we don’t know who has this. And we’re not sure when they start spreading it.” 
 That’s why it’s so critical to avoid crowds, stay at least 6 feet away from others, wash or disinfect your hands, and stop touching your face."
What can I do if my loved one suspects they have coronavirus?,"Don’t visit family members with suspected illness – keep up with them virtually.
 If that loved one lives with you, limit contact with them and avoid using the same bathroom or bedroom, the CDC advises.
 If they’ve been diagnosed, they may be able to recover at home in isolation. Separate yourself as much as possible from your infected family member and keep animals away, too. Continue to use separate restrooms and regularly disinfect them with EPA-approved products.
 Stock up on groceries and household supplies for them while they can’t travel outside and minimize trips to stores. Wash your hands frequently and avoid sharing personal items with the infected person.
 If you suspect you’re developing symptoms, stay home and call your physician."
My ex and I have joint custody of our kids. Is it safe for them to go between two homes?,"Ideally, you should limit your children’s potential exposures to coronavirus and work out the safest plan possible with your ex. 
 The problem: Most state and county family courts are closed, or open only for emergencies involving abuse or endangerment. So if parents wanted to formally modify pre-existing custody agreements, they can’t.
 But some states may be offering some flexibility during the pandemic. And there may be creative solutions, such as spending more time with one parent now in exchange for extra time with the other parent after the pandemic ends."
Should I go to work?,"If you can, you should stay home from work when you’re sick, whether or not you have coronavirus. 
 Many companies are increasingly flexible with work from home policies. If your company is allowing employees to work from home, consider it. Some companies have enforced working from home. 
 If you must go into work, maintain 6 feet of distance from your colleagues, wash your hands frequently and practice good respiratory etiquette by coughing or sneezing into your elbow.
 Avoid handshakes, switch in-person meetings to teleconferences and disinfect your workspace with EPA-approved products at the start of your shift."
"After recovering from coronavirus, does a person have long-term immunity to the virus?","It’s too early to know for sure. But other coronaviruses, like ones that cause the common cold, might give us clues. 
 With “common cold coronaviruses, you don’t actually have immunity that lasts for very long, and so we don’t know the answer with this specific coronavirus,” said Dr. Celine Gounder, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the New York University School of Medicine.
 “That’s actually going to be one of the challenges with designing a vaccine is how do you actually cause the immunity to last long enough to protect you.”"
How long does it take to recover?,"“It takes anything up to six weeks to recover from this disease,” said Dr. Michael Ryan of the World Health Organization. 
 “People who suffer very severe illness can take months to recover from the illness.”
 Recovery is often marked by a patient no longer showing symptoms and having two consecutive negative tests at least one day apart, Ryan said. But there is no known cure for the novel coronavirus."
Can coronavirus go through skin and into the body?,"“It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads,” the CDC says. 
 More often than not, people get coronavirus through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
 “These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs,” the CDC says."
"Since a plane's cabin keeps circulating air, will I get sick if another passenger is sick?","Most viruses don’t spread easily on airplanes because of how the air circulates and is filtered, the CDC says. 
 Modern commercial jets recirculate 10-50% of the air in the cabin, mixed with outside air. 
 “The recirculated air passes through a series of filters 20-30 times per hour,” the CDC says. 
 “Furthermore, air generally circulates in defined areas within the aircraft, thus limiting the radius of distribution of pathogens spread by small-particle aerosols. As a result, the cabin air environment is not conducive to the spread of most infectious diseases.”
 Still, try to avoid contact with anyone sneezing or coughing. And if you’re feeling sick, cover your entire mouth and nose with the inside of your elbow when you cough or sneeze."
"Now that a tiger has tested positive, could my pet get coronavirus from me? Or could I become infected by my pet?","“There have been no reports of pets or livestock becoming ill with COVID-19 in the United States, and only four reported cases in the world of dogs and cats testing positive for the virus,” the American Veterinary Medical Association said April 5.
 “At this point in time, there is no evidence that domestic animals, including pets and livestock, can spread COVID-19 to people.”
 That statement came after the Bronx Zoo said a tiger was infected by a zoo employee who was “asymptomatically infected with the virus.” The zoo had been closed to the public since March 16.
 The AVMA said “out of an abundance of caution, and until more is known about this virus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19.”
 “If you have a service animal or you must care for your animals, including pets, wear a cloth facemask; don’t share food, kiss, or hug them; and wash your hands before and after any contact with them,” the veterinary association said.
 “If you are not ill with COVID-19, you can interact with your pet as you normally would, including walking, feeding, and playing. You should continue to practice good hygiene during those interactions,” including washing your hands before and after touching your pet."
I’ve heard that home remedies can cure or prevent the virus. Is that true?,"There’s no evidence from the outbreak that eating garlic, sipping water every 15 minutes or taking vitamin C will protect people from the new coronavirus. Same goes for using essential oils, colloidal silver and steroids."
Why doesn’t the US have enough medical supplies to handle this outbreak?,"Top healthcare officials say the US does not have enough stockpiled medical equipment like masks, gowns and gloves to meet the anticipated need as this pandemic grows.
 There are several reasons hospitals are on track to face dire shortages, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert and professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 
 “About 20 or 30 years ago, we decided that we would not over-hospitalize,” Schaffner said.
 Back then, hospitals often had empty hospital beds for new patients. But now, many hospitals are “absolutely full,” Schaffner said. “We have under-built hospital beds because they are very expensive.”
 Also, Americans have grown accustomed to “just-in-time” ordering. But that becomes a huge problem when international supply chains are disrupted by an outbreak. “We didn’t anticipate international turbulence influencing this,” Schaffner said.
 Now, some health care workers are making their own masks. They’ve also been told they can use bandanas or scarves as masks."
My teenagers aren’t taking this seriously. Any advice?,"Coronavirus isn’t just infecting young people. It’s killing young, healthy people as well. 
 We’ve reported many stories about young people getting severely sick with or dying from coronavirus. 
 Dimitri Mitchell, 18, admits he had a “false sense of security.” But he was later hospitalized with coronavirus and now wants everyone to take it seriously. 
 “I just want to make sure everybody knows that no matter what their age is, it can seriously affect them. And it can seriously mess them up, like it messed me up,” Mitchell said. 
 He started feeling sick on St. Patrick’s Day, with just a small cough. “I thought at first it was just a normal cold. And then it started progressively getting worse,” he said. 
 “Four days in, the really bad symptoms started coming along. I started having really bad outbreaks, like sweating, and my eyes were really watery. I was getting warmer and warmer, and I was super fatigued. … I would start experiencing the worst headaches I’ve ever felt in my life. They were absolutely horrible.”
 Eventually, the teen had to be hospitalized. His mother said she worried he might “fall asleep and never wake up.” 
 Mitchell is now recovering, but still has a cough almost a month later. 
 “I just hope everybody’s responsible, because it’s nothing to joke about,” he said. “It’s a real problem, and I want everybody to make sure they’re following social distancing guidelines and the group limits. And just listen to all the rules and precautions and stay up to date with the news and make sure they’re informed.”"
What are the symptoms?,"Fever, dry cough and difficulty breathing are hallmarks of coronavirus. 
 Symptoms may appear anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks after exposure, the CDC says. But some people get no symptoms at all and can infect others without knowing it.
 The illness varies in its severity, and many patients can recover at home in isolation."
What happens when workers don't get paid sick leave?,"If you work in a city or state that requires sick leave and you use it, you can‘t be terminated or disciplined. 
 But there is no federal mandate that requires companies to offer paid sick leave, and almost a quarter of all US workers don’t get it, according to 2019 government data. Some state and local governments have passed laws that require companies to offer paid sick leave.
 The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) can sometimes protect a worker’s job in the event they get sick, but it won’t guarantee they get paid while they’re out. 
 Employee advocates urge businesses to consider the special circumstances of the coronavirus, and some already have. Uber and Olive Garden are two that recently updated their sick leave policies to adjust to the pandemic."
How does this coronavirus spread?,"It primarily spreads between people through respiratory droplets, like through coughs, sneezes, spittle. 
 You can also get coronavirus by touching infected surfaces, then touching your mouth, eyes or nose."
Is it safe to eat takeout from restaurants? Can I get coronavirus through food?,"Yes, it is safe to eat takeout.
 There’s no evidence to suggest coronavirus is transmitted through food, the CDC says. It’s mainly spread through respiratory droplets.
 Even if coronavirus does get into your food, your stomach acid would kill it, said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University.
 “When you eat any kind of food, whether it be hot or cold, that food is going to go straight down into your stomach, where there’s a high acidity, low-pH environment that will inactivate the virus,” she said.
 But it’s a good idea to disinfect the takeout containers, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. Coronavirus is a respiratory virus, and it’s easy to touch your face without realizing it.
 If you don’t have disinfecting wipes, use your own plates or bowls to serve the food. Just make sure to wash your hands after transferring food from the containers."
Why waste a test kit on a person without symptoms?,"Some people with coronavirus have mild or no symptoms. And in some cases, symptoms don’t appear until up to 14 days after infection. 
 During that incubation period, it’s possible to get coronavirus from someone with no symptoms. It’s also possible you may have coronavirus without feeling sick and are accidentally infecting others. 
 So anyone who has had close contact with someone known to have coronavirus should ask a health care provider about getting tested, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said."
Can I have the flu and coronavirus at the same time?,"Yes. Testing positive for either the flu or coronavirus doesn’t exempt you from having the other at the same time. 
 The flu and coronavirus share some common symptoms, such as fever and cough.
 But many coronavirus patients suffer from shortness of breath, and some people with coronavirus lose their senses of taste or smell. But it’s important to note many people with coronavirus — possibly up to 50% — have no symptoms at all.
 Learn more about the differences between flu, coronavirus and allergy symptoms here."
Will a pneumonia or flu vaccine help protect against coronavirus?,"Some cases of coronavirus do lead to pneumonia. But the pneumonia vaccine won’t help.
 “Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, only help protect people from these specific bacterial infections,” according to Harvard Medical School.
 “They do not protect against any coronavirus pneumonia.”
 The flu shot does not protect against coronavirus. But it does help protect against a massive, unnecessary burden on hospitals already overwhelmed with coronavirus.
 The CDC estimates about 140,000 to 810,000 people are hospitalized with the flu every year in the US. And about half of Americans don’t get vaccinated – including most children who die from the flu."
The stores are all out of disinfectant sprays and hand sanitizer. Can I make my own?,"Yes, you can make both at home.
 “Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted” if you’re trying to kill coronavirus on a non-porous surface, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. 
 The CDC’s recipe calls for diluting 5 tablespoons (or ⅓ cup) of bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons of bleach per quart of water. 
 You can also make your own hand sanitizer. The Nebraska Medical Center – famous for its biocontainment unit and treatment of Ebola patients – offers this recipe:
 What you’ll need:
 
 2/3 cup 91% isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol)
 1/3 cup aloe vera gel
 Mixing bowl
 Spoon or something for whisking
 Small container, such as a 3 oz. travel bottle
 Optional: essential oil to give your hand sanitizer a fragrance
 
 Directions:
In a mixing bowl, stir isopropyl alcohol and aloe vera gel together until well blended.
Add 8-10 drops of scented essential oil (optional, but nice). Stir to incorporate.
Pour the homemade hand sanitizer into an empty container and seal.
Write “hand sanitizer” on a piece of masking tape and attach to the bottle."
Is coronavirus more contagious than the flu?,"Yes. 
 Research indicates a person with the flu infects about 1.28 other people, on average, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.
 But with the novel coronavirus, he said, “it’s likely between 2 and 3” other people."
"How can someone spread coronavirus when asymptomatic? If they’re not sneezing or coughing, how can they infect others?","It’s easy for asymptomatic people to spread coronavirus, said Dr. Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at UCLA’s School of Public Health.
 “When you speak, sometimes you’ll spit a little bit,” she said. “You’ll rub your nose. You’ll touch your mouth. You’ll rub your eyes. And then you’ll touch other surfaces, and then you will be spreading virus if you are infected and shedding asymptomatically.”"
Can I get coronavirus from a package sent from China?,"No. “The new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting Covid-19 cases,” the World Health Organization says. 
 “Even though the new coronavirus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days (depending on the type of surface), it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperatures,” WHO said. 
 Again, the best ways to prevent transmission is to stay 6 feet away from others, thoroughly wash your hands, and disinfect surfaces with EPA-approved products."
Why is the US so far behind other countries with testing?,"Experts say it’s due to cuts in federal funding for public health and problems with early testing. 
 Problems with public health infrastructure Two years ago, the CDC stopped funding epidemic prevention activities in 39 countries, including China. This happened because the Trump administration refused to allocate money to a program that started during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. 
 Former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden warned that move “would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world.”
 Problems with the testing Malfunctions, shortages and delays in availability have all contributed to the slowdown. 
 In the first few weeks of the outbreak in the US, the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results — even though a World Health Organization test became available around the same time. 
 Some test kits that were sent around the country were flawed — a move that put the US behind about “four to five weeks,” says Dr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare."
"If a coronavirus patient progresses to pneumonia, what antibiotics if any have proven to be effective?","No, antibiotics are not effective against coronavirus because the disease is a viral infection, not a bacterial infection. 
 “However, if you are hospitalized for the [coronavirus], you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible,” the World Health Organization says. 
 There is no known cure for the coronavirus. Researchers are studying whether the antiviral drug remdesivir might work, but testing of that drug just started.
 For now, coronavirus patients get “supportive” treatment, “which means giving fluids, medicine to reduce fever, and, in severe cases, supplemental oxygen,” the Harvard Medical School says."
I’ve heard that black people can’t get coronavirus.,"Anyone can get coronavirus.
 Any person who comes into close contact with someone who is infected is at risk for contracting the virus, according to the CDC.
 “Black people can get coronavirus, just like other people,” said Dr. Jennifer Caudle, an African-American family physician who has also been debunking coronavirus myths. 
 Caudle said she worries that some people may not take proper precautions to protect themselves against the virus because they may have heard this myth.
 In Africa, the pandemic is gaining a foothold. So far, the virus hasn’t spread in Africa as quickly as it has on some other continents. But numbers there are rising fast."
Can the heat from a hand dryer kill coronavirus?,"Hand dryers can’t kill the virus, according to WHO. The organization also says that UV lamps shouldn’t be used to sterilize hands or other areas of the body because the radiation can irritate skin.
 Drinking hot water or taking hot baths won’t kill it, either."
I’ve heard that home remedies can cure or prevent the virus.,"There’s no evidence from the outbreak that eating garlic, sipping water every 15 minutes or taking vitamin C will protect people from the new coronavirus. Same goes for using essential oils, colloidal silver and steroids.
 Some posts have suggested that putting sesame oil on your body or spraying yourself with alcohol or chlorine will kill the virus. That’s also false."
"How and when do I get my check?
","President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin have targeted April 6. Tax experts (and lawmakers working on this) are very skeptical of that date. There's no question they want -- and need to turn this around -- ASAP. There are also different ways it could be done -- through direct deposit (which would be the quickest delivery mechanism), through mailing a paper check or even, according to some people involved in the discussions, through mailing pre-loaded debit cards. But the reality is there isn't a firm answer yet. In other words, Treasury has a lot of work ahead of it."
"Is the check based on my 2018 or 2019 tax return?
","Under the plan, individuals who earn $75,000 in adjusted gross income or less would get direct payments of $1,200 each. But which tax return is that based on?
If you've filed for 2019, that's what it would based off of. If you haven't, it would be based off of 2018."
Does the bill include anything about student loans?,"Federal student loan borrowers would get a reprieve from payments until October and any interest that would have accrued during that period would be waived.
The agreement also allows students to keep any unspent money from Pell Grants or student loans and prevents students who have to leave school due to the pandemic from losing eligibility for future Pell Grants.
I should also note the bill explicitly allows colleges and universities to pay students for work-study programs even if they are unable to work."
"Will retired seniors also get stimulus checks?
","So long as they are not listed as a dependent for someone else (and, as retirees, fall within the income thresholds), yes, they should receive a check."
Can you contract COVID-19 more than once?,"There have been media reports in China, Japan, and South Korea about
individuals who had the virus and eventually tested negative for it and were
released, only to test positive for it again a short time later.

Scientists in those countries have speculated that testing errors could be to
blame, either for a false negative that said the patients were free of the
virus or for the positive result that signalled its reoccurrence.

Dr. Iris Gorfinkel, a family physician and medical researcher, said it’s
really too soon to know whether an individual can contract COVID-19 more than
once, and how quickly that can happen.

“We actually don’t know. We don’t know how long-lasting the immunity is to
it,” she told CTV’s Your Morning on March 16. “These viruses have the tendency
to morph and change.”

In fact, it’s still not even clear if people develop an immediate immunity to
COVID-19, as is typically the case with other virus strains, such as the flu.

“So just like any other virus, there’s the possibility that it could shift or
drift. Just minor changes could change it from a once mild infection to a more
severe infection,” she explained."
"Can you contract two viruses at the same time, such as new coronavirus and the flu?","While it’s still unclear if someone can contract the new coronavirus more than
once, it is possible to have more than one different virus at the same time.

Dr. Isaac Bogoch said it’s absolutely possible for someone to have COVID-19
and a strain of the flu or another virus simultaneously.

“We sound like broken records in the medical and scientific community, but for
the last two months we’ve been saying ‘We’ve got to prepare for this. We’ve
got to prepare for this. Optimize your health,’” he told CTV’s Your Morning on
March 20.

Bogoch said people should “optimize” their health by getting vaccinated for
everything that they are eligible to be vaccinated for, such as influenza or
bacterial pneumonias.

“It’s totally possible to have what’s called a co-infection and we know people
who have multiple infections at the same time can have a worse outcome,” he
said.

"
"How do you know if you have a cold, the flu, or COVID-19?","Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have few to no symptoms, according to
the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). If symptoms are present, they can
easily be mistaken for a common cold or the flu because of their similarities.

According to the health agency, the main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever,
coughing, difficulty breathing, and pneumonia in both lungs. In severe cases,
the illness can even result in death.

The World Health Organization lists additional symptoms that have been
documented in some COVID-19 patients, including tiredness, aches and pains,
sore throat, diarrhea, nausea and runny nose.

Gorfinkel said clinicians can’t distinguish between the illnesses based on
symptoms alone. She said they can all present the same way, which is why the
patient’s travel history or history of exposure to the virus is so important
in determining whether someone might have COVID-19.

“We do not have the facilities or the tests to test absolutely everybody, so
that history of travel if you’re basically otherwise well, that’s a critical
part of it,” she explained."
Can young people fall seriously ill?,"While much of the attention about who is most vulnerable to COVID-19 has
centred on the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions, [it can
also affect young people.](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/people-
under-40-make-up-one-third-of-canada-s-covid-19-cases-1.4872884)

According to PHAC data, people in their 20s were responsible for 12 per cent
of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada as of March 30, and those aged 19 or
younger made up 4 per cent of the country's total caseload.

Dr. Isaac Bogoch said that everyone can be infected by the novel coronavirus
and there’s always a risk that some people will have a more severe infection.

However, he said older people and those with underlying medical conditions
still have a greater risk of a severe outcome than younger individuals.

“If we take a step back and look at the 30,000-foot view and look at who is
more likely to get a severe infection, it is overwhelmingly those over the age
of 60 and really, over the age of 80 years old,” he told CTV’s Your Morning on
March 20.

Bogoch said the most important metric to look at when studying data about
severe infections from this virus is death.

“If you get infected, you either live or you die, it sounds morbid, but I
think that’s an extremely important distinction to make and if we look at
death, it is overwhelmingly in those over 60 and disproportionately high in
those over the age of 80,” he said."
Should you avoid Advil and other anti-inflammatories?,"France’s health minister set off a wave of confusion when he warned that the
use of ibuprofen could become an “aggravating factor” for infection in
COVID-19 cases; however, the World Health Organization says there are no
reports to support this claim.

In an official response, the WHO said it’s not recommending against the use of
the common painkiller.

“We are also consulting with physicians treating COVID-19 patients and are not
aware of reports of any negative effects of ibuprofen, beyond the usual known
side-effects that limit its use in certain populations,” the WHO said in an
update on March 18.

Bogoch agreed with the WHO, saying there is still not enough data on the
subject.

“The short answer is we’re not entirely sure if this is going to do anything
or not. It’s unlikely to have any effect whatsoever,” he told CTV’s Your
Morning on March 19.

For individuals who suspect they may have COVID-19 and are suffering from a
low-grade fever or another type of pain, Bogoch said they can take ibuprofen
or other over-the-counter medications, such as acetaminophen."
"If you have been in isolation because one person in your household is sick, do you have to continue to stay home for another two weeks if another person falls ill?","For people living in households with multiple residents, it may be difficult
to avoid infecting each other. Dr. Isaac Bogoch says that if someone becomes
sick with COVID-19, the best course of action is to call the local public
health authority.

“It’s extremely important to call the local public health hotline to discuss
the exact situation so they can give you very specific recommendations based
on your unique setting,” he told CTV’s Your Morning.

In general, though, it appears the answer to that question may be a 'yes.'
PHAC says that anyone who has been in contact with a suspected, probably or
confirmed case of COVID-19 should self-isolate for 14 days, starting at the
time of contact.

This approach was taken by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who entered self-
isolation with his family after Sophie Gregoire Trudeau tested positive for
the virus. Once his wife was given the all clear, the prime minister said he
would [remain in isolation](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/trudeau-
says-he-ll-keep-self-isolating-announces-new-help-for-
charities-1.4873202)until it had been two weeks since their last contact
before the clearance.

"
Who is getting tested?,"There is a test that can detect the presence of COVID-19 in a patient, but
jammed health-care systems mean many Canadians may make it through the
pandemic without ever knowing if they had contracted the virus.

Canada does not have formal criteria for determining who should be tested,
meaning guidelines vary from province to province. Health-care workers are
generally advised to prioritize testing only those who are showing symptoms of
COVID-19, particularly if they are in hospitals, long-term care homes or other
institutional settings where they could easily spread the virus, as well as
symptomatic travellers entering Canada.

More than 240,000 tests for COVID-19 have been conducted in Canada as of March
31.

Anyone who is showing symptoms of COVID-19 and is concerned they may have
acquired the virus should contact their doctor or other primary health-care
provider."
Can you still gather with friends in small groups?,"As physical distancing recommendations have evolved, it has become clear that
authorities do not want anyone to get close to anyone from outside their
household unless absolutely necessary.

""Stay home"" has become the refrain from political and public health leaders
seeking to flatten the curve of COVID-19 infectiuons.

""Physical distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce
the spread of illness during an outbreak,"" PHAC says on its website, which
recommends that all Canadians avoid ""non-essential"" gatherings.

Gorfinkel said people should aim to avoid all unnecessary contact with
individuals to prevent further spread in their communities.

“Stop the spread because so many people have mild symptoms. That’s the
problem,” she said. “They’re the source where the majority of cases are going
to come from.”"
"Do previous immunizations, such as the flu shot, help protect against COVID-19?","While there have been suggestions that a regular flu shot can help protect
individuals against COVID-19, Bogoch said that’s not true.

“They do not protect against this particular infection. They do not protect
against COVID-19,” he said.

However, Bogoch stressed that vaccinations such as the flu shot are still
extremely important for optimizing health.

“We should be up to date on all our routine vaccinations, our pneumonia
vaccines, our flu vaccines, our regular vaccines, so that we can ensure that
our health is optimized in case we come down with an infection,” he said."
Should seniors and children be separated if they live in the same home?,"While children appear to be less affected by the virus, elderly people and
those with other medical issues are more at risk of suffering a severe outcome
from a COVID-19 infection. For families that have both seniors and young
children living under the same roof, Bogoch said they should take care to
separate them if anyone shows symptoms. However, he said that should be the
case for anyone who is living with others and exhibits any symptoms, such as
fever, coughing, and difficulty breathing.

“You just have to be very mindful if anyone has any symptoms whatsoever they
should be separated,” he said."
How can caregivers protect themselves while helping someone with COVID-19 at home?,"For people who are caring for a person who has been diagnosed with COVID-19,
the Public Health Agency of Canada has a number of tips on how they can
protect themselves while they provide care.

According to PHAC, only one healthy person should provide care to the
individual with COVID-19, and that person should limit their contact with them
as much as possible. They should also not share personal items with them, such
as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices. The ill
person should have their own bathroom, if possible. If not, they should put
the toilet lid down every time before flushing.

Caregivers should wear a mask, disposable gloves, and eye protection when
they’re in close proximity to the patient and never reuse the mask or gloves.
They should also frequently wash their hands with soap and water, especially
after contact with the sick individual.

What’s more, caregivers should remain vigilant about monitoring themselves for
symptoms for 14 days."
Should you wipe down all of your groceries when you return from the store?,"While the SARS-CoV-2 virus can linger on surfaces from anywhere to a couple of
hours to a few days, Dr. Isaac Bogoch said it’s not necessary to wipe down
groceries after buying them at the store.

“I think if people go to the grocery store, they get groceries, I think it’s
just fair to put them away,” he told CTV’s Your Morning.

As for fruits and vegetables, Bogoch said there is no need to take any extra
precautions with those and people can simply wash them with tap water before
eating them, as they normally should.  

"
How bad will things get in Canada?,"COVID-19 has caused widespread destruction around the world, with even
developed nations including Italy, France and Spain reporting thousands of
deaths and completely overwhelmed health-care systems.

The situation was rapidly deteriorating into something similar in the U.S. by
March 31, with New York City's iconic Central Park [turning into a makeshift
hospital](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/scenes-from-the-epicentre-
grim-images-from-new-york-city-1.4874424) and experts predicting [82,000
deaths](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/82-000-people-could-die-in-
u-s-from-coronavirus-by-august-model-cited-by-white-house-1.4875601) even in a
best-case scenario.

Canada has thus far avoided the worst of the outbreak, but experts are unable
to say whether that will continue – in fact, they're [unable to offer any
credible forecasts at all](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/when-
will-canada-pass-the-peak-of-covid-19-even-the-experts-don-t-know-1.4869852).

Projecting the spread of the virus through Canada at this point is nearly
impossible because of several factors, including uncertainty over how many
Canadians have actually been infected, unknowns around whether Canadians are
following public health recommendations well enough to curb COVID-19's spread,
and the lag time between when an infection occurs and when it is reflected in
the data.

""We don't exactly know where we are on the epidemic curve, and we don't
exactly know where we were when we started having our strong public health
response,"" Dr. Ashleigh Tuite, an expert in modelling the spread of infectious
diseases, told CTVNews.ca on March 26."
Will there be a second wave of infections?,"With public health officials warning that Canadians must adhere to physical
distancing policies in order to “flatten the curve” of infections, as Hong
Kong and Singapore successfully did, other experts are expressing concerns
about a “second wave” of infections after those regions experienced another
spike in cases when they relaxed some of those measures.

Bogoch said that it’s possible Canada will experience a similar fate, if
people aren’t diligent about maintaining isolation and physical distancing
orders.

“If we take our foot off the gas pedal, when we start to lift some of these
measures because we start to see the curve flattening, we have to be prepared
that there might be a second spike in cases,” he explained.  

"
What is Coronavirus?,"Coronavirus is a type of virus that causes disease in animals. Often the symptoms of the virus are those of the common cold. Covid-19 is a strain of coronavirus that is new to humans, hence it's called a novel (or new) virus."
How did it start?,"The virus is one of the few that can be transmitted from animals to humans. It is believed to have originated in bats, which perhaps infected live animals and seafood sold at a ""wet market"" in Wuhan, a crowded, not so sanitary dense marketplace. Bats are also hosts for Ebola, HIV, and rabies.

The first person who contracted the virus on December 1, 2019, had no connection to the outdoor market, making it unclear how he contracted it in the first place. 

Others who shopped there came down with viral pneumonia from Covid-19."
How does Coronavirus get transmitted?,Covid-19 can be passed from person to person through droplets from coughs and sneezes. 
How to protect yourself from Covid-19,"As Covid-19 is spread through droplets, it can reach us through the air. Therefore, maintain social distancing, which means remaining 6 feet away from others.  Ideally, you shouldn't touch any surface on which droplets may have landed. The best way to protect yourself from exposed surfaces is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water for a count of 20. The children’s book Coronavirus You Can’t Scare Me teaches kids through pictures and rhyme:

I wash my hands throughout the day/ And count from one to twenty/ The palms, the backs, the fingernails/ With soap and water plenty.

Coronavirus You Can’t Scare Me written by the author
The best way to ensure you're doing all the above is to stay home if you can. Talk to your friends and family on the phone, social media, Skype or Zoom."
Why do I have to stay at home?,"Staying home prevents you from contracting the virus. But, more than that, it prevents you from transmitting the virus to others. Governments, health organizations and medical professionals are urging us to stay at home to flatten the curve.  "
What exactly does it mean to flatten the curve?,"Flattening the curve refers to the rate at which people are getting infected. Without intervention, the number of individuals who contract Covid-19 rises exponentially, which means it doubles at a constant rate — in this case, every three days. At such a rate, the number of infected individuals will overwhelm our hospital system, because we simply don't have enough hospital beds and respirators to treat them all. The United States doesn't even have enough protective equipment at present to protect its own health care workers. 

Doing the math, if one person is infected with the virus on Jan 1, with the number of people infected people doubling every 3 days, then by March 31, over 1 billion people will have become infected. With the world population being around 7.8 billion, it would only take until April 9 for all of us to be infected.

The situation in Italy has shown us that, without enough equipment, hospitals will be compelled to turn away some of the most infirmed among us, resulting in increased fatalities.  

Staying home does not prevent you from contracting the virus down the line, but from contracting the virus and overwhelming the medical establishment now. Postponing exposure buys time for the scientific and medical community to develop effective treatments or a vaccine to minimize or protect against infection."
"I hear it is only dangerous in older people and those with compromised immune systems.
","According to the most recent report by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of hospitalizations and deaths were greatest among those between 65 - 74. Yet 20% of those hospitalized for severe symptoms of Covid-19 were between the ages of 20-44 years.  "
What is the incubation period?,Symptoms show up 14 days after exposure to the virus.
Symptoms of Covid-19,"The most common symptoms reported are cough, fever, and shortness of breath. For some, these symptoms lead to respiratory distress and pneumonia. Other symptoms reported by those who have been infected are severe aches and pains, chills and a temporary loss of smell (and taste). Some people who contract Covid-19 experience no symptoms at all."
Testing for Covid-19,"The most common test for Covid-19 is an invasive nasal swab inserted all the way back to your nasal pharyngeal region, where the respiratory tract meets the back of your throat, where cells are collected.  "
Who should get tested?,"Tests are limited and most state and local health authorities will tell you not to get tested, even if you have symptoms, unless:

You have symptoms and were recently in contact with someone who tested positive for Coronavirus.
You have symptoms and need to be hospitalized.
Cotton swabs and tests are in short supply, so if you do not fall into the above two categories, chances are your doctor will not order a test.  

Still, if you have symptoms, call your medical doctor to be advised on how to proceed. You most likely will be directed to self-quarantine for 14 days.

For all of us, stay safe, stay home, keep your distance, wash your hands often and thoroughly with soap and water, and cover your coughs and sneezes."
Can I get these loans and unemployment?,"This was the most commonly asked question. The CARES Act not only provides relief for small business owners through loans but also allows the self-employed, independent contractors and part-time workers to collect unemployment benefits.
That initially seemed like double dipping to me. But as a colleague in the Twitterverse pointed out, it could make sense if your unemployment is covering personal expenses while your EIDL and/or PPP is covering other operating expenses. For example, if you are a restaurant owner, you have to pay for a mortgage, paid leave and supply chain disruptions, while we all wait out stay-at-home orders. But you also have to buy groceries and pay your home utility bills. If you can only get a loan to cover business expenses, you may still need unemployment benefits to pay your personal expenses.
Keep in mind, the details for unemployment benefits — eligibility rules, benefit amounts, length of payments, etc. — vary from state to state. In Illinois, for instance, to maintain your eligibility for unemployment, you must be able to work, you have to be available to accept a job and you have to be looking for work. If the additional loan funds allow you to keep running your business, it may be hard to demonstrate that you’re out of work.
I’ve already heard from a few self-employed people who have applied for unemployment—and had widely varying results. Most likely the rules will become clearer in time, as the states decide what will and won’t be allowed."
Can I get an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) and a Paycheck Protection Program Loan (PPP)?,"Yes, you can get both loans, but the key is to use the money to cover different expenses. Section 1102(a)(2)(G), the section outlining the PPP loans, explains the borrower requirements. It says the borrower has to certify that “the eligible recipient has not received amounts under this subsection for the same purpose and duplicative amounts.”
As a reminder, EIDLs can be used to cover:

Paid sick leave to employees unable to work due to the direct effect of COVID-19. Maintain payroll Increased costs due to supply chain disruption Rent or mortgage payments Repaying obligations that cannot be met due to revenue loss

PPP loan funds can be used to cover:

Payroll costs Group health care benefits during periods of paid, sick, medical, or family leave, and insurance premiums. Interest on a mortgage obligation Rent, under lease agreements in force before February 15, 2020 Utilities, for which service began before February 15, 2020 Interest on any debt incurred before February 15, 2020

So, if you’re getting an EIDL to cover payroll expenses, you can’t get a PPP to cover payroll for the length of the forgiveness period (eight weeks from when the loan is due). You would have to use the EIDL for different operating expenses or payroll for a different period. This will also go for other state or local assistance.
That being said, you don’t have to have both. If you’ve already gotten an EIDL for payroll purposes but just want the PPP loan, you can refinance the loan into a PPP. Any amount that was given to you as a grant under the EIDL will reduce the amount forgiven under PPP."
I work by myself and pay contractors. Do I still have payroll?,"Many sole proprietors or independent contractors have wondered what counts as payroll, if they don’t have any employees. Section 1102(a)(2)(A)(viii)(bb) expands the definition of payroll costs to include “the sum of payments of any compensation to or income of a sole proprietor or independent contractor that is a wage, commission, income, net earnings from self-employment or similar compensation that is not more than $100,000.”
In its most recent guidance, the SBA clarified that while income of sole proprietors and independent contractors count as payroll, payments to independent contractors do not count: “independent contractors have the ability to apply for a PPP loan on their own so they do not count for purposes of a borrower’s PPP loan calculation.”
Payroll also includes payment of compensation to employees for:

Salary, wages, commission (not to exceed $100,000) Cash tips or equivalent Vacation, parental, family, medical or sick leave Severance or separation pay and any retirement benefit Group health care benefit pay including insurance premiums State and local tax on the compensation of employees"
What is this eight-week formula everyone keeps talking about?,"This is the formula to figure out if your loan forgiveness under PPP will be reduced. I like the US. Chamber of Commerce illustration for figuring this out. You take your payroll costs and multiply them by a fraction. The top half of the fraction has the average number of full-time equivalent employees (FTE) per month for the eight weeks beginning on loan origination. The bottom half has either the average number of FTEs per month from February 15, 2019 to June 30, 2019 OR the average number of FTEs per month from January 1, 2020 to February 29, 2020. Seasonal employers use February 15, 2019 to June 30, 2019."
"Is it REALLY all forgiven, if used appropriately?","Yep. If you use the PPP loan for one of the purposes listed above for the eight weeks following the inception of the loan, it is forgiven. In the added guidance given by the SBA yesterday, they mention that “it is anticipated that not more than 25% of the forgiven amount may be for non-payroll costs.” For the PPP, you’ll need to apply for forgiveness with your lender that is servicing your loan.
Similarly, the $10,000 advance (which should be coming to those of you that applied on Monday pretty soon) is not required to be repaid, even if you’re denied additional funds. It’s a little ambiguous to me whether you’re required to use the funds to pay the above expenses (it says “may”). Currently, I'm relying on the interpretation of the US Chamber of Commerce. We will learn more as additional guidance comes out and the grants start getting disbursed, which will be soon."
"Alright, I’m in! Where do I apply?","The online application for EIDLs has been open since Monday. You can find it here. The feedback I’ve received so far is that it takes less than 30 minutes. You’ll need a profit and loss from January 31, 2019 – January 31, 2020. You’ll also need to unfreeze your credit report if you’ve frozen it. The SBA determines initial loan size based on your credit score, not your ability to pay.
You apply for the PPP through your local bank. Yesterday, the SBA offered a specific timeline for different applications.

Starting April 3, 2020, small businesses and sole proprietorships can apply for and receive loans to cover their payroll and other certain expenses through existing SBA lenders. Starting April 10, 2020, independent contractors and self-employed individuals can apply for and receive loans to cover their payroll and other certain expenses through existing SBA lenders. Other regulated lenders will be available to make these loans as soon as they are approved and enrolled in the program.

Just because your date isn’t here yet, it doesn’t mean you can’t start preparing for the process. You can find SBA lenders here. You can find the sample PPP application here."
I applied for EIDLs before the CARES Act went into effect. Should I apply again?,Yes. The SBA has specifically stated business owners looking for the grant need to apply through the new application that went up on Monday.
I heard EIDLs are based on credit and mine isn’t that great. Should I still apply?,"Yes! In a recent webinar, Alex Contreras, Director of Preparedness, Communication & Coordination at the Office of Disaster Assistance at the SBA said that they will try to be flexible and that even a bankruptcy doesn’t necessarily disqualify you. Additionally, there are no application, guarantee or prepayment fees, so there’s no harm in applying. Even if you don’t qualify for additional funds, you can still get the grant."
Is this really real? This seems like too much of a good thing.,"It’s definitely real. And it’s also a lot to juggle when you’re also dealing with a pandemic. I hope this helps. We will learn a lot more as things start to play out., so I’ll continue to update as we go along. I’d love to hear your success or challenges. You can message me at the links below."
How did it start?,"The virus is one of the few that can be transmitted from animals to humans. It is believed to have originated in bats, which perhaps infected live animals and seafood sold at a ""wet market"" in Wuhan, a crowded, not so sanitary dense marketplace. Bats are also hosts for Ebola, HIV, and rabies.

The first person who contracted the virus on December 1, 2019, had no connection to the outdoor market, making it unclear how he contracted it in the first place. 

Others who shopped there came down with viral pneumonia from Covid-19."
How does Coronavirus get transmitted?,Covid-19 can be passed from person to person through droplets from coughs and sneezes.
How to protect yourself from Covid-19,"As Covid-19 is spread through droplets, it can reach us through the air. Therefore, maintain social distancing, which means remaining 6 feet away from others.  Ideally, you shouldn't touch any surface on which droplets may have landed. The best way to protect yourself from exposed surfaces is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water for a count of 20. The children’s book Coronavirus You Can’t Scare Me teaches kids through pictures and rhyme:

I wash my hands throughout the day/ And count from one to twenty/ The palms, the backs, the fingernails/ With soap and water plenty.

Coronavirus You Can’t Scare Me written by the author
The best way to ensure you're doing all the above is to stay home if you can. Talk to your friends and family on the phone, social media, Skype or Zoom."
What exactly does it mean to flatten the curve?,"Flattening the curve refers to the rate at which people are getting infected. Without intervention, the number of individuals who contract Covid-19 rises exponentially, which means it doubles at a constant rate — in this case, every three days. At such a rate, the number of infected individuals will overwhelm our hospital system, because we simply don't have enough hospital beds and respirators to treat them all. The United States doesn't even have enough protective equipment at present to protect its own health care workers. 

Doing the math, if one person is infected with the virus on Jan 1, with the number of people infected people doubling every 3 days, then by March 31, over 1 billion people will have become infected. With the world population being around 7.8 billion, it would only take until April 9 for all of us to be infected.

The situation in Italy has shown us that, without enough equipment, hospitals will be compelled to turn away some of the most infirmed among us, resulting in increased fatalities.  

Staying home does not prevent you from contracting the virus down the line, but from contracting the virus and overwhelming the medical establishment now. Postponing exposure buys time for the scientific and medical community to develop effective treatments or a vaccine to minimize or protect against infection."
"I hear it is only dangerous in older people and those with compromised immune systems.
","According to the most recent report by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of hospitalizations and deaths were greatest among those between 65 - 74. Yet 20% of those hospitalized for severe symptoms of Covid-19 were between the ages of 20-44 years.  "
Who should get tested?,"Tests are limited and most state and local health authorities will tell you not to get tested, even if you have symptoms, unless:

You have symptoms and were recently in contact with someone who tested positive for Coronavirus.
You have symptoms and need to be hospitalized.
Cotton swabs and tests are in short supply, so if you do not fall into the above two categories, chances are your doctor will not order a test.  

Still, if you have symptoms, call your medical doctor to be advised on how to proceed. You most likely will be directed to self-quarantine for 14 days.

For all of us, stay safe, stay home, keep your distance, wash your hands often and thoroughly with soap and water, and cover your coughs and sneezes."
What happens to the coronavirus when it stops spreading? Does it disappear?,The coronavirus that is keeping us all at home started off in animals and then jumped to humans. Scientists say that when it stops spreading in humans it won’t totally disappear. It will still probably be around in animals.
What if the Corona virus gets to an old person who gives it to a 10-year-old. How strong will the virus be in the 10-year-old?,"The exact same virus affects different people in different ways. It can make an older person very sick and hardly get a 10-year-old sick at all. Researchers don’t know why that is yet, but they are working hard to find out."
Can the virus affect any other part of your body besides your lungs?,"Yes. The virus can also affect your nose and throat, your blood, and maybe your stomach and intestines too. In kids, the virus is most likely to affect your nose and throat."
"If you were infected with the virus, you had treatment and recovered. Can the virus return?","Doctors say it is unlikely that the coronavirus would make you sick twice, especially if your body does a good job fighting it the first time."
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?,"Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. 


 
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:


 
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. 



Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. 



Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. 



Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. 



Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. 


 
Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. 


 
Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas."
Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading,"Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for everyone)
Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses. 


If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.
Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses."
Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?,"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available."
What Is COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019."
How likely am I to catch COVID-19?,"The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.

For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go."
Should I wear a mask to protect myself?,"Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks.

The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing."
Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?,No. There is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
How Does COVID-19 Spread?,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings."
How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?,"The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available."
What Are The Symptoms Of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."
Is there anything I should not do?,"The following measures are not effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:

Smoking, 
wearing multiple masks,
taking antibiotics. 
In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider."
Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?,"No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different.

SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003."
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?,Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).

If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose."
Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed. 

To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."
Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?,"The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings."
What Is A Coronavirus?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19."
Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported?,"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low."
How long does the COVID-19 infection last?,"The infection period for the virus will vary from person to person. Mild symptoms in an otherwise healthy individual may resolve over just a few days. Similar to influenza, for an individual with other ongoing health issues, such as a respiratory condition, recovery may take weeks and in severe cases could be potentially fatal."
Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?,"The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating."
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?,"No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection."
"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?","Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.

Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19.

The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing."
"How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask?","Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.
Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water
Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.
Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).
Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).
Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.
Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.
After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.
Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.
Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water."
Should I worry about COVID-19?,"Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.

We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings."
Who is at risk of developing severe illness?,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others."
"And let's start with the trends here. Who's getting sick, and how sick are they getting?","Sure. Well, we do have a preliminary snapshot of cases in the U.S. from the CDC. And the picture so far is similar to what was documented in China. Coronavirus hits oldest people - older people the hardest. The CDC analysis found that about half of the people who've ended up in intensive care are 65 and older; the highest percentage of deaths in the U.S. has been among those 85 and older. Now this is based on an analysis of about 500 patients admitted to the hospital in the U.S. - so not all of the cases. But here's something to be aware of - younger adults can be vulnerable too; about 20% of people hospitalized were in their 40s and 50s. And this may come as a surprise - about 20% were younger. So some millennials and Gen Xers have gotten seriously ill."
Are those people who had some other underlying health problem?,"Well, that's important to understand, and we don't have a complete picture yet of which underlying medical problems were present in how many of these younger people. But it's worth noting - an analysis from Italy shows that about 99% of the people who've died in Italy from the virus had at least one underlying illness or condition such as heart disease, a history of stroke, diabetes. So these certainly seem to increase the risk of death or serious illness."
"Well, let's talk about treatments for people who would end up in the hospital with COVID-19. The president and Dr. Anthony Fauci had a kind of debate in a briefing last week about how near some kind of treatment drug might be. What is the latest here? What's actually available?","That's right. Well, the Milken Institute is tracking the development of a whole bunch of potential treatments and vaccines. They've identified literally dozens of different candidates in the works on both the vaccine side, the treatment side - over 40 different compounds being looked at for the vaccine. But a vaccine is definitely a ways off. I mean, 12 to 18 months is an optimistic estimate out there.

In regard to treatments, there are clinical trials underway to look at the safety, efficacy of different drugs, from antivirals to antibody treatments. With one candidate, an antiviral called Remdesivir, some early results are expected later this spring, and there's a lot of hope out there. But obviously it's important to see what the studies find."
What about simply testing people to see if they have the virus?,"Well, we know it's been a very bumpy start - right? - lots of stories of delays, backlogs, despite promises to expand quickly. Now, over the weekend, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for a new diagnostic tool. This can provide results within hours rather than days. The company says it's going to make this available - roll this out by March 30th, so end of next week. So this could speed up testing."
So how can I tell the difference between someone who just has allergies and somebody who has something worse?,"So there is some overlap. But there are key differences, too. I've spoken to a bunch of allergists about this. And here is one very important distinction - fever is a symptom of COVID-19, but it is not a symptom of seasonal allergies. With all of that pollen starting to develop around the country, a lot of people are sneezing and will have a runny nose. These are typical symptoms of seasonal allergies but not necessarily typical of coronavirus. Cough is another very important distinction. Coughing is usually not a main symptom of seasonal allergies, but it is a key symptom of COVID-19, especially a dry cough."
"People are also asking about re-infection, whether you are immune to this once you've had it.","Well, with a lot of viruses, I mean, after you've gotten exposed to it the first time, you'll have partial protection against it going forward. And there is reason to think that the same could be true with this virus. Now, the CDC says there's still a lot that is not known about the immune response to COVID-19. But for now, they're saying patients who have recovered from an infection are not likely to be re-infected shortly afterwards."
So when might things begin to get back to normal?,"Oh, gosh. Well, you know, we're halfway through that 15-day period announced last week asking everyone to hunker down, stay home. And what Anthony Fauci, the top adviser, has said over the weekend is that the social distancing, all the measures we're taking - they will have an effect. But we just can't quantify the effect yet. I mean, how much we may be slowing the spread here is masked by the significant increase in cases each day, as you just mentioned at the top.

So you know, as testing expands, we're going to get this increase in cases. Hard to see the progress here - it's likely going to be much, much longer before life feels like normal again, right? I mean, many schools have extended closures. There'll be lots of distance learning going on. Many scientists and public health experts watching China as the country lifts its restrictions. Does the virus stay under control, or does it start to spread again? We can learn a lot by watching what happens there."
We know the virus can live on hard surfaces. What about clothing?,"It probably can — but you shouldn't be overly worried. Here's why.
So far, there aren't scientific findings on how long the virus can live on fabric. But fabrics are generally porous — as is cardboard, which has been tested. And a recent study did find that the virus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours.
""The thing that you have to consider, though, is that those tests are done in ideal testing circumstances,"" says Rachel Graham, a virologist at the University of North Carolina. ""That's like in some kind of hermetically sealed box where there's no fluctuation in humidity, there's no wind, there's nothing that can contribute toward desiccating the virus. And so desiccation — or drying out the virus — would actually reduce the amount of time it's actually viable on any kind of surface.""
Plus, porousness is a good thing when it comes to avoiding viral transmission. A surface that is permeable, like a fabric, tends to trap viruses more easily than hard surfaces.
""It's less at risk of transmitting because the virus gets kind of stuck to the [porous] surface, and so it can't be easily transferred back off of it,"" Graham says. ""Porous surfaces also suck the fluid out of it. The viral membrane is a lipid membrane, and so if that becomes dried out, it's basically done, infectivity-wise.""
If you are concerned that clothing or other fabric items might have picked up the virus, throw the clothing in the washer and dryer. For most situations, says Graham, your detergent will do its job and get rid of any infective particles — or at least sanitize them to the point where they're not a risk to you.
If you're taking care of someone who is ill or immunocompromised or if you're working in a health care setting, you may want to take additional precautions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommendations for households with suspected or confirmed cases of the coronavirus, which include wearing gloves when handling dirty laundry from an ill person and using the warmest appropriate water setting when washing clothes or linens to disinfect them.
I like to use wipes to disinfect surfaces in my home — especially surfaces that are frequently touched. But how much surface area can one wipe be used on before it loses its ability to kill the coronavirus?
The first step is to check the label on the wipes you're using. For instance, the label on a container of Clorox wipes instructs: ""Use enough wipes for treated surface to remain visibly wet for 4 minutes. To kill viruses, let stand 15 seconds.""
That time and that visible wetness are important, says Erica Hartmann, an expert in environmental microbiology at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering.
Regardless of the particular ingredients in the wipes you're using, ""they're all chemicals that have to react,"" she says. ""And those chemical reactions aren't instantaneous — they take a certain amount of time. So what you're doing when you're keeping the surface wet is you're basically allowing time, allowing the chemical reactions to take place.""
So if that Clorox wipe isn't making the surface visibly wet for 4 minutes, you're trying to cover too much ground with one wipe.
There's no exact figure for how much surface area a wipe can handle. But a 2018 study found that one wipe is generally more effective over 1 to 2 square feet than 8 square feet.
And you don't need a premade wipe to clean surfaces: You can also use a liquid product on a cloth or paper towel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises using products that contain bleach (sodium hypochlorite) or alcohol (at least 70%) and following the manufacturer's directions. You can make your own cleaning solution by mixing 4 teaspoons of bleach per quart of water, according to the CDC.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has posted a list of approved products to disinfect against the coronavirus.
Strangers keep petting my dog when we go for a walk. Could my dog transmit the virus on its fur?
Saskia Popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist at the health care system HonorHealth, says she's not especially concerned about dog fur transmitting the virus. ""I think that I would probably be more worried if somebody was coughing all over the place and went to touch my dog's harness or something — something inanimate,"" she says. ""I would put it in the lower-risk category.""
That's because like fabric, fur is a porous surface — so it isn't easy for a person to pick up bits of virus from it. ""The chances of you getting it from fur and hair is going to be less than getting it from a solid surface,"" says Graham, the virologist. Still, she said, she would err on the side of caution and ask people not to pet your dog right now.
Graham says one way to make sure your dog doesn't get touched by overenthusiastic petters is to avoid letting your dog off leash in a place where it may encounter other people. Rather than going to a dog park, she says, ""it might be a better idea to take your dog out in the yard or somewhere you know that there's not going to be a lot of people.""
And despite the occasional media report of a dog diagnosed with COVID-19, there is no evidence that pets can contract or spread COVID-19. The CDC says it has not received any reports of pets or animals becoming sick with the disease. The American Veterinary Medical Association concurs: ""Infectious disease experts and multiple international and domestic human and animal health organizations agree there is no evidence at this point to indicate that pets become ill with COVID-19 or that they spread it to other animals, including people.""
One note: If you are already sick with COVID-19, the association recommends limiting contact with animals ""out of an abundance of caution"" until more is known about the virus. If you're not sick with the coronavirus, the group says you can interact with your pet as you normally would — while practicing good hygiene, including washing your hands before and after interacting with your pet."
Can you get COVID-19 more than once?,"The short answer: We don't know yet. It's not yet clear whether people can be reinfected by this coronavirus or how long immunity might last after infection.
Immunity after recovery from COVID-19 would be a boon in the global fight to rein in the virus. People who have recovered and gained immunity would be especially valuable as health care workers. The spread of the virus would slow if more people had immunity to it. And antibodies from recovered people could help in developing a treatment for the disease.
As NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has reported, scientists are looking for clues about immunity to and reinfection from other coronaviruses.
The severe coronaviruses SARS and MERS did produce antibodies in those who had the virus. In the case of MERS, survivors generated an immune response to the virus that could be detected up to two years later. And the sicker the patient was, the more long lasting their immune response.
But in the case of the four seasonal coronaviruses that are a cause of the common cold, they can sicken people over and over again. After infection with one of these viruses, antibodies are produced — but then the levels slowly decline and people become susceptible again.
There are some indications that the new coronavirus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, can spur immunity. New not-yet-peer-reviewed research in rhesus macaques found that the new coronavirus does not cause reinfections.
""I think there's a very likely scenario where the virus comes through this year, and everyone gets some level of immunity to it, and if it comes back again, we will be protected from it,"" Matt Frieman, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, told NPR. ""Either completely or if you do get reinfected later, a year from now, then you have much less disease.""
""That is the hope,"" he adds. ""But there is no way to know that."""
"I heard that the U.K. was talking about using a ""herd immunity"" approach to the coronavirus. What exactly is herd immunity, and could it work against coronavirus?","Last week, the U.K. government signaled that it might be considering a different approach to coronavirus control than the rest of the world — in essence, allowing a large percentage of the population to become infected in order to develop a ""herd immunity"" that would eventually end the epidemic.
Herd immunity occurs when enough people in a population are immune to disease — either because they've been infected and recovered or they've been vaccinated against it. The idea is that the pool of people who can catch the disease has been reduced, reducing the risk to the so-far unaffected.
Sir Patrick Vallance, the U.K. government's chief scientific adviser, said that about 60% of the population would need to get the coronavirus in order to get a herd immunity effect.
But using such an approach would raise a big question: During that spread, how do you protect the most vulnerable groups – the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions?
Herd immunity works with contagious diseases like measles, for which a vaccine exists. But the idea that the U.K. would not immediately work to suppress the number of cases, especially as there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 yet and the disease has killed thousands in Italy, stirred an immediate public backlash.
The government quickly backtracked, and on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all restaurants, pubs and gyms would close for the foreseeable future to reduce transmission.
And there is no certainty that herd immunity would even work for coronavirus. That approach ""assumes that people being infected are immune and cannot get re-infected. And we don't know that as of yet,"" says Albert Ko, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Yale School of Public Health.
People who go outside to exercise are sometimes shamed on TV and on social media for risky behavior. Is it okay to go outside for a walk, run or bike ride?
The White House coronavirus guidelines for the 15-day period that started Monday advise avoiding ""discretionary travel, shopping trips and social visits,"" as well as ""social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people."" But outdoor exercise is not on the list.
So unless local guidelines instruct otherwise, fresh air and outdoor exercise are allowed – though it's important to keep some distance between yourself and others. The coronavirus is thought to spread primarily through close contact between people – within about six feet.
The primary mode of transmission is through respiratory droplets.
There is better airflow outside than in confined spaces. That air flow outside reduces the risk of one person transmitting the virus to another through droplets in the air, says Albert Ko, the Yale epidemiologist. ""So if you're going out and you're hiking or biking or running and you're not within, say, six feet or 10 feet of another person, I would consider that a healthy, safe practice.""
Ko also points to the significant mental health issues that can be caused or exacerbated when people are cooped up.
""My personal feeling is that if people are practicing sound respiratory hygiene, sound hand hygiene, they're distancing themselves physically from others outside, and you're exercising and walking in the park — I think that's actually a good public health practice."""
I've heard that taking drugs like ibuprofen to ease COVID-19 symptoms could actually worsen the progress of the illness. Is that true?,"The World Health Organization and many infectious disease experts say that there is no good scientific evidence establishing a link between ibuprofen and worsening of COVID‑19.
The notion that such a link exists was sparked last weekend when a tweet by the French health minister warned people not to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — a category of pain relievers and fever reducers that includes ibuprofen — because, he said, some French COVID-19 patients had experienced serious side effects. The warning was also included in a bulletin from the French health ministry, which counseled that patients should instead use acetaminophen, the generic name for Tylenol.
But experts say that warning isn't based on data.
""Based on currently available information, WHO does not recommend against the use of ibuprofen,"" the WHO stated on its official Twitter account, adding, ""'We are also consulting with physicians treating COVID-19 patients and are not aware of reports of any negative effects of ibuprofen, beyond the usual known side effects that limit its use in certain populations.""
Dr. Angela Rogers, a pulmonologist at the Stanford University Medical Center and chair of its intensive care unit's COVID-19 task force, notes that Tylenol is the go-to medication for patients who are sick enough to be hospitalized for any infection. That's because these patients are at higher risk of damage to internal organs, including kidneys. And kidney damage can be a side effect of ibuprofen for some patients who use it long-term in higher doses, says Rogers, whose research focuses on the kind of acute respiratory distress experienced by the most severe COVID-19 cases.
Tylenol, like any medicine, isn't risk-free either; Rogers notes that acetaminophen can cause serious liver damage in high doses. In low doses, though, she says, Tylenol is ""very effective"" for reducing fever and ""very safe."""
How do I manage any risks while grocery shopping?,"With new research that suggests the new coronavirus can live on surfaces for hours or days, the prospect of going grocery shopping can seem daunting.
But you can manage the risk.
First of all, the viability of the virus goes down over time and it's sensitive to temperature – so it dies off more quickly in room temperature than it does in the cold.
Second, when you go to a grocery store, people aren't generally touching all the cans on the shelf — although there tends to be more handling of individual items in the produce section.
Among the things you can do to protect yourself and others are:
Ko says it helps to understand the differing levels of risk in different situations. Coming into close contact with a person who is infected with coronavirus carries greater risk than touching a shopping cart that might have been touched by an infected person hours or days earlier.
When it comes to disinfecting things, it makes sense to focus on high-touch surfaces. Ko says you should worry more about disinfecting bathroom doorknobs and faucets at home than about a can of tomato soup from the supermarket.
""There's never anything that has zero risk,"" Ko says, ""but the risk is so much lower than [surfaces] that are more frequently touched."""
Can face coverings prevent the spread of the virus?,"The primary benefit of covering your nose and mouth is that you protect others. While there is still much to be learned about the novel coronavirus, it appears that many people who are infected are shedding the virus – through coughs, sneezes and other respiratory droplets – for 48 hours before they start feeling sick. And others who have the virus – up to 25%, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield — may never feel symptoms but may still play a role in transmitting it.
That's why wearing a mask even if you don't feel sick can be a good idea.
If you cough or sneeze, the mask can catch those respiratory droplets so they don't land on other people or surfaces. ""So it's not going to protect you, but it is going to protect your neighbor,"" says Dr. Daniel Griffin at Columbia University, an expert on infectious diseases. ""If your neighbor is wearing a mask and the same thing happens, they're going to protect you. So masks worn properly have the potential to benefit people.""
The best masks are N95 respirators, but the general public is urged not to use them because they are fiercely needed by health care workers right now. If you have those, consider donating them immediately to a local hospital or find a drop-off here. Same goes for surgical masks — those thin blue models-- which offer less protection but are helpful and are also in short supply."
"If I'm wearing a mask and someone sneezes on me, would the mask offer some protection?","Yes. But only if you use the mask properly and don't touch it with your hands afterward.
Those droplets from a cough or sneeze would hit your mask instead of your mouth and nose — good news. But the next step is to take the mask off by the ear bands and either wash or discard it — without touching the front of it.
""That's what I see all the time,"" says Griffin. ""That's why in the studies, masks fail — people don't use them [correctly]. They touch the front of it. They adjust it. They push it down somehow to get their nose stuck out.""
If you touch the front of the mask, whatever that person coughed or sneezed on it is now on your hands.
As this video from the World Health Organization shows, you should take off your mask by removing the elastics or straps from behind your ears. Don't touch the front, and keep the mask away from your face.
One other thing: Ideally you would have eye protection, too, to keep that stranger's sneeze from getting in. Glasses and sunglasses aren't perfect but can help."
What about homemade masks?,"As NPR has previously reported, some research has shown that cotton T-shirt material and tea towels might help block respiratory droplets emitting from sick people — though it's not clear how much protection they provide.
Another study, of health care workers in Vietnam, found that use of cloth masks resulted in greater infection than either those wearing surgical masks or a control group, some of whom also wore surgical masks.
We don't yet know exactly how effective homemade masks are, but Griffin thinks they're a good idea — he has even taken to wearing one over his N95 respirator."
How often do I need to wash it?,"Griffin says to think of a mask as like underwear: It needs to be washed after each use.
""You don't take this dirty mask off, put it in your purse and then stick it back on your face,"" he says. ""It's something that once you put on, is potentially either touching your coughs, sneezes or the spray of your speech, or protecting you from the coughs, spray, speech of other people. And now it's dirty. It needs to basically be either discarded or washed.""
So if you're wearing a cloth mask, put it into the laundry basket immediately. If it's disposable, throw it away.
It's a big no-no to pull the mask down to eat a snack, then pull it back up: You've just gotten whatever dirty stuff is on the mask on your hands and into your mouth."
Is there one best mask design?,"There is little data so far on cloth or homemade masks in general — let alone data that dictates how many pleats to put on your home-sewn version.
Griffin says the best material to use is a tight-weave cotton. ""Don't use a synthetic or a polyester because they've looked at the virus's ability to survive on surfaces, and spandex is the worst,"" he says.
Johns Hopkins Medicine has one design you might try. Kaiser Permanente has another design, as well as a video showing how to make a mask using a sewing machine. Both recommend 100% woven cotton fabric. Kaiser recommends washing and drying the fabric two or three times before cutting it, so it doesn't shrink later.
You can make a mask out of a T-shirt, no sewing machine required. You could also try making one out of (unused) shop towels. But no matter what you make it out of, try to make it fit closely to your face and don't touch the front of it once you've started wearing it."
Would a scarf work?,"Probably not as well as a mask that fits closely to your face.
""You can imagine if you put a loosely knit scarf with lots of holes in it ... that would not be very effective,"" says Dr. Michael Klompas, an infectious disease physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
The goal is to create a barrier that catches droplets and keeps others from coming in, so you want coverage that is tightly woven and close-fitting."
Can I donate masks to hospitals?,"After you get a handle on making masks, you could keep going – and donate the additional masks to health care centers. Johns Hopkins University, for instance, is accepting donated masks for nonpatient care settings. It asks that masks not be made in a solid color, especially blue or white, which could be confused with medical-grade masks."
Do masks confer any other benefits?,"Masks can also function as an important visual cue, says Joseph Allen, an assistant professor of exposure and assessment science at Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
They're a ""reminder that we need to be taking these precautions and serve as a reminder to people to keep that 6-foot buffer,"" he says. ""It should be seen as a badge of honor. If I'm wearing a mask out in public, it means I'm concerned about you, I'm concerned about my neighbors, I'm concerned about strangers on the chance that I'm infectious. I want to do my part in limiting how I might impact you.""
Klompas agrees — and says that it can also give the wearer a welcome sense of security.
""It feels like you're behind a shield,"" he says, ""and I think that in itself can be reassuring.""
And for the others around you, it's a warning. ""It says: Watch out. There's a public health crisis right now, there's a virus going around, we need to be on top guard,"" says Klompas. ""I think it can actually be a reinforcer, a reminder of the state of crisis that we face in society.""
But he says that masks are not a replacement for all the other steps we need to take right now to protect ourselves from the coronavirus — especially social distancing and good hand hygiene."
When will this end?,"This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on[ ](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/20/us/coronavirus-model-us- outbreak.html)[how well the virus is contained](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/20/us/coronavirus- model-us-outbreak.html).

In the United States, forecasts differ depending on where you live. New York City, Seattle, Boston and parts of California already have such large outbreaks that they will probably see significant growth even after taking extraordinary preventive measures, according to Columbia University researchers who used a New York Times [database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us- cases.html) and Census Bureau data to model outcomes.  Some experts have[ ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/health/coronavirus- shut-down.html)[guessed, optimistically,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/health/coronavirus-shut- down.html) that the virus could abate in about two months, although that does not mean that public life would go back to normal. The more we take early precautions to protect our communities, like practicing social distancing, the better the results will be.  If measures to slow the disease aren’t effective, the virus could sicken millions of people, losing steam on the coasts in May before spreading to the rest of the country over the summer.

How can I help?,"[Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=7779), which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the [American Red Cross](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate- blood/dlp/coronavirus--covid-19--and-blood-donation.html), and [World Central Kitchen](https://wck.org/) has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30,000 coronavirus-related [GoFundMe fund- raisers](https://www.gofundme.com/c/act/covid19) have started in the past few weeks.

How can I get help?,"This is a fast-moving crisis, and the social, medical and economic fallout is going to affect millions of people for months to come.  There are many places you can go for help, whether you need relief from bills or are worried about becoming sick.  There’s a lot of information below about specific situations. Here’s a quick guide to some of the big ones that might be on your mind."
Help me understand the economic fallout.,"It’s felt a lot like 2008, hasn’t it? Peter S. Goodman, an economics correspondent for The Times, says there’s a key difference between that economic turmoil and today’s: the utter unpredictability of the outbreak’s spread. “The disaster feels eerily familiar, with trillions of dollars in wealth annihilated near-daily and deepening fears that businesses will fail,” [he writes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/business/coronavirus-global- economy.html). “Yet the traditional policy prescriptions seem no match for the affliction at hand.”  The very means of controlling the health crisis — keeping workers home, limiting travel and disrupting commerce — risk making the economic crisis worse.  “A sense of powerlessness is feeding the fear that is prompting investors to dump anything risky, which is in turn damaging economic prospects and reinforcing fear — a feedback loop,” he writes."
I heard that Americans were getting checks. What’s that about?,"__ With the $2 trillion stimulus legislation passed by Congress on March 27, federal lawmakers agreed to provide $1,200 in direct payments to millions of Americans. How much you receive [depends on your income.](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package- questions-answers.html) Single adults with Social Security numbers who have an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less will get the full amount of $1,200. Married couples with no children earning $150,000 or less will receive a total of $2,400. And taxpayers filing as head of household will get the full payment if they earned $112,500 or less. For every qualifying child age 16 or under, the payment will be an additional $500.  If you earn above these income figures, the payment decreases until it stops completely for single people earning $99,000 or married people who have no children and earn $198,000. According to the Senate Finance Committee, a family with two children will no longer be eligible for any payments if their income is above $218,000. In any given family and in most instances, everyone must have a valid Social Security number in order to be eligible."
"I’m a college student, will I get anything?","__ If you’re listed as a dependent on a tax return, then no. Students under age 24 are often dependents in the eyes of the taxing authorities if a parent pays for at least half of their expenses."
Do I have to apply to receive a payment?,"__ No. If you qualify, the Internal Revenue Service already has your bank account information, it will transfer the money to you via direct deposit based on the recent income-tax figures it already has. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin [said](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/world/coronavirus- news-live.html#link-6b422738) he expected most people to get their payments in April."
How does unemployment insurance work?,"__ The [stimulus plan](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/politics/whats- in-coronavirus-stimulus-bill.html) includes a significant expansion of unemployment benefits that would extend jobless insurance by 13 weeks. The program is aimed to help freelancers, part-time workers, furloughed employees and gig workers, such as Uber drivers, as well as full-time employees who have lost their jobs.  States have set their own rules for eligibility and benefits, which are generally calculated as a percentage of your income over the past year, up to a certain maximum. Some states are more generous than others, but unemployment typically replaces about 45 percent of your lost income. Under the plan, eligible workers would get an extra $600 per week on top of their state benefit.  One important note: You might not have to lose your job to qualify. If you’re quarantined or have been furloughed — and you’re not being paid but expect to return to your job eventually — you may be able to get unemployment benefits."
I’m having trouble paying my bills. What can I do?,"__**Student loans** The Department of Education has granted a payment waiver of at least 60 days to many people. But it’s not necessarily automatic. In general, you have to call your loan servicer to request a waiver and to make sure that your loan is eligible. The waiver does not apply to private student loans. One big private lender, Sallie Mae, said it is offering suspension of payment for up to three months, with no damage to a borrower’s credit.  With the stimulus package, there will be [automatic payment suspensions for any student loan](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus- package-questions-answers.html) held by the federal government until Sept. 30. It may be hard to contact many of the loan servicers right now, so check your account online in the coming weeks.  **Utility bills** Some utility providers are offering to stop cutting people off for nonpayment. A number of large internet companies have agreed not to terminate residential or small-business customers who can’t pay their bills. Exact policies and requirements vary, though, so if you need help, you should call and ask.  **Housing** There’s also a good chance you can delay your mortgage payment if the outbreak has left you short of money. The Federal Housing Finance Agency has instructed mortgage servicers to allow borrowers whose mortgages are owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to delay payments. If you rent, the best national resource we’ve found so far is the search-by-state function on [Justshelter.org](https://justshelter.org/community-resources/). This offers information on local organizations that can provide advice to renters in distress.  **Loans and credit** Many consumer lenders are offering affected customers help if they can’t make payments. The American Bankers Association has a list of lenders here, although the help they’re offering varies. Some say they will allow borrowers to skip payments; some are offering other accommodations."
I don’t have health insurance. What can I do?,"__ If you lost your job (and with it your health insurance), or even if you never signed up for a policy, you may have options. Some states and employers have loosened the rules around when you can sign up for insurance because of the pandemic.  There’s also the possibility of continuing your job-based coverage under a law known as the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, or COBRA; applying for Medicaid with your state agency; or getting an individual plan at Healthcare.gov. [It depends on your circumstances](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/upshot/coronavirus-health- insurance-faq.html) which route makes sense."
What should I do with my 401(k)?,"__ Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions —[don’t](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/business/coronavirus-401k-contributions.html)! In fact, if your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.”  Many components of the stimulus package, passed on March 27, include changes to rules regarding retirement account withdrawals, borrowing and penalties."
Should I be putting my money in a mattress?,"That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But you may want to think about having enough cash[ to cover basic needs](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-advice.html) if you’re retired. One financial planner recommended that retirees set aside enough cash for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years."
Should I refinance my mortgage?,"It could be a good idea, but lenders are overwhelmed right now, so expect the process of shopping and closing to take time. When mortgage rates fall to record lows, as we’ve seen in recent weeks, refinancing can be a good way to save some extra cash or [to shorten your loan term](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/business/mortgage-refinance- delays.html) and pay it off faster. If you shorten your loan term to 15 years from 30 years, your monthly payments are likely to rise, but you’ll have more flexibility in your budget sooner than you would’ve had."
What do I do about my taxes?,"The United States has moved the federal tax-filing deadline to July 15, giving Americans an additional three months to file their income tax returns.  Some states are also making changes. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants is tracking those [on its website](https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/advocacy/tax/downloadabledocuments/coronavirus- state-filing-relief.pdf)."
Will I be paid if I’m told to stay home?,"A coronavirus emergency relief package, passed by Congress in mid-March, gives qualified workers [two weeks of paid sick leave](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/upshot/coronavirus-paid-leave- guide.html) if they are ill, quarantined or seeking a diagnosis or preventive care for the coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus.  Many workers at small and midsize companies and nonprofits can get the paid leave, as can government employees, as long as they’ve been employed at least 30 days. The law includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. But it excludes those at companies with more than 500 people, including many front-line employees at many major retailers and fast-food restaurants.  Workers at places with fewer than 50 employees are included, but the Labor Department could exempt small businesses if providing leave would put them out of business. Employers can also decline to give leave to workers on the front lines of the crisis: health care providers and emergency responders."
How worried should I be about getting sick?,"Everyone should be concerned about contracting the new coronavirus — if not for yourself, then to protect others who are at risk of becoming severely ill. As with the flu, the virus is more dangerous for people who are older than 60, people who have a weakened immune system, and people with an underlying condition, like diabetes, asthma or another chronic illness."
What are the symptoms of the coronavirus?,"Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. Some people have also reported [losing their sense of smell](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell- taste.html).  Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days."
How do I take my temperature?,"Taking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.  If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications."
What should I do if I feel sick?,"If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that if you’re sick or think you’re sick, but only mildly ill, you should[ isolate yourself](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when- sick.html), and you shouldn’t leave your house except to go to the doctor."
How do I know when it’s bad enough to get help?,"With so much advice telling people to stay home, it can be hard to know when emergency treatment is necessary. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said these symptoms should prompt you to seek emergency care.  • Difficulty breathing  • Persistent pain or pressure in the chest  • Confusion or inability to arouse  • Bluish lips or face  • Any other symptom that is severe or concerning"
What if somebody in my family gets sick?,"If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to [guidelines issued by the C.D.C. in February.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent- spread.html) If there’s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom to minimize contact with healthy family members. Any shared spaces should have good airflow, such as an open window or an air conditioner, and you shouldn’t allow any visitors except for those who need to be in the house. Your family member should wear a face mask when he or she is around others, and if he or she can’t because of difficulty breathing, you should wear a mask.  Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items with your sick family member and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently."
Why can’t I just go to the doctor or the emergency room?,"“If you show up unnecessarily, you’re taking care away from people who really need it,” [writes Tara Parker- Pope](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/well/what-if-i-have- coronavirus.html), columnist for Well, The Times’s consumer health section. “Before going to the E.R., stop and ask yourself, ‘Would I go to the E.R. for these symptoms (a cough or fever) under normal circumstances?’ In most cases, the answer is probably no.”  Instead, you should call ahead and ask a doctor or the emergency room for advice. They’re likely to have the most up-to-date information for potential patients in your area, and they’ll tell you what to do next."
How do I get tested?,"If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the [C.D.C. recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms- testing/testing.html) that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested.  But keep in mind that, [across the country, sick people say they’re not being tested](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/us/coronavirus-testing- challenges.html). The obstacles range from a lack of testing kits to being rejected because you’re asymptomatic.  In other words: There’s a chance you can’t get tested, even if you think you need it."
Why do we need to stay six feet away? What’s magic about that number?,"The coronavirus spreads primarily by droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. While [a recent study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852) suggested that gaseous clouds could travel up to 27 feet, six feet is the approximate range of larger droplets that are more likely to be infectious and is the [distance recommended by the C.D.C](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how- covid- spreads.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Ftransmission.html).  Our understanding about this strain of the coronavirus is constantly evolving, though. The [World Health Organization advises](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel- coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) at least 3 feet of distance."
Is there a vaccine yet?,"Not yet. But in mid-March, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/health/coronavirus- vaccine.html) it was beginning the first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, and it was possible because researchers were able to use what they already knew about related coronaviruses that had caused other outbreaks, of SARS and MERS.  Other companies, using different approaches, are also trying to manufacture coronavirus vaccines. But it’s not certain they’ll work yet.  And despite the rapid progress, even if the vaccine is proved safe and effective against the virus, it will not be available for at least a year."
"I had the coronavirus, or probably did, and I feel fine now. Can I go about my life?",[The latest C.D.C. advice](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home- patients.html#st1) for people with Covid-19 who had symptoms is that they no longer need to self-isolate when:  • they have had no fever for at least a full 72 hours without the use of medicine and  • other symptoms have gotten better and  • at least seven days have passed since their symptoms first started.  But the guidance on this is changing all the time as we learn more.
Can you get the virus from eating food made by someone who was sick?,"Probably not. For cooked food, heat likely inactivates the virus, though there hasn’t been a study looking at the specific temperatures and conditions.  Of course there’s the concern that your delivery person[ ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-delivery- workers.html)[who can't afford to stay home](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-delivery- workers.html) has just touched the containers, so you should always wash your hands before eating."
Are people who get sick immune from the virus?,"The answer is a qualified yes, but there’s a lot that isn’t known yet.  If people who survived Covid-19 were known to be immune to the virus, they could venture back outside, and into the workforce, until a vaccine became available for everyone else. In particular, health care workers who are known to be immune could continue to care for severely ill people.  The quickest way to assess immunity to the coronavirus is a test that looks for protective antibodies in the blood of people who have recovered. But first you have to have the test.  Labs around the world are working on such tests, but none are readily accessible quite yet."
Should I wear a mask?,"The C.D.C.[ ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/health/masks-coronavirus- cdc.html)[recommends](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/health/masks- coronavirus-cdc.html) that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This shift in federal guidance, announced by President Trump at a White House briefing, reflects[ ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic- transmission.html)[new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic- transmission.html).  Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply.  The New York Times and other news outlets had been reporting the C.D.C.’s previous guidance.  Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing."
Are gloves a good way to protect myself?,"Gloves become a second skin. They themselves could become contaminated (don’t touch your face!) and depending on how they’re made, they might have holes. While gloves may be helpful if someone in your household becomes sick, reducing the amount of times you have to wash your hands, the most effective intervention is just washing your hands."
How is it different from the flu?,"The flu and the coronavirus can cause similar symptoms — a whole-body malaise, with a fever, a dry cough and a noticeable shortness of breath — but[ ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/coronavirus-flu.html)[there are differences](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/coronavirus-flu.html). Because the symptoms are so similar, doctors will sometimes rule out the flu first.  Spring allergy season tends to trigger many of the same symptoms in many people, adding another diagnostic wrinkle."
Is there a natural cure for the coronavirus?,"There is no proven cure for the coronavirus. But that has not stopped people (and some businesses) from claiming to have found one.  Despite what you may have read online: Gargling with warm water will not keep you from getting the coronavirus. Neither will elderberry syrup or colloidal silver. Essential oils are not a good substitute for hand sanitizer.  The authorities are cracking down on those seeking to capitalize on peoples’ fears and anxieties right now. The F.D.A. [sent warning letters](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/health/fda-letter-coronavirus- cures.html) to at least seven companies telling them to stop advertising fraudulent cures and treatments. The New York State attorney general ordered Alex Jones, the conservative radio host, to stop claiming that his diet supplements and toothpaste could be used [to fight the coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/nyregion/alex-jones- coronavirus-cure.html)."
Will the warmer weather stop the spread?,"Scientists are still looking into this.[ ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/health/warm-weather- coronavirus.html)[Some studies](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/health/warm-weather- coronavirus.html) __ suggest that warmer places account for a smaller share of global cases and have had slower infection rates. But none of these findings have been peer-reviewed yet. And even if a certain temperature and humidity diminished the spread, that wouldn’t preclude the virus’ return when the weather cools again.  We are providing free access to the most important news and useful guidance on the coronavirus outbreak to help you understand the pandemic. Get the [latest news and more information here](https://www.nytimes.com/news- event/coronavirus)."
What can I do to ease my anxiety about this?,"Some of the most important [measures you can take to help manage anxiety](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/smarter-living/coronavirus- anxiety-tips.html), experts say, include staying informed on the facts, asking for help and practicing self-compassion. For some people, anxiety manifests in feeling helpless or underreacting to what they’re experiencing. Recognize your own agency and start taking care of the common-sense precautionary measures that are within your control, like stocking up on a [couple of extra weeks’ supply](https://www.ready.gov/pandemic) of food or medication.  Maintaining social connection, despite physical distance, is also important. Reach out to others via phone calls, emails or video chats, and talk through the feelings you’re experiencing. It’s important to be gentle with yourself, and maintain any kind of routine you can to have a sense of stability. Practice self-care, whether that means doing an at-home workout, baking, maintaining a regular religious practice or journaling. Focusing on these things can help bring some peace of mind. If your anxiety is debilitating, seek out a mental health professional or other clinical mental health services."
I’m having trouble sleeping. Any tips?,"While there’s no single trick that works for everyone, one thing you can [try now to improve your sleep](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/style/self- care/sleep-tips-benefits-coronavirus.html) is setting up a consistent schedule. That means sticking to a regular bedtime and wake time. Try to go 90 minutes without any screen time before bed -- that means no emails, social media or watching T.V. You can also take baby steps, beginning with 15 minutes, then working your way up.  Working out, whether that means taking a socially distant walk or doing an at- home routine, can also help tire you out and dispel extra nervous energy. Taking a warm shower or bath 90 minutes before lights out may also help prime you for a better night’s sleep. Be sure to nix the coffee, alcohol and any eating before bed -- these things don’t promote quality rest. Finally, [manage your anxiety](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/style/self-care/sleep-tips- benefits-coronavirus.html) through meditation, deep breathing techniques and, in some cases, medication. If your anxiety is debilitating, seek out a mental health professional or other clinical mental health services."
How can I deal with grief during this time?,"One of the most important [things you can do to help manage your grief](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/well/family/coronavirus-grief- loss.html) includes acknowledging it in the first place. “The more we can say to ourselves and the people around us, ‘Yes, these are meaningful losses,’ the more seen and soothed we will feel,” Lori Gottlieb, a therapist and author, recently wrote in The Times.  Ms. Gottlieb recommends staying in the present as much as possible, versus thinking about the future or ruminating on things that haven’t happened yet. Try the [“both/and”](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/a-therapists- guide-to-emotional-health-in-a-pandemic/608161/) method: Let yourself feel your loss in the present while simultaneously promoting feelings of safety by taking actions like reading a book or video-chatting a friend. And realize that there’s no one-size-fits-all for grief -- everyone expresses it differently. Let yourself do whatever makes you feel best, whether that’s taking some alone time in your room or stress-cooking."
"How can I better take care of myself at home, aside from cleaning?","Having a [conversation with everyone in your household](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/smarter-living/how-you-can-make- your-home-safer.html), particularly children, about what’s going on is a good idea to help manage stress and keep everyone at home on the same page. Maintaining your mental fitness, in addition to physical fitness, is also important. Read a book, play a game, call a friend or just otherwise give yourself a break from the news to take care of your emotional and mental health.  Open your windows to let in some fresh air. To [improve your indoor air quality](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/climate/climate-pollution- coronavirus-lungs.html), turn on the ventilation hood above your stove and open windows when cooking, if you can. If you smoke or vape, you should try to quit, or at the very least limit second hand smoke in the house by stepping outside (while maintaining social distance). And if you can afford an air purifier, it might be a good investment as well."
My eating habits have drastically changed. How can I better manage them?,"Of course, eating too much or too little in the short term is not a huge cause of concern for someone who is healthy, [experts said](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/well/how-to-manage-stress-eating-or- not-eating.html). But in the long term, moderation is important. Your body’s physical stress response may affect what kinds of foods you are reaching for, drawing you more toward carbohydrates and foods that are high in fat. Take stock of how any stress and anxiety may have affected your eating habits.  If you think you’re snacking too much when you’re not hungry, it may help to allow some time to pass and distract yourself with another activity before grabbing more food. Try to add some healthy snacks like fruits and vegetables into your routine, if you can.  If you’re regularly not eating enough, find something you can tolerate eating, or drink a calorie-rich beverage, like a protein shake. If you’re forgetting to eat entirely, schedule your mealtimes into your calendar and treat meals like any other essential appointment. You can also set alarms as a reminder to drink some water, or eat something."
Can I give blood?,"You can. Donor blood is not being used to treat coronavirus patients, but transfusions are still needed for cases like organ transplants or complications of childbirth.  But thousands of community blood drives have been canceled, cutting short a crucial supply.  The American Red Cross is still collecting donations at blood banks, which have enacted new safety measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Those measures include checking the temperatures of staff members and donors before they enter a drive facility, providing hand sanitizer for use before and during the donation process, enhancing their disinfection of surfaces and equipment, and spacing beds — when possible — to enable social distancing between donors.  And even if you’re under a stay-at-home order, donating blood is an essential need, so public health officials have made an exception for your trip to the donation center.  To find a donation center, check the American Association of Blood Banks [locator](http://www.aabb.org/tm/donation/Pages/Blood-Bank-Locator.aspx), visit the Red Cross [website](https://www.redcrossblood.org/) or call 1-800-RED-CROSS."
Where can I donate?,"[Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=7779), which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. More than 20,000 coronavirus-related [GoFundMe fund- raisers](https://www.gofundme.com/c/act/covid19) have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers [means more of them are likely to fail](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/style/gofundme-coronavirus.html) to meet their goal, though.)"
Want to give toward medical supplies?,"[Relief International](https://www.ri.org/donate/), which operates in 16 countries throughout Africa, the Middle East and Asia, has focused some of its efforts on helping Iran, where more than 20,000 infections and at least 1,500 deaths have been reported.  [Heart to Heart International](https://www.hearttoheart.org/covid-19-update/) is distributing urgently needed equipment and medication to its partners around the world. Medical supplies are also being delivered to providers on the front lines."
Want to simply give money?,"[GlobalGiving](https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/coronavirus-relief-fund/) is a large global crowdfunding community that connects nonprofits, donors and companies. It has set a goal of reaching $5 million in donations. Money received will go toward sending emergency medical workers to communities in need, providing medical supplies to hospitals and helping deliver essentials to families."
I have a sewing machine. Should I make masks?,"The C.D.C.[ ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/health/masks-coronavirus- cdc.html)[recommends](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/health/masks- coronavirus-cdc.html) that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This shift in federal guidance, announced by President Trump at a White House briefing, reflects[ ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic- transmission.html)[new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic- transmission.html).  Those who are sick with the coronavirus [can help limit the spread](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/health/us-coronavirus-face- masks.html) of respiratory droplets by wearing a mask, and that applies to those who are asymptomatic or undiagnosed as well. Plus, some organizations are using fabric masks as a temporary stopgap (civilians should not use [medical-grade masks](https://www.nytimes.com/article/face-masks- coronavirus.html), which are in short supply and must be reserved for health care workers on the front line). The Sewing and Craft Alliance is continuously updating a list of [health care facilities](https://www.weneedmasks.org/list/) that have asked for fabric mask donations.  The New York Times and other news outlets had been reporting the C.D.C.’s previous guidance."
I have older neighbors. How can I help them?,"Older people seem to be particularly susceptible to contracting the coronavirus, according to health officials. Some are staying at home and, as a precaution, may not open their doors to visitors.  One way to check on homebound older residents without jeopardizing their health is to call or send a text, [said Eric. S. Goldstein](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-help- volunteer.html), the chief executive officer of the UJA-Federation of New York, which provides food, health care and other services to people in need.  If telephone calls and texts are not an option, “talk through the door,” Mr. Goldstein said. Because some people may recoil at the suggestion that they are not self-sufficient, Mr. Goldstein suggested offering to help in a low-key way, such as saying, “I’m running to the market, can I get you anything?”"
What does ‘stay at home’ mean?,"Authorities in different states have used different phrases while asking people to stay home.  Generally, it means you should limit trips outside except for essential needs. You can still go for walks and exercise, but do it in a way that keeps you several feet away from other people. You can still go to the grocery store, but try to go once a week instead of more frequently. And wash your hands when you come back inside."
I’m stuck inside. Help?,"Stay home to [flatten the curve](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve- mitigation-infection.html), and don’t lose your mind by doing different activities like working your way through the [best 50 movies on Netflix right now](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/arts/television/best-movies-on- netflix.html), or by checking out the books on the nightstand you’ve been ignoring.

Be sure to get up and stretch, because [exercise](https://www.nytimes.com/guides/well/how-to-build-muscle) can help burn off pent up energy. Here’s a [quick guide to an at-home workout](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/204-strength-home- workout-1/ac351695049524bfb879/optimized/full.pdf) where the only equipment you need is a resistance band. While you’re moving, spend some time disinfecting surfaces in your home to keep everything clean. The C.D.C. [recommends you clean and disinfect](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html) high-contact surfaces, including tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets and sinks every day.  And check in with your loved ones. Social distancing doesn’t mean disconnecting from those you care about, and older relatives and friends are susceptible to loneliness, which researchers have found [comes with its own set of health hazard](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/health/lonliness- aging-health-effects.html)s. So make sure to FaceTime your parents and grandparents.  And if you have done all of those things, [watch this video](https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1239383795205169152) of Arnold Schwarzenegger feeding a pony and a donkey in his kitchen."
Can I make my home safer?,"So, you’re at home, like millions of other Americans. There are some simple practices there that you can follow to help reduce the risk of being exposed to or spreading the virus. Always remember the basics, like washing your hands frequently (and reminding members of your household to do so) and having two weeks worth of meals and any other essentials.  But don’t forget about cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces daily; that includes the interior of your vehicle, like the steering wheel. And when doing laundry, use the warmest appropriate setting and dry items fully."
Is it ethical to order delivery in a pandemic?,"It’s a complicated question, right? Officials are telling us to stay indoors and away from others. At the same time, you need food or, as importantly, medicine. But what about the health of the delivery workers who come to your door? How do we keep each other safe?  For [older Americans](https://www.cdc.gov/aging/emergency/pdf/SIP-pan-flu- injects.pdf) and those with health problems who are most at risk if they contract the coronavirus, having goods delivered makes sense. Some companies, [like Postmates](https://blog.postmates.com/introducing-non-contact- deliveries-ac2f23462909) and [Instacart](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-instacart-delivers- groceries-without-human-contact-2020-3), have begun offering non-contact or curbside deliveries. [European companies](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/12/europes-deliveroo-and-glovo- switch-on-contactless-delivery-during-covid-19-pandemic/) are doing it, too.  Those services have a large network in place, though, which means their businesses are likely to thrive. Smaller retailers will not as Americans eschew restaurants, bars and specialty stores. That is why some restaurants are promoting delivery services as a way to stay in business, and why some cities that have ordered restaurants and bars to close have made exceptions for places providing delivery and takeout.  But what about delivery workers? Some groups, like Gig Workers Rising, are demanding that employers like Doordash and Instacart do more to protect them on the job. Recently, the group started [a petition](https://www.coworker.org/petitions/demand-gig-economy-companies- give-paid-sick-time-off-during-coronavirus) asking companies to provide paid time off to drivers who become sick during the coronavirus outbreak and cannot work.  The bottom line is this: Online deliveries are a boon for those who cannot leave their homes, as well as small restaurants who fear going out of business. But at the same time it comes with a risk to drivers and delivery workers who fear the loss of income if they get sick. At a minimum, everyone should generously tip their drivers for the service."
How do I make working at home easier? __,"It’s a tough one. The writer Jen A. Miller [offers these tips](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/smarter-living/how-to-work-from-home- if-youve-never-done-it-before.html): Keep the same schedule, schedule breaks and proactively stay in touch with others to avoid suffering from isolation. That could mean emailing colleagues more often or holding video conferences to keep in touch. If all else fails, [get a dog.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/smarter-living/how-to-work-from-home- if-youve-never-done-it-before.html) At the end of the day, put away your laptop and other work materials so that you can unwind."
Should I stock up on groceries?,"No one knows how long many of us will have to work from or stay home, so having food and supplies on hand is essential. Melissa Clark, a cookbook author and food writer for the Times, [recently wrote about ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/dining/how-to-stock-a- pantry.html)stocking your pantry.  But experts say people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty appearance of store shelves, food suppliers and retailers [say the supply chain remains strong](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/business/coronavirus- food-shortages.html). In the meantime, plan two weeks of meals. Substitute ingredients if you are missing something. Be creative. And don’t forget to be generous with your neighbors."
Can I have friends over?,"You shouldn’t. As the outbreak has progressed, officials around the world have banned increasingly smaller gatherings: 500 people, to 250, to 50, to 10. In mid-March, Germany [banned groups](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/world/europe/germany-coronavirus- budget.html) larger than two.  Social distancing means that unless you are already sharing a home with someone, you should not interact with them if you can help it. Instead of having people over for dinner or a game night, try talking to them outside — while you all stay several feet apart."
Can I still get mail?,"The U.S. Postal Service, UPS and FedEx are still delivering the mail, but to continue doing so requires a healthy work force, and at least 20 postal workers have tested positive for the virus. Workers for UPS and FedEx [share similar fears](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/coronavirus-post-office- workers.html) about contracting the virus, especially at warehouses where the mail is handled. Increasingly, letter carriers and delivery people are leaving packages on doorsteps and limiting close interaction with residents.  A recent study found that the virus disintegrates over about 24 hours on cardboard, suggesting that packages may have only low levels of the virus — unless the delivery person has coughed or sneezed on it or has handled it with contaminated hands. If you are concerned about the risk, wipe down packages with disinfectant wipes and wash your hands."
How can I exercise if I’m cooped up all day?,"Gyms are closed, and you can’t get close to people, so contact sports are out of the question. But it’s still possible to get your heart pumping and body moving.  [A running boom is taking off](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/sports/running-exercise- coronavirus.html), courtesy of the coronavirus, and several gyms, health clubs and yoga studios are now [offering classes online](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/style/self-care/isolation-exercise- meditation-coronavirus.html).  “Every little bit of movement counts,” said Dani Johnson, a physical therapist at the [Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program](https://healthyliving.mayoclinic.org/). “So when we’re confined to our home, move, move, move.”  You don’t need fancy equipment or a lot of time; you just need to weave exercise into your schedule."
Can I get my pet sick? Can my pet get me sick?,"There is no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can spread the coronavirus, according to [the World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/inaugural-who-partners- forum/coronavirus-poster-english-srilanka.pdf?sfvrsn=289dedc3_0) and [the C.D.C.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/animals.html)  A dog owned by a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong [showed some level of virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/science/animals-pets- coronavirus.html) in its nose and mouth, what researchers called a “weak positive.” But health authorities said it was likely a case of a human transmitting it to the dog, not the other way around, and that people should not be worried about the welfare of their pets."
My kids are scared. What can I tell them?,"Before you talk to your children, it’s important to [understand your own anxiety and keep it in check.](https://parenting.nytimes.com/childrens- health/coronavirus-kids-talk) If your child is worried about the coronavirus, listen to him or her, rather than respond with comments like, “It’ll be fine.” Dismissive reactions can make children feel like they’re not being heard, said Abi Gewirtz, a clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Minnesota.  Emphasize the importance of washing hands after using the bathroom and before or after meals. Children (and adults) should sing [“Happy Birthday” ](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html)twice to make sure they’ve been washing their hands for at least 20 seconds. You should also frame school cancellation as positive — more time to have more fun at home! — and encourage your children to get exercise."
"My state isn’t under any orders to stay at home. So I don’t have to, right?","The situation is changing daily, as it becomes clear the outbreak has spread to more parts of the country. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren’t being told to stay at home, it’s still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people."
Can I go to the park?,"Yes! Getting exercise outside is a great alternative to going to the gym, where touching high-contact equipment can pose a risk (if your gym is even still open). A [study last year found infectious germs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6339305/) on about a third of the surfaces at 16 different fitness facilities. Exercise boosts our immune systems, and even a single workout can improve our ability to fight off germs, [according to the latest research](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/well/move/exercise-immunity- infection-coronavirus.html). Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea."
Should I get on the subway? Go to the grocery store?,"This decision is personal and depends on your tolerance for risk. Many places around the world have ordered — or strongly urged — residents to stay indoors, unless they absolutely need to be outside.  If you can avoid the subway, that may be smart, but if you can’t, there are things you can do to minimize your risk. Avoid jam-packed cars. If you need to hold onto a pole, use a disposable glove that you can throw away when you leave the subway.[ Avoid touching your face.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/health/stop-touching-your-face- coronavirus.html) At the grocery store, wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home."
What’s an essential service? Who decides that?,"In places where officials have called for workplaces to be shuttered, there are exemptions for “essential” services and businesses. Those institutions can remain open for customers and have workers onsite.  In the United States there are[ ](https://www.cisa.gov/identifying-critical- infrastructure-during-covid-19)[federal guidelines](https://www.cisa.gov/identifying-critical-infrastructure-during- covid-19) for what is considered an essential service, but decisions are often made at the state level. For example, here are some lists of essential services in[ ](http://www.apple.com)[New York](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-issues-guidance- essential-services-under-new-york-state-pause-executive-order),[ ](https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-essential- services)[Massachusetts](https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-essential- services),[ ](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential- needs/)[California](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential- needs/) and[ ](https://www2.illinois.gov/sites/coronavirus/FAQ/Pages/Stay-At- Home- FAQS.aspx#qst7)[Illinois](https://www2.illinois.gov/sites/coronavirus/FAQ/Pages/Stay- At-Home-FAQS.aspx#qst7). All four states consider pharmacies, gas stations, laundromats and groceries to be essential, and all of them say restaurants can stay open for take-out and delivery orders.  Typically, essential services also include utilities, telecommunications and transportation providers; animal shelters and veterinary services; manufacturers and distributors of basic goods; and child care for those who work in essential services."
What are my rights if I’m worried about going to work?,"Employers have to provide[ ](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html)[a safe workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for Covid-19, the C.D.C. has said that[ ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business- response.html)[employers should tell their employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance- business-response.html) \-- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.  [Many states have stay-at-home orders](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home- order.html), but even if your employment is exempt and requires you to come in, you could still ask about working from home. Otherwise, you’d probably have to use paid time off or take a leave of absence — if that’s an option."
Can I take my laundry to a laundromat? Is that safe?,"The C.D.C. has guidelines about laundry. It says do not shake dirty laundry, to minimize the possibility of dispersing the virus through the air. If possible, wash items using the warmest water setting, and dry thoroughly. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill person can be washed with other people’s items, the C.D.C. said.  Clean and disinfect hampers or other carts for transporting laundry, according to the guidelines for cleaning surfaces.  The need for physical distancing has prompted some laundromats to dismantle their seating areas, according to Planet Laundry, the magazine of the Coin Laundry Association. Some laundromats are asking people to stay in their cars during their wash and dry cycles, and some have removed chairs and tables to discourage people from mingling.  Commercial-grade washers and dryers operate at higher temperatures and with more rigorous mechanical action that, when combined with hot water and proper detergent use, can effectively flush contaminants from clothing better than residential machines, says the association, which represents 30,000 small businesses."
Where does the name coronavirus come from?,"The coronavirus looks like a ball covered with spikes. Its outline is almost like a crown. That’s how coronavirus got its name, because “corona” is Latin for crown.  Listen [A kid’s guide to coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/podcasts/the-daily/kids- coronavirus.html) (A podcast from The Daily)"
Can you see the coronavirus? Does it have color?,"You need a microscope to see it, and the coronavirus is so small that it doesn’t have color. When you see colored pictures of them, that’s because scientists have actually added color so you can see the parts of the coronavirus more clearly.  Listen [A kid’s guide to coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/podcasts/the-daily/kids- coronavirus.html) (A podcast from The Daily)"
Can I visit my grandparents?,"You shouldn’t. But if Skype, FaceTime or another app is an option, you can make a virtual visit. And there’s always the old-fashioned telephone call, too.  The virus is especially bad for older people like your grandma and grandpa, which means it’s even more important for them to [stay away from](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/parenting/grandparents-visit-safety- coronavirus.html) other people. It can be hard, but this keeps them healthier."
Can I play on the playground?,"Probably not. You shouldn't touch the slides or swings (the virus can live on them, whether they are plastic or metal), and you'd have to stay about six feet away from other kids. Maybe go to a field and try a game of catch with one of your parents."
My school is closed. When will it reopen?,"It depends. Schools are closed for different lengths of time, and it's unclear when it will be safe to go back. Some schools are trying learning-from-home programs, and others are offering free lunches for pick-up. Ask your parents."
Can I have a playdate?,"Probably not. You'd have to stay about six feet away from your friend. Maybe a bike ride or walk, with some distance between you? Or you could try a video- chat if that's an option."
Why is it called the coronavirus? __,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that infect animals and people. In February, the W.H.O. gave official names to both this virus (SARS-CoV-2, for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the disease it causes (Covid-19, for coronavirus disease 2019).  You may have heard it called the “new” or “novel” coronavirus, and those mean just what they sound like: that it’s new."
How does it spread?,"It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out."
What makes this outbreak so different?,"Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions particularly hard — not just those with respiratory diseases."
I heard ibuprofen doesn’t work. Is that true?,"The health minister of France, Olivier Véran, recently left global health officials puzzled when he [warned that people](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-ibuprofen.html) ill with the coronavirus should stay away from painkillers like ibuprofen and aspirin. He said such nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, or Nsaids, could aggravate symptoms of the coronavirus, and suggested that people take acetaminophen instead.  Because the coronavirus is a new pathogen, there is not a lot known on how patients respond to common medications, but other experts pushed back on the French minister’s warning.  “It’s all anecdote, and fake news off the anecdotes,” said Dr. Garret FitzGerald, chair of the department of pharmacology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.  The World Health Organization has said that it is aware of no research showing that ibuprofen should not be taken by patients with Covid-19, and the F.D.A. said it was investigating the issue further and would provide more information when it becomes available."
How long can the virus live on a doorknob? On cash? On my keyboard?,"The coronavirus can live up to 72 hours on some surfaces, like plastic and steel, according [to a recent study.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-surfaces- aerosols.html) It can survive on cardboard for up to 24 hours.  The good news is that coronaviruses are easy to destroy. A disinfectant on a surface [will render it harmless](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it- spreads.html), according to Gary Whittaker, a professor of virology at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.  Although the W.H.O. has not said that cash transmits the virus, the organization said in a statement that “it is good hygiene practice to wash your hands after handling money, especially if eating or handling food.”  Are you sensing a theme? Wash your hands after touching almost anything, especially if it’s a surface outside your home."
Can the coronavirus live on my clothes?,"Yes, but a different question is what you should do about it.  A virus tends to live longer on some nonporous surfaces, like steel or plastic, as compared to fabrics like cotton or leather. But after numerous people who attended a Buddhist temple in Hong Kong fell ill, health workers did find coronavirus on the cloth covers of prayer books, among other items.  It’s probably not worth looking up stats and studies about every kind of surface in your life. The takeaway is the same: Disinfect surfaces that are touched a lot and [wash your hands](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/how-to-wash-your-hands- coronavirus.html) after touching anything, and especially before touching your face or eating. (Two Broadway composers even wrote you [a song to sing while you wash](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/well/we-wrote-you-a-hand-washing- song-listen-up.html))."
Can I still travel?,"Depending on where you want to go, not easily. In March, as more and more governments around the world hoped to slow the spread of the coronavirus, they[ began to impose travel restrictions](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-travel- restrictions.html) and even close their borders.  In the United States, President Trump has said he is considering some restrictions on domestic travel. (The military has curtailed domestic travel for service members and their families.)  And if you do go anywhere, remember to [practice social distancing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/smarter-living/coronavirus- social-distancing.html): stay away from groups and keep at least six feet of distance between you and other people."
"I don't mind being alone, but I'd like to do it somewhere else. Is it possible to road trip responsibly?","People around the United States are being told to stay home, but you might still need to make a road trip, whether to care for a loved one or for work.  If so, follow a general rule: “Don’t go far, stay in your car,” said Robert Sinclair Jr., a Northeast regional spokesman for AAA.  Mr. Sinclair offered other advice. When pumping gas, sanitize your hands after replacing the pump and before you touch the car door handle, steering wheel and any other part of the vehicle. If an attendant pumped the gas for you, sanitize your credit card after it is handed back to you.  Minimize bathroom breaks as much as possible. While this advice goes against AAA’s general advice to take a break every 100 miles, Mr. Sinclair said drivers could rest in vehicles at scenic overlooks or in parking lots of rest stops. Otherwise, wash your hands after using a public restroom and before touching your car.  And remember: With guidelines on travel changing rapidly state by state, the rules at your starting point may be different than the rules at your destination."
What about a national park? Can I go off into the wilderness and be alone?,"It’s a tempting idea, isn’t it? To explore a national park and be away from other people. Unfortunately, it was also a popular idea. As millions of Americans were asked to stay at home, so many of them decamped to national parks that in mid-March the National Park Service [ordered three of the busiest](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/us/coronavirus-national-parks- closed.html) — Yellowstone, Grand Teton and the Great Smoky Mountains — to close because of congestion."
What about my summer vacation? Should I cancel that?,"No one really knows what the course of the outbreak will be. Some airlines have already announced cuts through May, and President Trump has mentioned isolation measures lasting through July or August. The prevailing optimistic guess among experts for when the outbreak will abate hovers at about two months."
My plans got derailed. Can I get a refund?,"With airlines cutting trans-Atlantic flights and cruise lines canceling sailings, travel conditions and refund policies are changing daily.  Keep an eye on social media and official communications from your airline, hotel, cruise or wherever you booked to stay up to date with any changes to refund policies. And expect long wait times if you do need to contact a company."
"If I cancel my flight, will I get my money back?","You might! Typically, you would have to at least pay a cancellation fee or booking penalty if you did not buy a fully refundable ticket, which is usually more expensive. But many airlines, including Delta, United and American, are loosening their booking policies and suspending cancellation or rescheduling fees."
What about travel insurance?,"Typically, insurance companies will cover disrupted or canceled trips[ only under very specific circumstances](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-travel-questions- advice.html).  But if you purchased cancel-for-any-reason insurance for your trip, there’s a good chance you will get a good share of your money back. Be sure to read the fine print on your coverage before speaking with a representative."
I can’t get my airline on the phone. What should I do?,"“Obviously, the 800 numbers are overwhelmed,” said Michael Holtz, the founder and chief executive of SmartFlyer, a luxury travel agency.  Many airlines in the United States have informed travelers that they could expect longer wait times to speak to a customer service agent. Some have redirected callers to their websites and their apps, or asked travelers to leave their contact information for an agent.  Contacting an airline via social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook may be your best option right now.  “My advice is to use technology,” he said."
China seems to be getting back to normal life. How long will that take in the U.S.?,"No one knows. China began taking [draconian measures](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/china-coronavirus- travel.html) to control the coronavirus in late January, and it was not until [almost two months later](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/world/asia/china- coronavirus-zero-infections.html) that it reported no new local infections. South Korea did not lock down cities in the same way, but was extremely fast to test people, trace their contacts and quarantine infected people. And although China and South Korea have demonstrated that, with drastic actions, the virus can be brought under control, there is no guarantee it won’t resurge as their economies restart.  The U.S. has taken a much more piecemeal approach to confronting the virus. To repeat the success of other countries, experts say, [it will take extraordinary coordination and money](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-restrictions- us.html) from the government, and extraordinary trust and cooperation from citizens."
How is this going to affect the 2020 election?,"Several states have already postponed their primaries. Officials in states that are going ahead with primaries have been [trying to emphasize the new basics of voting hygiene](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/us/virus- election-voting.html), like using hand sanitizer at polling stations.  And though the general election has yet to begin, it is already [being profoundly shaped by the coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/us/politics/coronavirus-2020-campaign.html), which has become the central issue between President Trump and the two major Democratic candidates, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The pandemic’s effects on the economy have challenged Mr. Trump’s core message, that Americans are better off than before he took office. Mr. Biden has proposed a detailed plan for hospitals and research, echoing the language of presidents in past crises. He and Mr. Sanders curtailed their travel and canceled large gatherings like rallies.  It would be enormously difficult to cancel or postpone the November general election, though."
What is the U.S. government doing to help the economy?,"On March 27, Congress [passed a $2 trillion rescue package](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/coronavirus-house- voting.html), the largest economic stimulus measure in modern history, to help the people, businesses and industries affected by the coronavirus outbreak. In its sheer scope and size, the aid plan is unprecedented and touches on every facet of American life.  Its components include stimulus payments to individuals, expanded unemployment coverage that includes the self-employed, student loan changes and much more."
What are some of the details of the stimulus package?,"The legislation would send direct payments of $1,200 to millions of Americans, including those earning up to $75,000, and an additional $500 per child. It expands jobless aid, providing an additional 13 weeks and a four-month enhancement of benefits, and extends the payments for the first time to freelancers and gig workers.  The measure would also offer $377 billion in federally guaranteed loans to small businesses and establish a $500 billion government lending program for distressed companies reeling from the impact of the crisis, including allowing the administration the ability to take equity stakes in airlines that received aid to help compensate taxpayers. It would also send $100 billion to hospitals on the front lines of the pandemic."
I’ve seen movies about quarantines. How far can the government go?,"The federal government can impose quarantines under the Public Health Service Act to prevent the spread of communicable disease into the United States or between states. They’re [considered a measure of last resort](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/us/coronavirus-quarantine- questions.html) when there’s no other way to stop the spread of a deadly disease. On the state and local level, the laws vary depending on the region.  Still, the U.S. government doesn’t have the authority to impose a quarantine as sweeping as China, which confined some 70 million people in the largest effort in history. In the U.S., quarantines have been very rare. The last one was in the 1960s against a suspected smallpox outbreak. Health warnings are more common, like in 2016 when the C.D.C. advised pregnant women to avoid Southern Florida during an outbreak of the Zika virus."
Why is every country responding so differently?,"A lot has to do with politics and history. While some places, like Hong Kong, have had extensive experience with serious outbreaks and quickly put in place a plan to contain the virus, others were slower to react and [failed to take the outbreak seriously enough](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/coronavirus-world-health- organization.html), according to the W.H.O. That’s contributed to the lack of a united response. While the W.H.O. is supposed to coordinate the global response to epidemics, the group, a U.N. agency, doesn’t have the authority to force countries to follow its plan.  Culture and government also play a role. Chinese citizens responded quickly to aggressive restrictions put in place by their authoritarian government, while [Italians weren’t initially as compliant](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/08/world/europe/italy-coronavirus- quarantine.html)."
Is there a country that’s really handled this well?,"Governments worldwide have made major mistakes in trying to contain the outbreak. But as the virus spreads, South Korea, Singapore and China have been more effective than others at bringing it under control. South Korea has aggressively monitored infections, such as by [checking the body temperatures](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/world/asia/daegu-south-korea- coronavirus.html) of all incoming and outgoing passengers at train stations and other places. Officials operate drive-through testing centers and send out mobile phone alerts to citizens when new cases are reported in their districts. Singapore, which has focused on early diagnosis, isolation and contact tracing, has also seen its rate of new cases drop.  In China, new reported infections were cut to just 24 in a recent headcount [from more than 3,500 a day](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/health/coronavirus-pandemic-who.html) in late January. In addition to strict travel limitations, Chinese people are required to wear masks outdoors and have their temperatures checked at the doors of office buildings, stores, restaurants, hotels, apartments and public transit stations."
Has anyone in the government gotten sick? __,"Around the world, a number of senior officials from Iran to Australia have contracted the virus. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced on March 27 that [he tested positive](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/world/europe/boris-johnson- coronavirus.html). Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, said he was putting himself in isolation after his wife tested positive.  [President Trump tested negative for the coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/03/14/us/politics/ap-us- virus-outbreak-trump.html), officials said. Mr. Trump had been in contact with two Brazilian officials who tested positive days after meeting him in Florida. Mayor Francis Suarez of Miami, who also met the Brazilian delegation, said he tested positive. At least three members of Congress have tested positive for the coronavirus, including Senator Rand Paul."
What if Congress gets sick?,"It’s not clear, and keeping Congress at work in the Capitol may prove untenable, especially if more lawmakers fall ill or as staff and services dwindle.  During the Cold War and after Sept. 11, 2001, the government devised emergency plans to protect government officials, like a nuclear bunker for Congress in West Virginia, now a tourist attraction. Those plans relied on the ability to gather lawmakers in a safe place together, however — a hazard during a pandemic.  ""There's no serious effort to grapple with what could happen in the event of a major catastrophe,"" said Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who pushed for plans in the wake of Sept. 11. He said that a bill to allow remote voting during a national crisis, put forward by Senators Rob Portman and Richard Durbin, was ""a good start.""  So far, congressional leaders have [resisted calls for remote voting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/coronavirus-congress- voting.html), calling it a bad precedent and saying they need to address the current crisis. They have instead looked for ways to practice social distancing within the Capitol. ""There's reason to be wary about a virtual Congress,"" Mr. Ornstein said, like ensuring cybersecurity and that Americans can still see and hear lawmakers at work.  But he added that House and Senate leaders, through legislation or rule changes, could create the capacity for remote voting only in the most extreme circumstances, such as when many members are incapacitated or transportation to the Capitol or an alternate meeting place becomes impossible."
What are the symptoms of Covid-19?,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) advises that the most common symptoms are fever, tiredness, and a dry cough. The WHO says about 80 per cent of people recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Growing evidence suggests that loss of smell and taste are also symptoms of having the coronavirus. More..."
Is there a vaccine for the coronavirus?,"No, although scientists around the world have been racing to develop one. Both China and the United States have begun clinical trials. It will still be some time before a vaccine is ready for mass production, however, with the US’ National Institutes of Health saying that its clinical trial process could take up to 14 months. There are a number of antiviral treatments and vaccine trials underway. More..."
What preventive measures can be taken?,"The disease can be transmitted from person to person, usually through droplets during sneezing or coughing. To prevent the spread of the virus, the WHO recommends washing hands regularly, covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, and thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. It also suggests avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness. More..."
Should people be wearing masks in public?,"The World Health Organisation’s initial advice was that only people showing symptoms of infection or those caring for someone that has Covid-19 need to wear a face mask. However, it has now updated its position to say it supports government initiatives that require or encourage the public wearing of masks. It has emphasised that surgical masks should be preserved for medical professionals. More..."
How has the WHO responded?,"The WHO initially declared a global public health emergency, citing the potential of the virus to spread to countries not prepared to deal with the contagion. It declared the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The term is used when a disease has spread to several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people. More..."
What are the lockdown measures and travel bans in place in the region?,"Wuhan, a central city in China, implemented a lockdown on January 23 when the city’s borders were closed, incoming and outgoing flights cancelled, public transport halted, and movement of people restricted. Since then, other places in China and across Asia have implemented different degrees of travel bans and lockdown measures to curb the spread of Covid-19. More..."
What has been the impact on the Chinese and global economies?,"The steps taken to contain the outbreak, such as locking down areas and shutting down traffic flows, have shut down businesses and forced consumers to stay home. Many people have lost their jobs and their incomes, further reducing consumer spending, which makes up 60 per cent of the China economy and 70 per cent of that in the West. More..."
Will coronavirus cause a global recession in 2020?,The International Monetary Fund has said that it expects a global recession this year. China’s economy is expected to contract in the first quarter for the first time since 1976 and growth estimates for the year have been slacked to around 2 per cent from 6.1 per cent last year. The US and European economies are also expected to contract starting in the second quarter. More...
How is coronavirus transmitted?,"COVID-19 is caused by a virus known as SARS CoV-2. We already have a number of other coronaviruses that circulate in the community and most of them cause common colds. Most of the available evidence indicates that coronavirus is spread via droplets, so if an infected person coughs or sneezes, and their secretions fall on you, you may be infected too. But the most common way of becoming infected is from touching contaminated surfaces. If an infected person coughs or sneezes into their hand, then touches a hard surface such as a doorknob or railing, and you touch that surface, you could also be infected. Some experts believe the virus may also be airborne, but the wider consensus is that it’s droplet-spread. That’s why it’s so important to wash your hands often, and try to avoid touching your face, because your hands can transmit the virus into orifices such as your nose, mouth or eyes."
Is COVID-19 deadly?,"For most people, COVID-19 causes mild respiratory illness. Common symptoms are fever, shortness of breath and coughing. Some people also get a runny nose or muscle aches, although those are far less common. For some people, the disease can progress to pneumonia, and it usually gets worse in the second week. Estimates have varied, but the experience in China suggests the death rate may be about 1 per cent, although the WHO has put it slightly higher. But chances of dying depend significantly on age and state of health — the very young rarely seem to be affected at all, while the death rate in the elderly is much higher, about 15 per cent. People with comorbidities such as heart or lung conditions, or diabetes, have a higher risk of death."
Is there a cure?,"There’s no treatment for coronavirus. Some hospitals in China and in Queensland have used antiviral drugs to treat sufferers, and there are clinical trials into the effectiveness of antiviral treatments. But the care of patients is largely what’s known as supportive care, or making the patient comfortable: for example, giving Panadol to lower fever or giving oxygen if someone is struggling to breathe. In critical cases, a person would be placed on a heart-lung life-support machine in an intensive care unit, but most people who contract the virus don’t need to go to hospital and can recover at home in isolation."
When will there be a vaccine?,"A COVID-19 vaccine is probably still at least a year away. The University of Queensland has developed a vaccine candidate, and it’s being tested on animals at the moment. Human clinical trials will follow in a few months if the vaccine looks like it’s going to be effective. But getting a vaccine to the market is a slow process, because health authorities have to be 100 per cent sure it’s safe. Even once a vaccine is shown to work and to be safe, scaling up production of the vaccine can take time, so it will probably be a year to 18 months before a vaccine will be available."
Will schools and workplaces be shut down?,"It’s likely that the coronavirus pandemic will have a major impact on your daily life in the short term. Mass events will be cancelled, sporting games will be played to empty stadiums, and it’s likely that at some point your workplace might ask you to work from home. Mass school shutdowns are a last-resort measure, and whether this happens will depend on what we learn about children’s role in transmitting the virus. But these major interventions in your life won’t last forever — we’re likely to see the virus peak in Australia some time during winter, and the number of cases will then start to decline. There’s a good chance that this virus will become endemic in the population like other coronaviruses."
What can you do to protect yourself?,"The No 1 thing you can do to protect yourself from coronavirus infection is to wash your hands, often and thoroughly. You need to rub the soap for 30 seconds to kill all potential virus molecules. Washing for 20 seconds will only kill some of them. The WHO recommends singing Happy Birthday twice, but that can get pretty tedious, so choose your own favourite ditty — but make sure it’s a long one. Use hand sanitiser if you can’t get to a wash basin, but make sure it’s an alcohol-based sanitiser with at least 60 per cent alcohol content — the alcohol is required to kill viruses. Don’t touch your face, wash your hands before you eat, avoid touching hard shiny surfaces in public places such as on public transport, and stay away from sick people. Stay home if you’re sick. Cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hand, or into a tissue."
Will people have to pay taxes on the money when they file their tax returns next year?,"No. The money is not counted as taxable income. It’s treated as a fully refundable tax credit against your 2020 taxes, meaning that you get the money even if you don’t have any tax liability."
Can people get checks even if they haven’t filed a tax return in recent years?,"In cases where people haven’t filed tax returns but receive Social Security benefits or railroad retirement benefits, the IRS can look at statements about those benefits to help get the checks to those people.

For people who have not filed a 2018 or 2019 tax return and do not receive Social Security or railroad retirement benefits, there is an incentive to promptly file a tax return to ensure that the IRS can reach them to distribute the money to them this year. 

People who do not file tax returns are typically low-income. For example, the IRS requires married couples with both spouses under 65 to file returns for 2019 if their gross income was at least $24,400. That threshold is raised to $27,000 in cases where both spouses were 65 or older. Social Security benefits often aren’t included in gross income."
"Are immigrants eligible to receive the checks?

",They are if they have a Social Security number. A Republican aide to the Senate Finance Committee noted in a call with reporters Wednesday that Green Card holders qualify for work-eligible Social Security numbers.
"Are college students eligible to receive the checks?

","If college students are at least 17 years old and are claimed as a dependent on their parents’ return, their family would not receive any payment amount for them. A college student who filed his or her own return and was not claimed as a dependent on his or her parents’ return would qualify for the rebates."
"I made $85,000 last year. How much money will I receive?

","For a single tax filer, the rebate amount reduces by $5 for every $100 of income over $75,000. So a single person with no children who had adjusted gross income of $85,000 in 2019, and has already filed a 2019 tax return, would receive $700.

Keep in mind that phase-out of the credit is based on people’s adjusted gross income, which does not include income put into pre-tax accounts such as traditional 401(k)s. As a result, someone with an annual salary of $85,000 and no other income could have adjusted gross income of less than $85,000."
"How can people who recently moved ensure they get their checks?

","If you received a refund in 2018 or 2019 via direct deposit to your bank account, and you did not change your bank account when you moved, you should be able to receive your rebate via direct deposit.

Tax experts said that they think it would be helpful for the IRS to provide guidance for taxpayers who have moved or have new bank accounts since they filed their most recent tax return.

Under the bill, the IRS has to send a notice to a taxpayer’s last known address within 15 days of distributing a payment. The notice should provide information about the payment amount, the method used to make the payment and an IRS phone number to report failures to receive the payment."
"How are check amounts impacted if someone has a child in 2020?

","Tax experts said that since advanced payment amounts are based on taxpayers’ 2018 or 2019 returns, people who have children in 2020 would receive payments this year that don't take into account the new children. However, the rebates are credits against 2020 taxes, so new parents will get the additional credit reflecting their children when they file their 2020 tax returns next year."
"What are areas where IRS guidance might be helpful?

","The coronavirus relief bill is not yet law, and the IRS has yet to provide information about how it plans to implement the provision about the rebates. On the IRS’s coronavirus landing page, the agency is telling people not to call it right now and to check back for updates at a later point.

Tax experts are hoping that the IRS issues guidance to clarify issues about eligibility when taxpayers’ situations differ in 2018, 2019 and 2020, as well as guidance about which nonfilers now need to submit a tax return in order to receive a payment."
What is this thing?,"Coronaviruses are a relatively broad family of viruses named for the spikes that come out of a virus particle. Under a microscope, they look like a crown, or a halo — like the sun’s corona.
The current coronavirus first emerged from Wuhan, in China’s Hubei Province, most likely from a fish and animal market where humans routinely come into direct contact with animals. The virus probably jumped from an animal — we still don’t know for sure what species — to a human, a process of interspecies transmission called zoonosis.
The virus itself is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2. The disease caused by the virus is called coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19."
How many people are infected?,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported at least 81,191 cases of the virus as of Wednesday morning. The vast majority of those cases, 78,064, are in mainland China, and most of those are in Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak.
But officials are increasingly worried about South Korea, where the number of cases has climbed from just a handful to more than 1,200 in the last week or so. An outbreak in Italy has infected 322 people, a worrying sign that the virus may be gaining a foothold in Europe. Seven other European nations confirmed new cases of the virus overnight. And an outbreak in Iran has infected more than 100 residents.
“The sudden increases in cases in Italy, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Korea are deeply concerning,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday.
The Iranian outbreak has spawned new cases in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman; the Italian outbreak is now linked to cases in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland.
Tuesday marked a sobering moment for epidemiologists watching the virus: It was the first day that more new cases were confirmed in countries besides China than new cases in China itself, according to the WHO.
There have been 57 cases diagnosed in the United States, 36 of whom were repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Most of the rest of the cases have occurred in travelers who have recently returned from China. Just two people have been infected in the United States itself."
How deadly is the virus?,"We don’t entirely know yet. Of the 81,191 confirmed cases, 2,768 people have died, a mortality rate of about 3 percent. That would be worse than the Spanish Flu, which had a mortality rate of about 2 percent, and substantially worse than a more ordinary influenza, which kills between one in a thousand and one in ten thousand people.
But there are lots of unknowns.
First, the bad news: Only about 30,000 people have recovered from the virus, which leaves 50,000 or so still in some stage of treatment. Not all of those people will recover, so the mortality rate is expected to rise at least a little bit.
Now, the good news: That 81,191 figure represents only the number of confirmed cases. It appears likely that many thousands more were infected and either did not suffer symptoms or suffered symptoms too minor to seek treatment. In that case, the mortality rate is probably substantially lower than the statistics make it seem."
How sick will the coronavirus make someone?,"That depends on your underlying health. Coronaviruses are not uncommon — you’ve almost certainly had several during your lifetime, and at worst you might have called in sick with a common cold. And even if you contract this particular coronavirus, you may show few if any signs.
But if your health is poor already — especially your respiratory system — this virus is more troubling. Many of those who have succumbed have been older, and young children may be particularly susceptible as well. Those who become ill will have problems in their upper respiratory tract; those who become severely ill will have problems in the lower respiratory tract, and those can lead to really serious health concerns like pneumonia and bronchitis."
What are the symptoms?,"The CDC says the symptoms are similar to those of a common cold. A patient might develop a fever, a cough, and shortness of breath. At the moment, it appears someone who is infected can show symptoms as early as two days later and as long as 14 days after they have been infected, based on past coronavirus outbreaks like MERS and SARS."
How easy is it to catch the coronavirus?,"Tom Frieden, who directed the CDC for eight years during the Obama administration, says it’s too early to know exactly how transmissible the virus is, how long it lives on surfaces or how many people who get the disease become really sick.
“There’s still a lot we don’t know about this infection. We don’t know how readily it spreads, we don’t know, really, what proportion of people get severely ill,” he told The Hill.
But what we do know is that the virus spreads from person to person through air droplets, much like an influenza. That makes it dissimilar from something more deadly, like Ebola, which spreads only when someone comes into contact with another person’s bodily fluids. There are signs, too, that the coronavirus can transmit even before someone shows symptoms, which is going to cause problems for health officials trying to contain its spread.
Now is a good opportunity to remind ourselves the lessons we teach toddlers: Wash your hands a lot. Cough or sneeze into your elbow. Stay at home if you’re sick. Those little steps end up having big, positive consequences.
Anyone who comes into contact with someone infected with the virus should notify their health care provider, the CDC says. Older people and young children, especially those with underlying health concerns, are at the most risk."
What about a vaccine? Or treatments?,"The coronavirus is a new phenomenon, which means scientists are only now beginning to research possible treatments or vaccines. No treatments have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, though there is a drug being tested on a patient who was repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
That drug, Remdesivir, was first developed as a potential treatment for MERS and SARS in animals and for Ebola in humans. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is working on a study to test whether the drug would be a suitable treatment for this coronavirus.
But until a treatment is developed, someone with a severe case of the virus will be treated with supportive care — in extreme cases, with intubation tubes and breathing machines.
The real silver bullet for any epidemic or pandemic is a vaccine — and that’s going to take a while. Some in the Trump administration have promised a vaccine within the space of a few months, but that’s extremely unlikely. Instead, the top expert in the federal government, NIAID Director Anthony Fauci, has said he hopes to have a vaccine developed in the next 12 to 18 months, a relatively fast timeline by scientific standards."
Where should I get my information about the virus?,"Public health officials are increasingly worried about misinformation that seems to accompany every outbreak, fueled by social media and inflammatory rhetoric.
If you hear a rumor about the virus, check it out with reputable sources — the CDC, state health agencies and the WHO all have websites with the most up-to-date information about the virus and its spread.
Increasingly, those agencies also have fact-checking sections on their websites, aimed at combating misinformation. One of the most troubling rumors that often spreads alongside outbreaks is who exactly has the disease — something that can lead to racial and ethnic profiling.
Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said it is important to separate the disease from the person suffering from the disease. No ethnic group is more or less susceptible to the coronavirus.
“My concern is that fear and misinformation will spread much faster than this virus will,” Shah said in an interview Wednesday.
Bottom line: If you hear what sounds like unrealistic information, check it out before you pass it around social media."
What is the U.S. government doing to combat the virus?,"At the moment, the federal government is doing a lot of warning. The CDC has produced two dozen guidance documents for hospitals, instructions for preparedness and infection control. Crucially, they are offering guidance on preserving personal protection equipment — like masks and gloves — in a recognition that a widespread outbreak is likely to impact already-low supplies.
The Trump administration has created a task force to oversee the response, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. But the administration has not named a coordinator to oversee a whole-of-government response, similar to what the Obama administration did during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
In other words, there is no one person whose full-time job is to oversee the government’s response.
President TrumpDonald John TrumpWaPo: Trump allegedly asked Fauci if officials could let coronavirus 'wash over' US Kansas Supreme Court upholds order banning religious services of over 10 people Biden wins Alaska primary MORE plans to hold a press conference on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. ET alongside members of his coronavirus task force. His administration has requested $2.5 billion in emergency funding, but even Republicans have been skeptical that that’s enough to handle a widespread outbreak. Senate Democrats on Wednesday said they would seek $8.5 billion in funding.
On a state level, hospitals and public health officials are preparing for a growing number of cases. State health directors happen to be in Washington this week for an annual meeting, and many spent Wednesday walking the halls of Congress, lobbying their members to support funding.
At home, those officials are working to make sure their hospitals have the capacity they need to handle an outbreak — enough beds, enough equipment and protective gear, enough laboratory capacity to test samples they take from potentially infected victims, and enough people to run the tests.
“We’re starting to work with hospitals and EMS systems initially to make sure that they have all the capacity that they need,” Shah said of Maine’s preparations. “The public should appreciate that hospitals are used to taking care of sick people. That is what they do.”
What are the broader risks, beyond the virus?
We’ve already seen the virus’s impact in China, where factories and stores closed for days or weeks and cities have been quarantined to stop its spread. Other countries may follow China’s lead. Frieden said the outbreak is likely to cost at least $100 billion to combat globally — and maybe ten times as much, if things spiral out of control.
But as in other outbreaks, the fallout is going to extend beyond immediate health concerns. When Ebola broke out in West Africa, more people died from other, treatable diseases — malaria, cholera, even HIV — because the health systems shut down.
In this case, China is a major source of the generic drugs used in the United States, for everything from hypertension to diabetes. The virus is likely to impact supply chains, making scarce drugs that are completely unrelated to the coronavirus. Experts recommend keeping a three-month supply of any prescription drugs you take on hand in case of that disruption.
“The Chinese manufacturing issue will affect us,” says Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Preparedness at the University of Minnesota. “We’ll have a major shortfall between what will be needed and what will be available.”
Personal protective equipment, like masks and gloves, are already in short supply after a particularly bad flu season. Manufacturers are rushing to fill the gaps, but that takes time, and global demand is growing.
The Department of Health and Human Services said it has a stockpile of about 30 million masks, but says it needs 300 million to protect front-line health care workers. Those workers, who treat patients, would be most at risk of contracting the virus; more than 3,000 health care workers have been infected in China already.
The broader economic impact is also unknown, though Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said in a note to investors Wednesday that the odds of a recession in the first half of the year now stand at 40 percent, twice what he predicted a few months ago.
“If it is a pandemic, if it does show up in Europe and the United States, then that is the prescription for a global and U.S. recession,” he said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 are both off more than 6 percent in the last two days, the worst two-day drop in years.
There is a decent chance that major sporting events and public gatherings will be delayed or canceled. A major trade show, the Mobile World Congress, has already been canceled in Barcelona, Spain. Soccer games have been canceled in Italy, and political demonstrations are temporarily banned in Seoul, South Korea.
The organizers of the Tokyo Olympics, set for later this year, have insisted the games will go on. But a former top International Olympic Committee official, Dick Pound, cast doubt on those plans on Tuesday, saying the organizers had about a three-month window in which to decide to pull the plug.
The last time the Olympics were canceled was in 1944, when games scheduled for Italy and London were scrapped because of World War II."
Can people get checks even if they haven’t filed a tax return in recent years?,"In cases where people haven’t filed tax returns but receive Social Security benefits or railroad retirement benefits, the IRS can look at statements about those benefits to help get the checks to those people.

Should you get tested for Covid-19 if you have a mild cold?,"Should you get tested for Covid-19 if you have a mild cold? Even if you have a fever, cough, severe cold or sore throat, you don't need to get tested for Covid-19. But if you have travelled to a Covid-19 affected country or have come in close contact with a person who has been laboratory-confirmed to be Covid-19 positive then, if you fulfil these two additional criteria, you need to get tested for Covid-19. For common cold one only needs regular treatment."
How long does it take for Covid-19 symptoms to appear?,"How long does it take for Covid-19 symptoms to appear? The incubation period usually takes 2-7 days but can take up to 14 days also. In most cases, after a person is infected, it takes up to 5-7 days for symptoms like cold and cough to appear."
Should everyone be wearing masks?,"Should everyone be wearing masks? Everyone need not wear a mask. If you have a cough and cold, you should wear a mask to not transmit the infection to others. if you are a healthcare worker looking after Covid-19 patients, then you need to wear a mask. But otherwise, a person who is going out for their day-to-day work, doesn't need to wear a mask. Sometimes it can be harmful too because if you wear a mask you keep adjusting it and touching your face. In case you do end up touching an infected surface and then touch your mask, you might end up infecting yourself. There is no data to substantiate if healthy people benefit from wearing masks."
What about people who have existing respiratory conditions like asthma etc. do they need to wear a mask?,"What about people who have existing respiratory conditions like asthma etc. do they need to wear a mask? People with asthma or any other respiratory conditions should wash their hands frequently, minimise their social interactions and avoid going to crowded places where there is a higher chance of getting infected."
What if a colleague gets infected?,"What if a colleague gets infected? If you have come in close contact with someone who has tested positive, you should go into self-quarantine for two weeks. If you show symptoms, get tested."
Is it safe to visit hospitals?,"Is it safe to visit hospitals? Yes, it is safe to go to hospitals as Covid-19 patients are kept in separate isolation wards. The Covid-19 virus does not spread very far. If you have Covid-19 patients isolated in one area of the hospital then the virus won't reach the other area. Nonetheless, hospitals are crowded during flu season, so try postponing your visit to the OPD for routine checkups."
Will summer or humidity kill Covid-19?,"Will summer or humidity kill Covid-19? Chances are it won't. It might reduce the transmissibility of the virus due to extreme heat. But we have seen tropical countries like Singapore report a good number of cases despite humidity. Plus during summers, people generally spend more time indoors and in air-conditioned spaces, where the temperature is low. This can instead spread the virus. Since we still don't know how this pandemic will play out in India, practicing social distancing is the best option."
"Can a person cured of Covid-19, get infected again?","Can a person cured of Covid-19, get infected again? This is a viral infection. Like swine flu or H1N1, if you are exposed to it, you can get infected again. But once you get the infection, the human system develops antibodies to fight the virus which is why in case you contract the infection again it is likely to be less severe than before. So, if after getting cured for Covid-19, you end up getting infected again, you might have milder symptoms."
Is herd immunity a better preventive strategy than social distancing?,"Is herd immunity a better preventive strategy than social distancing? The United Kingdom is using this model where it is allowing the virus to spread but is protecting the higher-risk group like the elderly people and people with heart conditions, hypertension, respiratory diseases etc. The idea is that since mortality is much less in younger age groups, they may end up having a large number of positive cases but will also lead to herd immunity given their lower mortality rate. As per experts, one problem with herd immunity is that if younger people get infected and infect the elderly at their home etc, then it can lead to higher mortality. This is why experts feel that social distancing is a better method in case of India."
"Does yoga, pranayam help build immunity against Covid-19?","Does yoga, pranayam help build immunity against Covid-19? There is no evidence that yoga, pranayam, ayurvedic or homoeopathic drugs are effective in treating Covid-19. Some people argue that since these exercises help build immunity, it can help fight the virus. That may or may not be the case. But as of now, there is no data supporting this as a treatment."
Does drinking alcohol kill coronavirus?,"Does drinking alcohol kill coronavirus? Alcohol is no solution. If you consume a lot of alcohol, it can make you drowsy and can compromise your immunity. Experts say that this might make you aspirate and that will make you susceptible to viruses."
How likely am I to catch COVID-19?,"The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19. COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It's important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go."
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with a simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose."
Is there anything I should not do?,"These measures are not effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful: Smoking, Wearing multiple masks, Taking antibiotics. In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider."
Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed. To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."
How does COVID-19 spread?,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick."
Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?,"The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating."
Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?,"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines."
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don't develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."
How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?,"The ""incubation period"" means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available."
How long can coronavirus last on different surfaces?,"Viruses remain infectious on cardboard for 24 hours, and 3 days on plastic and stainless steel. So don't fail to wash up after touching these surfaces."
Should I worry about COVID-19?,"Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings."
What is COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019."
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?,"You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

 1: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

 2: Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

 3: Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

 4: Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.

 5: Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

 6: Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places - especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas."
"How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask?","1: Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.

2: Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water

3: Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.

4: Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).

5: Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).

6: Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.

7: Pull down the mask's bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.

8: After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.

9: Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.

10: Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask - Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water."
What is a coronavirus?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19."
"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?","Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing."
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?,"Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. See previous answer on ""How does COVID-19 spread?"""
Should I wear a mask to protect myself?,Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask.
Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?,"The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill."
Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?,"No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different. SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003."

Can I go out?,"Can I go out?
Avoid. A person should venture out of his home only for essential needs. People should also avoid public transport as much as possible."
What does it feel like?,"What does it feel like?
Some cruise ship passengers described symptoms similar to the common cold or flu. ""It's been a 2 on a scale of 10,"" said Carl Goldman, who was hospitalized in Omaha, Nebraska, after flying home. However, a Chinese postgraduate student described going to the hospital twice after her symptoms worsened, and feeling ""a heavy head while walking, unable to breathe, and nauseous."""
How deadly is it?,"How deadly is it?
That won't be known until large studies are done to test big groups of people to see how many have been infected and with or without symptoms. Scientists have estimated the fatality rate from less than 1% to as high as 4% among cases diagnosed so far, depending on location. Flu kills about 0.1% of those it infects, so the new virus seems about 10 times more lethal, the National Institutes of Health's Dr. Anthony Fauci told Congress last week. The death rate has been higher among people with other health problems -- more than 10% for those with heart disease, for example. In the US, 30 million have diabetes, more than 70 million are obese and nearly 80 million have high blood pressure."
What are the symptoms?,"What are the symptoms?
Most people get fever and cough, sometimes fatigue or shortness of breath, and recover after about two weeks. About 15% develop severe disease, including pneumonia, Chinese scientists reported from 45,000 cases there. Symptoms usually start slowly and often worsen as the illness goes on. In a report last week on the first 12 patients in the US, seven were hospitalized; most had underlying health problems and got worse during the second week of illness. In China, slightly more males have been diagnosed with COVID-19 than females, which might be because roughly half of Chinese men smoke but only 5% of females do, Frieden said. Children seem to get less sick -- a report on 10 in China found that fevers tended to be milder and they lacked clear signs of pneumonia."
Will it go away in the summer?,"Will it go away in the summer?
Flu fades each spring and the new virus may do the same, Fauci said last week in a podcast with a journal editor. ""I am hoping that as we get into the warmer weather we will see a decline that will give us a chance to get our preparedness up to speed,"" Fauci said. But that, too, is far from certain. ""We have to assume that the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread, and it's a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza,"" said Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization's emergencies chief. Flu viruses also mutate quickly, requiring new vaccines to be made each year. If the coronavirus follows suit, Frieden said, ""It could become a virus that circulates around the world for many years to come."""
What's the test like?,"What's the test like?
The CDC recommends at least two swabs -- nose and throat. Samples are sent to labs that look for bits of viral genetic material, which takes roughly 4 to 6 hours. Altogether, it can take several days to ship a sample and get results back. It's been taking two to three days, and ""we are working really hard to see if we can shorten that time"" by developing an in-house test, Dr. Aimee Moulin of the University of California, Davis said Thursday in a conference call held by the American College of Emergency Physicians. Some areas have opened drive-thru sites for testing, which could reduce exposure to health workers and other patients or the public."
How fast does it spread?,"How fast does it spread?
 Each infected person spreads to two or three others on average, researchers estimate. It spreads more easily than flu but less than measles, tuberculosis or some other respiratory diseases. It is not known if it spreads less easily among children, but fewer of them have been diagnosed with the disease. A study of 1,099 patients in China found that 0.9% of the cases were younger than 15."
How it spreads,"How it spreads
Most spread is from droplets produced when an infected person coughs, which are inhaled by people nearby. Transmission from touching contaminated surfaces hasn't been shown yet, though recent tests by US scientists suggest it's possible -- one reason they recommend washing your hands and not touching your face. The virus can live in the air for several hours, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. Cleaning surfaces with solutions containing diluted bleach should kill it. ""While we are still learning about the biology of this virus, it does not appear that there is a major risk of spread through sweat,"" said Julie Fischer, a Georgetown University microbiologist. The biggest concern about going to the gym is infected people coughing on others, or contaminating shared surfaces or equipment, she said. Consider avoiding large classes and peak hours and don't go if you're coughing or feverish, she suggests. The risk of virus transmission from food servers is the same risk as transmission from other infected people, but ""one of the concerns in that food servers, like others facing stark choices about insurance and paychecks, may be pressured to work even if they are sick,"" she said."
Can infected people who recover get it again?,"Can infected people who recover get it again?
It's not known. A few reports from China say some people had COVID-19, recovered and then fell ill again. It's unclear if that's a relapse, a new infection, or a case where the person never fully recovered in the first place. Scientists at the at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle say the 30,000-letter genetic code of the virus changes by one letter every 15 days. It's not known how many of these changes would be needed for the virus to seem different enough to the immune system of someone who had a previous version of it for it to cause a fresh infection. Fauci told Congress on Thursday that it was unlikely that someone could get reinfected. ""We haven't formally proved it, but it is strongly likely that that's the case,"" he said. ""Because if this acts like any other virus, once you recover, you won't get reinfected."""
When is the virus most contagious?,"When is the virus most contagious?
The average time from exposure to developing symptoms is five to six days, but can be up to two weeks. Tests have found high amounts of virus in the throats and noses of people a couple days before they show symptoms. Signs of virus also have been found in stool weeks after patients recover, but that doesn't mean it's capable of causing illness, scientists warn. ""The virus can be degraded,"" said Robert Webster, a St. Jude Children's Research Center virus expert. ""It's not necessarily infectious virus at all."""
"If a person tests positive for influenza, they are not tested for coronavirus. Could a person have both?","Yes, a person could have both. This was the case for one patient in China, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 69-year-old man in Wuhan had both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. Doctors initially diagnosed the man with the flu and later diagnosed the coronavirus.

Doctors studying the patient said the case ""suggests that COVID-19 might be underdiagnosed because of false-negative tests for upper respiratory specimens or co-infection with other respiratory viruses. Broader viral testing might be needed.""

Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, agrees.

""I don’t like that people are doing flu tests and saying therefore it’s not coronavirus,"" Hotez said. ""Traditionally, for flu, we know it’s possible to get other co-infectious with other viruses."""
Can testing show if someone has had coronavirus and then recovered?,"Yes, but it depends on what kind of test you do. ""If you do an antibody test, in theory it could show that you had the virus and then recovered,"" Hotez said.

To do an antibody test, you'd need to have blood drawn. But coronavirus tests in the U.S. aren't being done this way."
Will mosquitos be able to catch this virus and pass it on to humans this summer?,"No, Hotez says. As far as we know, it's not a mosquito-transmitted virus."
Is it best to cancel routine doctor and dental appointments?,"Federal health officials are asking Americans to stay home as much as possible and cancel any elective surgeries. Some local and state governments have implemented stricter rules.

If it's possible to keep your appointment and speak with your provider over the phone or video, you should. However, if you cannot speak with a provider remotely and are able to reschedule your in-person appointment for a later date, you should."
What is involved in testing for the coronavirus? Is it the same as when they do a nasal swab for influenza?,"To collect a sample for a diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, doctors typically use the same method of collection as they would for influenza: a nasopharyngeal swab. For this swab, a tiny Q-tip on plastic or a wire stem is put up your nose about 3 or 4 inches.

""I've had it done, and it's mildly uncomfortable for a few seconds,"" said Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group.

A doctor may also do a throat swab. In some cases, if you have a ""wet"" cough, a doctor may also have you cough up some phlegm into a collection cup. These specimen are then packed with ice and shipped to a lab for testing.

To determine if someone has recovered from the coronavirus, at least two different nasal swabs taken at least 24 hours apart must test negative, Poland said."
Should people in their 60s be concerned? Are they considered elderly?,"As with seasonal flu, people at highest risk for severe disease and death include people over the age of 60 and those with underlying conditions, according to the World Health Organization.

""Starting at age 60, there is an increasing risk of disease and the risk increases with age. The highest risk of serious illness and death is in people older than 80 years,"" Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters in a recent telebriefing.

The CDC recommends that people over 60 stock up on supplies, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact, wash hands often, avoid crowds as much as possible, avoid cruises and don't fly on planes unless absolutely necessary."
"How likely are you to die from the virus?
","Of the more than 586,000 people who have been infected worldwide, more than 26,000 have died. That's a death rate of about 4.6%. The WHO has previously estimated the rate at about 3.4%.

The death rate, however, varies widely based on age, health and geographic location. People who are older or who have preexisting conditions are at higher risk of severe illness."
Can someone get the coronavirus more than once?,"Scientists aren't sure yet. For many viruses, including the MERS virus, patients are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover because a protective antibody is generated in those who are infected. But scientists still need to do more research to determine if this is also the case with COVID-19 and how long those antibodies may last.

""However, in certain individuals, the antibody cannot last that long. For many patients who have been cured, there is a likelihood of relapse,"" said Li QinGyuan, director of pneumonia prevention and treatment at China Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing.

Poland agreed, saying the chance of reinfection is ""very likely."""
Are infected people able to transmit the virus to their pets and visa versa?,"No, there is no evidence that pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the WHO.

Last month, the pet dog of a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong tested ""weak"" positive for COVID-19 and was put in quarantine. Scientists concluded that pet cats and dogs can test positive for low levels of the pathogen if they catch it from their owners, but pets can't get sick from the virus."
How do the coronavirus stats compare to other bad flu seasons?,"In the U.S., influenza has caused 12,000 to 61,000 deaths annually since 2010, according to the CDC. So far this flu season in the U.S., there have been at least 38 million flu illnesses, 400,000 hospitalizations and 24,000 deaths from flu, according to the CDC."
Is it safe to swim at an indoor public pool? Can someone be infected there?,"Properly chlorinated pool water kills viruses, but you can still catch the coronavirus at the pool through other means, including: If you touch a surface that has the virus on it, or if an infected person coughs or sneezes and the respiratory droplets enter your mouth or nose, according to the CDC."
How long does the virus live on an object like a dollar bill?,"Depending on the type of surface, the virus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, according to the WHO. A recent study by scientists in the U.S. found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. 

However, a subsequent report from the CDC found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks. The CDC found traces of the virus' RNA, not the coronavirus itself, on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship – 17 days after passengers had left the cabins.

It's possible that you can become infected if you touch your face after touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, according to the CDC. But scientists don't think surfaces are the main way that the virus spreads; the most common form of infection is from respiratory droplets spread by a person's cough or sneeze, the CDC reports.

Meanwhile, the WHO says it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. That means the virus cannot spread through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting coronavirus cases.

At the same time, the WHO is reportedly encouraging people to use as many digital payment options as possible. Viruses can survive on hard surfaces like coins for days in some cases. U.S dollars, a blend of fabric and paper, are harder for viruses to stick to."
What is being given to treat the coronavirus once you’ve become infected?,"There is no vaccine for the new virus and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-19, so treatment consists of supportive care to help relieve symptoms and, for severe cases, care to support vital organ functions, the CDC says.

About 80% of people recover from the disease without needing special treatment, according to the WHO. For most patients, that means drinking plenty of fluids and resting, just as you would for the cold or flu."
How many children have been diagnosed with the virus? How many of them have died?,"Among the more than 4,000 cases in the U.S. as of March 16, only 5% were people aged 0–19 years, according to the CDC. Just 2%–3% of cases in that age group had to be hospitalized, and none were in the ICU.

This week, however, health officials reported that a 17-year-old teen in New Orleans died after contracting the virus. And a 2-month-old in Nashville who tested positive for the virus could be the youngest patient in the nation, officials say. In China, at least one two-day-old infant had been infected, according to a WHO study."
What are dangers to pregnant women?,
Is the presence of a fever always the first symptom of a coronavirus infection? Is there any value in taking your temperature every day?,"Symptoms of COVID-19 resemble the flu and include fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the CDC. Some people also develop aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.

While fever is one of the most common symptoms, it's not productive to take your temperature every day, Poland said.

""That's like taking your blood pressure four times a day for no particular good reason. I’d probably not do that unless there's a reason to do it. For example, if you felt feverish, or if you traveled to a high-risk area, or if you had contact with somebody (infected),"" he said."
How can I know if I have the coronavirus and should go for a test?,"If you have symptoms and want to get tested, the CDC recommends calling your state or local health department or a medical provider.

Not sure if you should get tested? The CDC website features a ""self-checker"" to help you make decisions about seeking medical care. The feature is not intended for the diagnosis or treatment of COVID-19 and is intended only for people in the U.S."
Does testing positive mean that I have the virus and that I will develop symptoms?,"Yes, testing positive means that you have the virus, but it does not mean that you will develop symptoms. Some people who have the virus don't have any symptoms at all.

At the same time, testing negative does not necessarily mean that you don't have the virus."
Can someone spread the virus without symptoms?,"Yes, some spread might be possible before people show symptoms, according to the CDC. However, people are most contagious when they are most symptomatic."
"There has been a Hong Kong flu, a Swine flu, H1N1, SARS, MERS, Ebola, Zika and other global health threats since the 1960s. How is the coronavirus different?","The current outbreak is the world's first pandemic caused by a coronavirus, a family of virsuses that includes the COVID-19 virus, according to the head of the WHO.

While more people in the U.S. were infected by and died after contracting the flu in 1968 and 2009, the new coronavirus has infected and killed more people in the U.S. than did SARS, MERS, Ebola or Zika.

By comparison, the 1968 ""Hong Kong flu"" pandemic was caused by an influenza A virus and killed an estimated 1 million people worldwide, with about 100,000 deaths in the U.S., according to the CDC. The 2009 ""swine flu"" pandemic was caused by an H1N1 subtype of the influenza A virus and killed at least 151,000 people worldwide during the first year the virus circulated, with more than 12,000 deaths in the U.S., according to the CDC. "
How old was the youngest person to die from the virus?,"A study of more than 72,000 cases in mainland China found that at least one person between ten and 19 years of age had died, but no one younger than ten had died. A subsequent study in the journal Pediatrics found that a 14-year-old boy from China died in February after contracting the coronavirus.

It was not immediately clear if anyone younger had died elsewhere in the world.

By comparison, at least 155 children in the U.S. have died after contracting the flu so far this flu season, according to the CDC."

How many people have recovered from the virus?,"More than 191,000 people worldwide have recovered from the virus as ofWednesday, according to [data from Johns HopkinsUniversity](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).Most of the recoveries have been in China, followed by Spain, Germany, Italyand Iran.Of the more than 203,000 confirmed cases in the U.S., more than 8,000 haverecovered."
Will families who receive food stamps be eligible for the stimulus check?,"Yes, families who receive food stamps are eligible to receive a stimuluscheck! The $2 trillion stimulus plan includes [one-time payments of$1,200](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/26/coronavirus-americans-start-getting-stimulus-checks-three-weeks/5078658002/) per adult and$500 per child, $367 billion for small businesses, $500 billion for loans tolarger industries, $100 billion for hospitals and the health care system, and$600 more per week in unemployment benefits for those out of work.Here's [how you cancalculate](https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2020/03/26/find-out-how-much-your-stimulus-check/2917379001/) the amount of stimulus money yourhousehold can expect."
Is the virus a DNA molecule protected by a thin layer of fat that will disintegrate if that fat layer is removed outside your body?,"SARS-CoV-2 particles are spherical bundles of genetic material (RNA)surrounded by a fatty outer layer (lipids) with proteins called spikesprotruding from the surface. These spikes latch onto receptor proteins onhuman cells in the lungs and other tissues and change the structure of thosehuman cells, allowing the viral genes to enter the host cell to be copied,producing more viruses.Viruses need a host to ""survive,"" and the fat layer breaks down when it is outon its own in the environment. [Preliminary researchsuggests](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/health/2020/03/05/coronavirus-us-cases-symptoms-travel-deaths-prepare/4904568002/) that the virus is stable outside the body for differentperiods of time, depending on the climate and surface. You can ""kill"" thevirus using soap, extreme heat and ultraviolet light, and each attacks adifferent part of this virus structure. Soap breaks up the fatty outer layer.Heat breaks up the protein spikes. And UV light breaks up the genes inside."
Has anyone with preexisting conditions gotten the coronavirus and survived?,"Yes, many people have. While the risk for serious disease and death fromCOVID-19 is higher in people who are older or who have [certain preexistingconditions](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/health/2020/03/05/coronavirus-us-cases-symptoms-travel-deaths-prepare/4904568002/), thousands have survived.Data from the CDC published Tuesday found that, as of March 28, the U.S.reported 2,692 patients who had one or more underlying health conditions. Ofthose patients, 173 died. This limited data suggests that thousands of peoplewho have one or more underlying health conditions have not died.Moreover, a [February WHO study](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) ofmore than 70,000 coronavirus patients in China found that people withpreexisting conditions had higher fatality rates than those withoutpreexisting conditions: 13.2% for those with cardiovascular disease, 9.2% fordiabetes, 8.4% for hypertension, 8.0% for chronic respiratory disease, and7.6% for cancer. However, those figures suggest that large percentages ofpeople with preexisting conditions survived."
Can coronavirus be transmitted through secondhand smoke?,"""It’s not the main mode of transmission. There's probably some component ofairborne, but I don’t think secondhand smoke would be a compounding factor,""said Tania Elliott, clinical instructor of infectious diseases at NYU Langone.If the smoke irritates your lungs and causes you to cough, that poses agreater risk of transmission since the virus is thought to mainly spreadthrough respiratory droplets when someone coughs or sneezes, Elliot said.Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 as the act of smokingmeans that fingers and possibly dirty cigarettes are in contact with lips,[according to the WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-on-smoking-and-covid-19). Smokers may also already have lung disease or reducedlung capacity which would greatly increase risk of serious illness, the WHOsays.While data is still evolving about how long the virus may remain alive, [arecent study](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/18/heres-how-long-coronavirus-can-live-surfaces-and-air-study/2863287001/) found thatviable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air."
Is cross-country road travel advisable to destinations outside of COVID-19 'hot spots'?,"The White House is asking Americans to stay home as much as possible to slowthe spread of the virus, and some states and local governments have [issued""stay home"" and ""shelter-in-place""orders](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/21/coronavirus-lockdown-orders-shelter-place-stay-home-state-list/2891193001/).""I don’t think now’s the time to do it,"" Elliott said. ""If you have a housesomewhere else, that's fine. But I wouldn’t recommend being in hotels orcrowded public settings. If you want take a road trip and go camping, there'srisk associated with that."""
Can you catch the virus from people who've died?,"The main way the virus is thought to spread is through respiratory dropletsproduced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and this is not a concernafter death, [according to theCDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#anchor_1584390222777).But people should consider not touching the body of someone who has died ofCOVID-19, the CDC says.There is no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral orvisitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19, the CDCsays. Kissing, washing and shrouding should be avoided before, during andafter the body has been prepared, if possible. But holding the hand or huggingafter the body has been prepared for viewing may pose less of a risk, the CDCsays."
What is the value of testing for the coronavirus if there is currently no treatment?,"There is value to getting tested because there are many reasons why someonewould seek medical care for their symptoms, and ruling out the coronavirus ishelpful in seeking other causes, said Jason Christie, chief of pulmonarymedicine at Penn Medicine.""The biggest problem is we don’t have a quick and reliable test right now.Without that, we have to be smart and ration the testing to those people thatneed them most. So don’t go out and get tested right now unless you’re sick,""Christie said.Testing also helps health officials figure out how prevalent and contagious avirus is."
Is it safe to get groceries during senior shopping hour?,"Acknowledging that older adults and persons with underlying health conditionsare more susceptible to COVID-19, a growing number of stores are [dedicatingtime or openingearlier](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/17/coronavirus-shopping-stores-introduce-time-for-vulnerable-elderly-pregnant/5074064002/) for seniorshoppers and other at-risk groups.But Elliott says she doesn't advise it. ""That gives a false sense ofsecurity,"" she said. ""By encouraging older people with chronic diseases to goout at a dedicated time, you're still exposing them to a bunch of otherpeople, and if one person in that crowd is infected, then the virus willspread.""Elliott said she'd rather see stores limiting the number of people who canenter during a given time period so that there are fewer people in the store.She also encourages healthy people to do the shopping."
Can the virus be transmitted through the mail? Should I stop sending greeting cards?,"The chances of transmission through your mail is very low, Elliott says.""Parts of the virus can fall on surfaces and survive on surfaces for up to 72hours. But you have to have pretty good conditions for that to happen. So thelikelihood would be very small, even with no precautions,"" she said.Elliott advises people to put their mail down on a plastic plate instead ofdirectly on a counter top or table, to use a letter opener, and to wash handsthoroughly after touching the mail.Research on how long a virus may live on surfaces is evolving. The CDC hassaid there is likely very low risk of transmission of COVID-19 from productsor packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks ""because of poorsurvivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces.""A [recent study](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/18/heres-how-long-coronavirus-can-live-surfaces-and-air-study/2863287001/) found thatviable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to fourhours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days onplastic and stainless steel. But [a subsequent report from theCDC](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/18/heres-how-long-coronavirus-can-live-surfaces-and-air-study/2863287001/) found that geneticmaterial from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks."
Are plastic grocery bags considered the plastic that you have to wait hours to touch?,"You should take precaution with any containers, Elliott says. ""The plasticgrocery bags I’d throw out right away, wash your hands and then clean yourfood. Chances (of infection) are low,"" she said. ""But better yet, bring yourown bags! It’s better for the environment anyway."""

Is it advantageous for a younger healthy person to get the coronavirus to build immunity to it?,"No, for several reasons, says Peter Hotez, dean of the National School ofTropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.While a protective antibody is generated in those who are infected,[scientists are not yetsure](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/12/coronavirus-reader-questions-answered-symptoms-testing-elderly/5012457002/) whether thatimmunity will last for a short period of time, for years or for life. Some saythe possibility of reinfection is very likely.Moreover, a [new federal health reportsays](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/19/coronavirus-illnesses-can-serious-young-adults-cdc-report/2874271001/) Americans of allages have faced serious health complications amid the outbreak. Data from theCDC show that among the roughly 12% of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. known toneed hospitalizations, about 1 in 5 were among people ages 20 to 44. Anywherefrom 14% to 21% of adults ages 20 to 44 with COVID-19 have been hospitalized,the CDC data estimates. Two to 4% of cases led to ICU admissions, and lessthan 1% were fatal.Finally, it's important to avoid getting and spreading the virus. While theyoung may not be the most at risk, they're carrying the disease to those whoare more vulnerable, such as older people and those with underlyingconditions. Dr. Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, on Wednesday urged ""the millennial generation"" to take specialprecautions. ""You have the potential to spread it,"" she said."
Does getting pneumonia shots given to elderly people help if you get this virus?,"Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilusinfluenzae type B vaccine, do not provide protection against the newcoronavirus, [according to the World HealthOrganization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters).

How soon after exposure can you test positive?,"There's no specific data on this question yet, according to Gregory Poland,director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group. However, we do know thatsomeone infected with the virus may begin showing symptoms anywhere betweenone and 14 days after catching the virus, most commonly around five days,[according to the WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses).""The peak viral shedding occurs during the first five days after the onset ofsymptoms. My guess is that within a few days of being exposed, these patientsare beginning to shed virus,"" Poland said.A recent report from the CDC studying an outbreak at a care home in WashingtonState found that among 23 residents who tested positive for the virus, 13 wereasymptomatic. Within a week, 10 of those 13 developed symptoms, with onset at3 days."
Do the symptoms for COVID-19 come together or can you have separate symptoms showing up at different times?,"The most common symptoms are fever, tiredness and dry cough, according to theWHO. Shortness of breath is also among the most common symptoms, according tothe CDC. In most cases where symptoms present, those symptoms come together,Hotez said.""Usually it presents with fever and cough, or fever, cough, and shortness ofbreath,"" he said.

How do you actually die from the coronavirus?

What is the age range of U.S. deaths from COVID-19?,"In the U.S., ages range from an infant less than one year old to people intheir 90s, according to state and local health departments.The Illinois Department of Public Health said Saturday that [an infantcoronavirus patient younger than one yearold](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/28/coronavirus-update-trump-signs-stimulus-disney-parks-close-indefinitely/2928057001/) in Chicagohad died.

"If a person is sick with the coronavirus and gets tested for the flu, would the flu test be positive?","No, the presence of the coronavirus would not turn a flu test positive.However, it's possible to have both the coronavirus and the flu at the sametime. In that case, the flu test would be positive.The opposite is also true: Presence of the flu would not result in a positivecoronavirus test. It's important to note that, even if someone tests negativefor the coronavirus, they still may be infected with the coronavirus."
I was told I should be tested if I could not easily inhale a large breath and hold it for at least 10 seconds. Is this good advice?,"No. While shortness of breath is among the most common symptoms of the virus,according to the CDC, that diagnosis does not necessarily involve holding alarge breath for 10 seconds. Medically known as dyspnea, shortness of breathis often described as ""an intense tightening in the chest, air hunger,difficulty breathing, breathlessness or a feeling of suffocation,"" accordingto the Mayo Clinic.If you think you may be sick, call your doctor and [follow CDCguidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html)."
Can masks be reused by an infected person or used only once?,"The longer a mask is used and the more damp it becomes, the less effective itis, Poland said. ""But it is definitely better than the alternative of nomask!"""
"If a person tests positive for influenza, they are not tested for coronavirus. Could a person have both?","Yes, a person could have both. This was the case for one patient in China, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 69-year-old man in Wuhan had both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. Doctors initially diagnosed the man with the flu and later diagnosed the coronavirus.

Doctors studying the patient said the case ""suggests that COVID-19 might be underdiagnosed because of false-negative tests for upper respiratory specimens or co-infection with other respiratory viruses. Broader viral testing might be needed.""

Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, agrees.

""I don’t like that people are doing flu tests and saying therefore it’s not coronavirus,"" Hotez said. ""Traditionally, for flu, we know it’s possible to get other co-infectious with other viruses."""
Can testing show if someone has had coronavirus and then recovered?,"Yes, but it depends on what kind of test you do. ""If you do an antibody test, in theory it could show that you had the virus and then recovered,"" Hotez said.

To do an antibody test, you'd need to have blood drawn. But coronavirus tests in the U.S. aren't being done this way."
Is it best to cancel routine doctor and dental appointments?,"Federal health officials are asking Americans to stay home as much as possible and cancel any elective surgeries. Some local and state governments have implemented stricter rules.

If it's possible to keep your appointment and speak with your provider over the phone or video, you should. However, if you cannot speak with a provider remotely and are able to reschedule your in-person appointment for a later date, you should."
What is involved in testing for the coronavirus? Is it the same as when they do a nasal swab for influenza?,"To collect a sample for a diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, doctors typically use the same method of collection as they would for influenza: a nasopharyngeal swab. For this swab, a tiny Q-tip on plastic or a wire stem is put up your nose about 3 or 4 inches.

""I've had it done, and it's mildly uncomfortable for a few seconds,"" said Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group.

A doctor may also do a throat swab. In some cases, if you have a ""wet"" cough, a doctor may also have you cough up some phlegm into a collection cup. These specimen are then packed with ice and shipped to a lab for testing.

To determine if someone has recovered from the coronavirus, at least two different nasal swabs taken at least 24 hours apart must test negative, Poland said."
Should people in their 60s be concerned? Are they considered elderly?,"As with seasonal flu, people at highest risk for severe disease and death include people over the age of 60 and those with underlying conditions, according to the World Health Organization.

""Starting at age 60, there is an increasing risk of disease and the risk increases with age. The highest risk of serious illness and death is in people older than 80 years,"" Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters in a recent telebriefing.

The CDC recommends that people over 60 stock up on supplies, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact, wash hands often, avoid crowds as much as possible, avoid cruises and don't fly on planes unless absolutely necessary."
"How likely are you to die from the virus?
","Of the more than 586,000 people who have been infected worldwide, more than 26,000 have died. That's a death rate of about 4.6%. The WHO has previously estimated the rate at about 3.4%.

The death rate, however, varies widely based on age, health and geographic location. People who are older or who have preexisting conditions are at higher risk of severe illness."
Can someone get the coronavirus more than once?,"Scientists aren't sure yet. For many viruses, including the MERS virus, patients are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover because a protective antibody is generated in those who are infected. But scientists still need to do more research to determine if this is also the case with COVID-19 and how long those antibodies may last.

""However, in certain individuals, the antibody cannot last that long. For many patients who have been cured, there is a likelihood of relapse,"" said Li QinGyuan, director of pneumonia prevention and treatment at China Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing.

Poland agreed, saying the chance of reinfection is ""very likely."""
Are infected people able to transmit the virus to their pets and visa versa?,"No, there is no evidence that pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the WHO.

Last month, the pet dog of a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong tested ""weak"" positive for COVID-19 and was put in quarantine. Scientists concluded that pet cats and dogs can test positive for low levels of the pathogen if they catch it from their owners, but pets can't get sick from the virus."
How long does the virus live on an object like a dollar bill?,"Depending on the type of surface, the virus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, according to the WHO. A recent study by scientists in the U.S. found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. 

However, a subsequent report from the CDC found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks. The CDC found traces of the virus' RNA, not the coronavirus itself, on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship – 17 days after passengers had left the cabins.

It's possible that you can become infected if you touch your face after touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, according to the CDC. But scientists don't think surfaces are the main way that the virus spreads; the most common form of infection is from respiratory droplets spread by a person's cough or sneeze, the CDC reports.

Meanwhile, the WHO says it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. That means the virus cannot spread through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting coronavirus cases.

At the same time, the WHO is reportedly encouraging people to use as many digital payment options as possible. Viruses can survive on hard surfaces like coins for days in some cases. U.S dollars, a blend of fabric and paper, are harder for viruses to stick to."
What is being given to treat the coronavirus once you’ve become infected?,"There is no vaccine for the new virus and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-19, so treatment consists of supportive care to help relieve symptoms and, for severe cases, care to support vital organ functions, the CDC says.

About 80% of people recover from the disease without needing special treatment, according to the WHO. For most patients, that means drinking plenty of fluids and resting, just as you would for the cold or flu."
How many children have been diagnosed with the virus? How many of them have died?,"Among the more than 4,000 cases in the U.S. as of March 16, only 5% were people aged 0–19 years, according to the CDC. Just 2%–3% of cases in that age group had to be hospitalized, and none were in the ICU.

This week, however, health officials reported that a 17-year-old teen in New Orleans died after contracting the virus. And a 2-month-old in Nashville who tested positive for the virus could be the youngest patient in the nation, officials say. In China, at least one two-day-old infant had been infected, according to a WHO study."
"What are dangers to pregnant women?
","It's unclear how the coronavirus may affect pregnant women. In general, pregnant women may experience changes to their body that could make them more susceptible to viral respiratory infections, according to the CDC.

In the case of SARS and MERS, pregnant women were more at risk for severe illness, and some experienced miscarriage and stillbirth, according to the CDC.

There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from an infected mother to her fetus, and, in a limited number of recent cases of infants born to mothers with COVID-19, none of the infants have tested positive for the virus, the CDC said."
Is the presence of a fever always the first symptom of a coronavirus infection? Is there any value in taking your temperature every day?,"Symptoms of COVID-19 resemble the flu and include fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the CDC. Some people also develop aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.

While fever is one of the most common symptoms, it's not productive to take your temperature every day, Poland said.

""That's like taking your blood pressure four times a day for no particular good reason. I’d probably not do that unless there's a reason to do it. For example, if you felt feverish, or if you traveled to a high-risk area, or if you had contact with somebody (infected),"" he said."
How can I know if I have the coronavirus and should go for a test?,"If you have symptoms and want to get tested, the CDC recommends calling your state or local health department or a medical provider.

Not sure if you should get tested? The CDC website features a ""self-checker"" to help you make decisions about seeking medical care. The feature is not intended for the diagnosis or treatment of COVID-19 and is intended only for people in the U.S."
Does testing positive mean that I have the virus and that I will develop symptoms?,"Yes, testing positive means that you have the virus, but it does not mean that you will develop symptoms. Some people who have the virus don't have any symptoms at all.

At the same time, testing negative does not necessarily mean that you don't have the virus."
"There has been a Hong Kong flu, a Swine flu, H1N1, SARS, MERS, Ebola, Zika and other global health threats since the 1960s. How is the coronavirus different?","The current outbreak is the world's first pandemic caused by a coronavirus, a family of virsuses that includes the COVID-19 virus, according to the head of the WHO.

While more people in the U.S. were infected by and died after contracting the flu in 1968 and 2009, the new coronavirus has infected and killed more people in the U.S. than did SARS, MERS, Ebola or Zika.

By comparison, the 1968 ""Hong Kong flu"" pandemic was caused by an influenza A virus and killed an estimated 1 million people worldwide, with about 100,000 deaths in the U.S., according to the CDC. The 2009 ""swine flu"" pandemic was caused by an H1N1 subtype of the influenza A virus and killed at least 151,000 people worldwide during the first year the virus circulated, with more than 12,000 deaths in the U.S., according to the CDC. "
How old was the youngest person to die from the virus?,"A study of more than 72,000 cases in mainland China found that at least one person between ten and 19 years of age had died, but no one younger than ten had died. A subsequent study in the journal Pediatrics found that a 14-year-old boy from China died in February after contracting the coronavirus.

It was not immediately clear if anyone younger had died elsewhere in the world.

By comparison, at least 155 children in the U.S. have died after contracting the flu so far this flu season, according to the CDC."
什么是新型冠状病毒？,"新型冠状病毒是一种此前尚未确定的新冠状病毒。导致新型冠状病毒肺炎 | 新冠肺炎2019（COVID-19）的病毒不同于在人类中普遍传播并仅引起轻度疾病的冠状病毒，例如普通感冒。 
冠状病毒  229E、NL63、OC43 或 HKU1 的诊断与 COVID-19 的诊断不同。COVID-19 患者将接受不同于常见冠状病毒确诊患者的评估和护理。"
为什么这种疾病被称为 2019 年新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）？,"2020 年 2 月 11 日，世界卫生组织宣布了导致最初于中国武汉发现的 2019 年新型冠状病毒爆发的疾病官方名称。该疾病的新名称是新型冠状病毒肺炎2019，缩写为 COVID-19。在 COVID-19 中，“CO”代表“冠状”、“VI”代表“病毒”，以及“D”代表“疾病”。该疾病此前被称为“2019 年新型冠状病毒”或“2019-nCoV”。 
人类冠状病毒有很多种，其中一些通常导致轻度上呼吸道疾病。COVID-19是一种由此前尚未在人体中发现的新型（或新的）冠状病毒引起的新疾病。此疾病名称根据世界卫生组织（WHO）新型人类传染疾病命名最佳实践external iconexternal icon而定。  "
为什么有人会因为 COVID-19 而指责或躲避某些个人和群体（制造污名）？,"美国民众可能对住在或前往COVID-19传播地区的亲友感到担心焦虑。有些人很担心通过这些人感染疾病。恐惧和焦虑会导致社会污名化的产生，例如，针对居住在世界某些地方的人、曾在国外旅行的人、曾被隔离的人或医疗护理专业人员。
污名是对可识别的某一人群、地区或国家的歧视。污名化的产生主要是由于缺乏对 COVID-19 的传播方式的认识、指责旁人的欲望、对疾病和死亡的恐惧，以及谣言和谬论的散播。
污名化会伤害到每一个人，因为它使人们对普通民众产生更多的恐惧或愤怒，而并非将注意力放在引起问题的疾病本身。"
人们如何制止与 COVID-19 相关的污名化？,在注意到污名化正在发生的情况下，人们可以通过提供社会支持来对抗污名化。污名会影响被污名化群体及其所在社区的情绪或心理健康。停止污名化对于社区和社区成员的抗压能力很重要。查看有关COVID-19疫情期间的心理健康和应对措施的资源。每个人都可以通过了解事实并与社区中的人分享来帮助阻止有关COVID-19的污名化。   
为何某些州的COVID-19病例数量有时与CDC网站上发布的数量有差别？,CDC发布的总病例数量依照各辖区的确认程序得以验证。不同的地方所显示的病例数量的发现和确认程序可能有所不同。
CDC发布的COVID-19病例数量与世界卫生组织（WHO）或约翰霍普金斯大学提供的数量有何异同？,CDC发布的COVID-19病例数量包含很多公开报告的数量，包括来自州、地方、领地、国际和外部合作伙伴的信息。
为何过去几天的病例数量出现了增长？,报告的延迟可能导致过去几天中报告的COVID-19病例数量发生增长。（有时称这种效应为“回填”。）州、地方和领地卫生部门会报告已确认的病例数量，并与CDC分享这些数据。由于开展实验室测试需要一些时间，之前某一天的病例可能会在几天后增加到当天的统计数量中。
这种病毒的来源是什么？,COVID-19由名为SARS-CoV-2的冠状病毒引起。冠状病毒是人类和许多不同的动物（包括骆驼、牛、猫和蝙蝠）身上常见的一大类病毒。在极少情况下动物冠状病毒能够感染人类，然后在人与人之间传播。这曾发生在MERS-CoV和SARS-CoV上，而现在又发生在引发COVID-19的病毒上。有关COVID-19来源和传播的更多信息参见疫情概况：病毒的来源和传播。    
病毒如何传播？,"引发COVID-19的病毒被认为主要以人传人的方式，通过感染患者咳嗽或打喷嚏时产生的呼吸道飞沫进行传播。这些飞沫可能附着到附近的人的嘴巴或鼻子上，或者可能被吸入肺部。当人们近距离接触时（约6英尺以内）传播的可能性更高。
COVID-19在很多受影响地区的社区中似乎可以轻易且持续地传播（“社区传播”）。社区传播意味着人们已经在某个地区感染了这种病毒，其中包括不确定自己是在何处或如何受到感染的人。 
了解新发冠状病毒已知信息。 "
为什么出现病例上升？,美国所报告COVID-19病例数量由于实验室检测增加和全国报告而增加。病例数的增加部分地反映了COVID-19随着美国各州和领地出现社区传播而快速传播。更详细和准确的数据让我们可以更好地理解和追踪疫情爆发规模和范围，进而强化预防和应对工作。  
COVID-19 患者会将疾病传播给其他人吗？,"引发COVID-19的病毒正在人际间传播。人们出现症状时（病情最严重）被认为传染性最高。因此CDC建议这类患者在医院或家中隔离（取决于病情），直至病情好转，不再有传染他人的风险。最近在无症状者中也检测到了病毒。 
患者的病毒活跃时间可能有所不同。因此，解除隔离的时间亦因人而异，需要采取基于检测或不基于检测的策略（即疾病开始后经过的时间以及恢复后经过的时间），与各州和本地公共卫生官员磋商决定，其中应考虑病情严重程度、疾病体征和症状，以及患者的实验室测试结果。
详细了解CDC关于何时可以解除隔离以及准许因COVID-19住院治疗的患者出院的指南。如需了解COVID-19患者何时能够停止居家隔离，请参阅关于COVID-19患者中止居家隔离的临时指南。  
解除隔离的人通常不会对他人构成感染风险。"
因 COVID-19 原因而被隔离的人会将疾病传播给他人吗？,隔离是指将曾经接触到传染性疾病、但尚未发生疾病（症状）的个人或群体与未接触到该疾病的其他人分开，以防止该疾病传播的可能。隔离通常根据传染病的潜伏期而确立，而潜伏期是指相关人员从接触病毒到发病的时间范围。COVID-19的隔离期为自最后一次接触之日起的14天，因为此病毒的潜伏期为2至14天。COVID-19的解除隔离人群通常不具有将病毒传播给他人的风险，因为他们在隔离期间没有发病。
引发COVID-19的病毒会通过食物（包括餐馆外卖食物、冷藏或冷冻包装食品）传播吗？,"一般认为，冠状病毒是通过呼吸道飞沫在人与人之间传播的。目前尚无证据支持COVID-19传播与食物相关。在备餐或进食之前，请务必用肥皂和清水洗手至少20秒，以确保一般性食品安全。每次咳嗽或打喷嚏时使用纸巾遮掩，并且每次擤鼻涕、咳嗽、打喷嚏或如厕后请务必洗手。
人们也可能通过接触沾染病毒的表面或物体（例如包装容器）然后触摸自己的眼口鼻而感染COVID-19，但这并非该病毒传播的主要方式。
一般而言，冠状病毒在表面上的存活性较差，因此通过食品或包装传播风险很低。
了解有关COVID-19 传播的已知信息。 "
如果食物上有病毒，我是否会感染COVID-19？,基于迄今为止了解到的有关此新型冠状病毒的信息，COVID-19似乎不会通过食物传播，但仍需要进一步的调查方可确认。
温暖的天气会阻止 COVID-19 的爆发吗？,尚不清楚天气和温度是否会影响COVID-19的传播。其他一些其他病毒（如普通感冒和流感）在冬季寒冷天气中传播性更强，但这并不意味着在其他季节就没有感染病毒的风险。有关COVID-19的传播性、严重性和其他特性的知识还需进一步了解，目前仍在调查研究。
什么是社区传播？,社区传播意味着人们已经在某个地区感染了这种病毒，其中包括不确定自己是在何处如何受到感染的人。
杀死COVID-19病毒的温度是什么？,一般而言，冠状病毒在高温高湿的环境中存活的时间比在凉爽干燥的环境中更短。但是，我们目前还没有关于此病毒的直接数据，也没有基于温度的失活截止时间的直接数据。必要的温度也应基于表面的材料和环境等因素。无论温度条件如何，均请遵守CDC的清洁和消毒指南。 
蚊子或扁虱是否能够传播COVID-19病毒？,CDC目前还没有数据表明这种新型冠状病毒或其类似的冠状病毒会通过蚊子或扁虱传播。COVID-19传播的主要方式为人传人。参看冠状病毒如何传播，获取更多信息。

如果我与COVID-19患者有过密切接触该怎么办？,可从网上获取关于COVID-19确诊人员或被检测人员近距离接触人员的信息。 
CDC是否建议使用口罩或布制面罩来预防COVID-19？,鉴于有关COVID-19传播方式的新数据，以及在全国各地社区中广泛传播的COVID-19疾病的相关证据，CDC建议人们在社区环境中佩戴布制面罩遮掩口鼻。这是人们为了减少COVID-19的传播应当采取的另一项公共卫生措施，补充（而非替代）保持社交距离、经常清洁手部和其他日常预防措施。布制面罩并非用于保护佩戴者，而是可以防止佩戴者将病毒传播给他人。这对于无症状感染者而言尤为重要。如果某人必须进入公共场所（例如杂货店），则应佩戴布制面罩。依照CDC现行指南中的建议，医用口罩和N-95口罩应留给医护人员和其他应急响应者使用。 
从中国寄出的包裹或产品会有传播 COVID-19 的风险吗？,有关COVID-19及其传播方式，我们目前仍知之甚少。一般认为，此冠状病毒最主要通过呼吸飞沫传播。尽管此病毒在某些表面上能够存活一段较短的时间，但其不太可能通过在环境温度下已装运数天或数周的产品或包装进行传播。目前没有证据能够证明与进口商品相关的COVID-19传播，而美国也没有任何COVID-19病例与进口商品有关。已获得的相关信息将发布在新型冠状病毒肺炎|新冠病毒2019（COVID-19）网站上。 
我可以献血吗？,在美国各地的医疗设施中，献血对于照护病人和拯救生命至关重要。对献血的需求持续存在，而各血液中心也均已开放，并亟需献血。CDC鼓励身体健康的人们在条件允许时继续献血，即使其由于COVID-19正在保持社交距离也可以献血。CDC通过提供有助于保证献血者和血液中心工作人员安全的建议来为献血中心提供支持。这些建议的例子包括将献血者座椅相互间隔6英尺、严格遵守环境清洁规范，并鼓励献血者提前预约献血。
隐形眼镜佩戴者应采取特殊预防措施预防COVID-19吗？,"

当前没有证据表明隐形眼镜佩戴者比框架眼睛佩戴者感染COVID-19的风险更高。
隐形眼镜佩戴者应继续采取隐形眼镜佩戴和护理卫生习惯，有利于预防隐形眼镜相关的传染传播，例如总是在接触镜片前用肥皂和水洗手。 
健康人员仍可继续根据眼部护理专业人员的指示佩戴和护理其隐形眼镜。

儿童和成人的COVID-19症状不同吗？,没有不同。COVID-19症状在儿童和成人身上表现类似。但是，确诊COVID-19的儿童通常表现出轻微症状。儿童身上的报告症状包括类似感冒的症状，例如发烧、流鼻涕和咳嗽。也曾报告出现过呕吐和腹泻。一些儿童是否重症风险更高还未可知，例如，存在基础疾病和特殊医疗护理需求的儿童。关于这个疾病对儿童的影响，还有很多未知。
儿童应该戴口罩吗？,"CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community. Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation. Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms. Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance."
如何让我的孩子做好准备以应对所在社区中的COVID-19疫情爆发？,疫情爆发可能对成人和儿童造成精神压力。与您的孩子讨论疫情爆发，试着保持冷静并向他们保证他们很安全。如果合适的话，可向其解释COVID-19的大多数病情似乎都较轻。儿童对压力情况的反应与成人不同。CDC提供了一些资源以帮助家长与孩子谈论COVID-19。  
家长应采取哪些措施以便在社区疫情爆发时保护孩子？,"这是一种新型病毒，我们目前仍在了解的过程中。不过到目前为止，儿童病例似乎不太多。大多数病症，包括重症，都发生在工作年龄的成年人和老年人身上。但是，儿童的确会感染病毒并生病。全国各地很多学校均已宣布暂时停课。请随时关注您所在社区的学校停课通知。阅读或观看报告学校停课情况的当地媒体资源。如果学校临时停课，可以在需要时使用替代的儿童照护方案。
如果您的孩子感染COVID-19，通知其幼儿园或学校。与老师讨论课堂作业以及他们可以在家做的活动，以跟上学业进度。
阻止儿童和青少年在学校停课期间在其他公共场所聚集，帮助减缓社区COVID-19传播。"
学校停课期间，我的孩子可以和朋友一起出去玩吗？,"

减缓COVID-19传播的关键是保持社交距离。学校停课时，儿童不应与其他家庭的孩子见面一起玩耍。如果儿童在自己家外面玩耍，他们必须与家庭以外的其他人保持6英尺距离。
在保持社交距离期间，帮助孩子维持社交联系，让他们在您的监督下跟朋友打电话或视频通话。
确保孩子养成日常预防习惯，比如经常用肥皂和水洗手。请记住，如果孩子们在校外集体聚会，可能会将每个人都置于危险之中。  
如果春假计划包括非必要旅行，更改计划。


有关儿童感染COVID-19的信息较为有限，但目前的数据表明，患有COVID-19的儿童可能只表现出轻微症状。然而，他们仍然可能将这种病毒传播给其他高危人群，包括老年人和患有严重基础疾病的人群。

我应使用何种清洁产品来预防感染COVID-19？,对频繁接触表面进行清洁和消毒，例如桌子、门把手、电灯开关、台面、扶手、书桌、电话、键盘、马桶、水龙头和水槽。如果表面有脏污，消毒之前先使用清洁剂或肥皂和水进行清洁。大多数EPA注册的常见家用消毒剂均可有效地用于消毒。查看CDC关于家庭清洁和消毒的建议。  
如果无法在商店中买到免洗手消毒液，我应该自己制作吗？,"


CDC推荐用肥皂和水洗手至少20秒，或者在没有肥皂和水可用时，使用含至少60%酒精的免洗手部消毒液。这些均为个人可以采取的日常预防措施，以减缓呼吸系统疾病（如COVID-19）的传播。 

洗手时，您可以使用普通肥皂或抗菌肥皂。普通肥皂跟抗菌肥皂一样可以有效移除细菌。
如果没有肥皂和水可用，您可以使用FDA批准的含至少60%酒精的免洗手消毒液。您可以通过产品标签确定该免洗手消毒液酒精含量是否达到60%。 

出于对原料正确使用的担忧external iconexternal icon 以及需要在无菌环境下操作的要求，CDC不建议制作和使用自制手部消毒液产品。本地行业正在寻求生产免洗手消毒液，以填补市场商品短缺，参见 世界卫生组织指南pdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon。一旦可以买到这些产品补给后，各组织应转而使用商业生产的、FDA批准的产品。  

为有效杀灭一些类型的致病微生物，免洗手消毒液需要至少60%的酒精含量并在手部没有明显脏污或油污的情况下使用。  
不要依赖主要基于精油或没有正确混合操作的“自己制作”或“自制”配方。
请勿使用免洗手消毒液为频繁接触表面和物体消毒。参见CDC关于家庭清洁和消毒的信息。

如果我所在社区爆发了疫情，我应该怎么做？,"在疫情爆发期间，您应保持冷静并实施您的应对计划。采取下列措施：
保护您和他人。

如果您已生病，请待在家中。远离生病的人。尽可能限制与他人之间的近距离接触（约6英尺）。

实施您的家庭计划。

随时关注当地COVID-19最新疫情。关注您所在地区的学校临时停课通知，因为这可能影响您家庭的日常生活。


继续执行每日预防措施。咳嗽和打喷嚏时用纸巾遮住，并经常用肥皂和水洗手20秒以上。如果没有肥皂和水，使用含60%酒精的免洗手消毒液。使用日常家用清洁剂和水每天清洁频繁接触的表面和物体。
如果您的固定工作时间表发生了变动，请尽快通知您的工作场所。如果您或您的某位家人出现了COVID-19症状，或者您孩子的学校暂时停课，可要求在家里工作或请假。了解企业和雇主可以如何针对COVID-19制定计划并进行应对。  
通过电话或电子邮件与他人保持联系。如果您存在慢性健康问题并独自居住，可请家人、朋友和医务人员在疫情爆发期间定期查看您的情况。与家人和朋友保持联系，特别是重病风险较高人群，例如老年人和存在严重的慢性健康问题的人群。 

"
如果我所在社区爆发了疫情，学校是否将停课？,取决于具体的情况，公共卫生官员可能建议社区采取行动以减少与COVID-19的接触，例如学校停课。阅读或观看报告学校停课情况的当地媒体资源，并关注您孩子所在学校的通信。如果学校临时停课，请阻止学生和教职员工前往任何地方聚会或社交，例如朋友的家、最喜欢的餐厅或当地的购物中心。
如果我所在社区爆发了疫情，我是否应继续上班？,遵守您当地的卫生官员的建议。尽可能待在家中。与您的雇主讨论可否在在家办公。如果您或您的某位家人出现了COVID-19症状，或者您孩子的学校暂时停课，可向雇主请假。雇主应认识到，在社区疫情爆发期间，可能更多员工需要待在家中照看生病的孩子或其他生病的家庭成员。 
我社区内的企业和学校会关闭或保持关闭吗？持续多长时间？我的社区内是否会有“居家”或“住处避难”命令？,"CDC提出建议、分享信息并提供指南，以帮助减缓COVID-19在美国传播，其中包括针对学校和企业的指南。CDC定期向州、地方、领地和部落卫生部门分享信息并提供协助。这些地方部门负责进行包括“居家”或“住处避难”的决策。这些命令中的内容及其执行方式均由当地有关部门决定。这些决策还可能取决于很多因素，例如特定社区的病毒如何传播。
请联系您的当地卫生部门获取更多信息。 "
COVID-19 会引发哪些症状和并发症？,据目前报道，COVID-19 患者的症状包括轻度至重度呼吸道疾病，伴有发烧1、咳嗽和呼吸困难。了解更多 COVID-19 症状。 
我应该接受 COVID-19 检测吗？,不是每个人都需要进行COVID-19检测。获取更多关于检测的信息，参见COVID-19检测。 
我去哪里接受COVID-19检测？,每个地方的检测流程和地点都不一样。联系您的州、本地、部落或领地相关部门获取更多信息，或联系医疗卫生提供者。州和本地公共卫生部门已经收到了来自CDC的检测工具，而医疗卫生提供者的检测工具来自商业生产商。虽然这些检测的供给在增加，但要找到获得检测的地方可能还是很困难。查看COVID-19检测获取更多信息。 
一个人有可能在检测为 COVID-19 阴性之后又被检测出呈阳性吗？,"使用 CDC 开发的诊断检测，结果为阴性是指在受测者样本中未发现导致 COVID-19 的病毒。在感染的早期阶段，有可能检测不到病毒。
对于 COVID-19，一个人在出现症状时所采集的样本的检测结果为阴性可能意味着当前疾病并非由 COVID-19 病毒引起。"
哪些人的 COVID-19 重症风险较高？,"COVID-19是一种新出现的疾病，目前有关导致严重疾病的风险因素信息很少。基于目前可获得的信息以及临床专业知识，老年人以及患有严重基础疾病的各年龄段人群因为COVID-19而患上重病的风险可能较高。  
据我们目前所知，COVID-19 重病的高危人群有：

65岁及以上的人士
住在养老院或长期护理设施的人群

各年龄段有基础疾病的人，尤其是未得到良好控制的人，包括：

慢性肺病或中度至重度哮喘的患者
严重心脏病患者
免疫功能低下的人 
有多种情况会导致患者免疫功能低下，包括癌症治疗、抽烟、骨髓或器官移植、免疫缺陷、HIV或AIDS病情控制不当，以及长时间服用类固醇或其他有损免疫功能的药物


严重肥胖人士（体重指数[BMI] ≥40）
糖尿病患者
正在接受透析的慢性肾病患者
肝病患者

"
COVID-19 重症风险较高的人该怎么办？,"如果您为COVID-19重症高风险人群，您应：

储备物资
采取日常预防措施，与他人保持距离
外出到公共场所时，请远离生病的人
限制近距离接触，并经常洗手
避免人群、邮轮旅行和非必要旅行

如果您所在的社区爆发疫情，请尽量留在家中。观察是否出现症状和重症体征。如果生病，请留在家中并致电您的医生。您可参阅COVID-19重症高风险人群，了解有关如何准备、生病后如何应对以及社区和护理人员如何为高风险人群提供支持的更多信息。 "
属于COVID-19重症高风险人群的基础疾病是如何筛选的？,"此列表基于：

我们通过其他国家和美国爆发的疫情所了解到的情况。
我们已知的其他呼吸道感染（例如流感）的风险情况。

随着CDC逐步获得有关美国COVID-19病例的更多信息，我们将在必要时更新此列表。"
如果我感染了COVID-19需要避免服用什么药物？,"
当前，没有证据表明服用布洛芬或萘普生会导致更严重的COVID-19感染情况。
患有高血压的人群应遵医嘱服用降压药，并应配合医生使血压尽量得到控制。任何有关药物的变更只应通过您的医疗提供方完成。
"
应如何看待此列表中未包含的潜在健康问题？,"基于可获得的信息，65岁及以上的成年人以及存在此列表中包含的基础疾病的各年龄段人士因为COVID-19而患上重病的风险较高，且预后不乐观。CDC正在定期收集和分析数据，并将在了解到更多信息后更新此列表。存在此列表中未包含的基础疾病的人士也同样可能面临着较高的风险，如对此有疑虑可以咨询医务人员。
我们建议所有人（无论是否存在风险）都应：

采取措施保护您自己和他人。 
如果您生病并伴有发烧、咳嗽或气短，致电您的医疗卫生提供者。  
遵循CDC的旅行指南以及您所在州和地方卫生官员的建议。 

"
控制良好的健康状况是什么意思？,一般而言，得到良好控制意味着您的状况稳定、无生命威胁，并且实验室评估和其他检验结果与不存在健康问题者很相似。如果您对自己的健康或者目前管理自己健康状况的方式存在疑问，则应与医务人员交谈。
更严重疾病是什么意思？,严重程度一般指疾病或健康问题对您身体机能的影响程度。如果您对自己的健康或者目前管理自己健康状况的方式存在疑问，则应与医务人员交谈。
残疾人是否面临着更高的风险？,"从本质上而言，大多数残疾人感染COVID-19或由此患上重病的风险并不会比一般人更高。某些存在身体缺陷或其他残疾的人由于患有基础疾病而可能面临着更高的感染风险。

某些残疾人可能更容易出现慢性健康问题，从而使其更容易因为COVID-19而患上重症，并且预后不佳。成年残疾人患上心脏病、中风、糖尿病或癌症的概率是没有残疾的成年人的三倍。

如果您对自己的健康或者目前管理自己健康状况的方式存在疑问，则应与医务人员交谈。"
医疗护理专业人员和卫生部门应该怎么做？,获取关于被调查人员；感染控制，包括个人防护用品指南；居家护理和隔离；以及病例调查相关的建议和指南，参见医疗护理专业人员信息。有关样本采集和运输的信息，参见实验室信息。有关 COVID-19 公共卫生专业人员的信息，参见公共卫生专业人员信息。   
如果我参加了 COVID-19 死亡患者的葬礼或探视，我会有风险吗？,目前尚不清楚在葬礼或探视中与 COVID-19 死亡患者同处一室是否存在风险。
如果我触碰了 COVID-19 死亡患者的遗体，我会有风险吗？,"COVID-19 是一种新的疾病， 我们仍在了解它的传播方式。一般认为，导致 COVID-19 的病毒主要是通过与正在患有 COVID-19 的人士密切接触（即约 6 英尺内）传播。这种病毒可能主要通过感染者咳嗽或打喷嚏时产生的呼吸道飞沫传播，类似于流感和其他呼吸道感染的传播方式。这些飞沫可能落在附近人群的口鼻处，或者被吸入肺部。因此，患者死后不会造成飞沫传播。 
人们可能会在接触了带有病毒的表面或物体之后又触摸自己的口鼻或眼部，并因此感染 COVID-19，但这并不是该病毒的主要传播方式。
我们不建议人们接触COVID-19死亡患者的遗体。老年人和患有严重基础疾病的各年龄段人群发生COVID-19重症的风险更高。这种病毒通过某些接触传播的可能性较小，例如在遗体满足探视条件的情况下握手或拥抱。如果可以，应在遗体处理完成之前、期间和之后避免其他活动，例如接吻、净身和裹布。如果净身或裹布是重要的宗教或文化习俗，建议家庭借助所在社区的文化和宗教领袖以及殡仪馆工作人员的帮助，尽量减少接触。从事殡仪活动的人员至少应戴一次性手套。如预计会有液体溅出，则还需佩戴其他个人防护设备（PPE）（例如一次性防护服、面罩或护目镜和N-95呼吸器）。
应根据所有清洁和消毒产品制造商指示（例如浓度、使用方法和接触时间）进行清洁。对于更难以杀灭的病毒，基于相关数据，由EPA批准的新发病毒性病原体产品pdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon据预测对于COVID-19病毒有效。脱掉PPE后，用肥皂和水洗手至少20秒，或者没有肥皂和水可用时，使用含至少60%酒精的免洗手消毒液保持手部卫生。如果双手明显脏污，应使用肥皂和水。  "
殡仪馆工作人员在处理COVID-19死者时应该具备哪些知识？,"COVID-19患者病逝后可以举行葬礼和吊唁活动。在承接COVID-19逝者葬礼时，殡仪馆工作人员应遵守其常规传染预防和控制措施。如果需要将尸体装入尸袋，遵循标准预防措施，包括为预计可能出现的液体飞溅准备的额外个人防护用品（PPE）。对于运输装袋后的尸体，使用EPA批准适用于新发病毒性病原体的产品pdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon对尸袋外部进行消毒，因为根据耐受病毒的数据，这些产品预计会对COVID-19病毒有效。使用所有清洁和消毒产品时，遵循制造商指示（包括浓度、使用方法和接触时间等）。处理尸袋时，戴上一次性丁腈手套。  
可进行尸体防腐处理。尸体防腐期间，遵守标准预防措施，包括如果预计出现飞溅，使用额外PPE（例如一次性罩袍、面罩和N95口罩）。如果任何程序会产生气溶胶或者如果需要根据制造商标签使用化学品，穿戴相应的呼吸道防护用品。如果存在割伤、刺伤或其他破坏皮肤的伤害风险，穿戴重型手套而非一次性丁腈手套。关于如何安全进行产生气溶胶的程序相关更多信息，参见CDC尸检指南。清洁应根据制造商指示进行。根据来自更耐受病毒的数据，EPA批准适用于新发病毒性病原体的产品pdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon预计对COVID-19病毒有效。遵循制造商指示使用所有清洁和消毒产品（包括浓度、使用方法和接触时间）。  
清洁并脱卸 PPE 后，使用肥皂和清水洗手至少 20 秒，或者如果没有肥皂和水，使用含至少 60%酒精的免洗手消毒液，保持手部卫生。如果手部有明显污渍，则应使用肥皂和水洗手。 
可以对 COVID-19 死亡患者的遗体进行掩埋或火化，但是应检查州及地方政府是否对处理和处置某些传染病死亡患者遗体有其他要求。"
如果我的家人在国外因 COVID-19 而死亡，该怎么办？,美国公民在美国境外死亡时，死者的近亲或法定代理人应通知美国国务院的美国领事官员。领事人员每周 7 天，每天 24 小时为美国公民提供海外紧急援助。如果死者的家庭成员、伴侣或法定代理人与死者不在同一国家，则应于东部时间周一至周五的上午 8 至下午 5 致电华盛顿特区的美国国务院海外公民服务办公室，电话为 888-407-4747（免费电话）或 202-501-4444 。如需在工作时间以外或周末和节假日寻求紧急援助，请拨打 202-647-4000 致电美国国务院总机，并要求与海外公民服务值班人员通话。此外，美国公民死亡地国家内或离该国最近的美国大使馆external iconexternal iconexternal icon可以提供帮助。 
如果我的家人在国外因 COVID-19 而死亡，要将遗体运回美国有什么要求？,"海外死者的遗体在运回美国之前，CDC 不要求进行尸检。根据死亡的具体情况，有些国家可能要求进行尸检。死者家庭可以向当地领事馆或大使馆、旅行保险提供商、旅行社，宗教组织和援助组织以及死者的雇主寻求支持。期间您可能需要提供死者身份正式鉴定和领事馆签发的官方文件。
CDC 对运送遗体回国的要求取决于遗体是否经过防腐处理、火化，或死者是否死于检疫传染病。 
目前，COVID-19 在美国属于检疫传染病，死者遗体必须符合《美国联邦法规法典》 第42 篇第 71.55 部分中的运回标准，并且必须满足以下情况才可批准、放行和授权遗体进入美国：

遗体已经过火化；或
遗体已经过适当的防腐处理，且置于密封棺材中；或
遗体附有 CDC 主任签发的许可证。遗体在运送期间必须始终随附 CDC 许可证（如适用）。
可以通过 CDC 全球移民与检疫处获得检疫传染病确诊或疑似患者遗体的运回许可证，请拨打 770-488-7100 联系 CDC 紧急应变中心或发送电子邮件至 dgmqpolicyoffice@cdc.gov。

CDC 为应对 COVID-19 采取了哪些措施？,CDC正与其他联邦合作伙伴一起提供全政府疫情应对。这是一个新发、快速发展的疫情，而CDC将继续提供最新信息。CDC24/7会尽一切力量保护人们的健康。更多关于CDC应对COVID-19疫情的信息可从线上获得。 
宠物或其他动物是否会使我感染COVID-19？,"当前，美国国内还没有证据表明陪伴动物，包括宠物，可以传播COVID-19给人类或者它们可能成为传染源。截至目前，CDC还没有收到美国宠物感染COVID-19的报告。
其他类型的冠状病毒可能使宠物生病，例如犬冠状病毒和猫冠状病毒。这些其他类型的冠状病毒无法传染人，并且与当前的COVID-19疫情爆发无关。
但是，由于动物可以向人传播其他疾病，在与宠物和其他动物相处时保持健康的习惯是明智的做法，例如洗手并保持良好卫生。如需详细了解拥有宠物的众多好处，以及在与宠物、牲畜和野生动物相处时如何保持安全和健康，请访问CDC的“健康的宠物，健康的人”网站。  "
我需要给我的宠物检测COVID-19吗？,没有。目前不建议为动物进行COVID-19检测。
动物皮肤或皮毛会携带COVID-19病毒吗？,"目前，没有证据表明COVID-19病毒会从宠物的皮肤或皮毛传播给人类。
关于照顾宠物的最佳方法，请咨询兽医。"
如果我感染了 COVID-19，我应该避免接触宠物或其他动物吗？,在您感染COVID-19时，应限制与宠物和其他动物之间的接触，正如应避免接触其他人一样。尽管还没有宠物感染COVID-19的报告，我们仍建议COVID-19患者限制与宠物的接触，直至获得有关此新型冠状病毒的更多信息。如果可能的话，在您患病期间让您家中的其他成员照顾您的动物。如果您患有COVID-19，请避免接触您的宠物，包括爱抚、依偎、被宠物亲吻或舔，以及共享食物。如果您在患病期间必须照顾自己的宠物或与宠物接触，请在与宠物互动之前和之后洗手。
收养动物收容所的宠物安全吗？,没有理由认为任何动物，包括收容所宠物，可能是美国的一个COVID-19来源。
从国外进口的动物或动物产品有问题吗？,CDC 没有任何证据表明，进口的动物或动物产品有在美国传播 COVID-19 的风险。疫情局势发展迅速，我们将不断更新最新信息。美国疾病控制与预防中心（CDC）、美国农业部（USDA）和美国鱼类及野生动物管理局（FWS）在监管向美国进口活体动物和动物产品方面发挥着独特但互补的作用。CDC 监管对人类健康构成威胁的动物和动物产品，USDA 监管external iconexternal icon 对农业构成威胁的动物和动物产品；FWS 监管external iconexternal icon可能会对人类健康福利、农业、园艺或林业利益以及野生动物资源生存与福利造成危害的濒危物种和野生动物的进口。

What is a novel coronavirus?,"A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis."
"Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?","On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases."
Why might someone blame or avoid individuals and groups (create stigma) because of COVID-19?,"People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem."
How can people help stop stigma related to COVID-19?,People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring. Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient. See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19. Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.
Why do some state’s COVID-19 case numbers sometimes differ from what is posted on CDC’s website?,CDC’s overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with jurisdictions. The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by different places may differ.
How do CDC’s COVID-19 case numbers compare with those provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) or Johns Hopkins?,"CDC’s COVID-19 case numbers include many publicly reported numbers, including information from state, local, territorial, international and external partners."
Why do the number of cases for previous days increase?,"Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase. (Sometimes this effect is described as “backfill.”) State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC. Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late."
What is the source of the virus?,"COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.  Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people. This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus."
How does the virus spread?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in many affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses."
Why are we seeing a rise in cases?,The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country. The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread. More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
Can someone who has had COVID-19 spread the illness to others?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest). That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e. time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials. The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.
Learn more about CDC’s guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19. For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others."
Can someone who has been quarantined for COVID-19 spread the illness to others?,"Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period."
"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be spread through food, including restaurant take out, refrigerated or frozen packaged food?","Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.
Learn what is known about the spread of COVID-19."
Can I get sick with COVID-19 if it is on food?,"Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed."
Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?,"It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing."
What is community spread?,"Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected."
What temperature kills the virus that causes COVID-19?,"Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments. However, we don’t have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point. The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc. Regardless of temperature please follow CDC’s guidance for cleaning and disinfection."
Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19?,"At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person. See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information."
Am I at risk for COVID-19 in the United States?,This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily. The latest updates are available on CDC’s Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
How many cases have been reported in the United States?,COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online. See the current U.S. case count of COVID-19.
How can I help protect myself?,"Visit the COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19."
What should I do if I have had close contact with someone who has COVID-19?,"There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online."
Does CDC recommend the use of facemask or face coverings to prevent COVID-19?,"In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting. This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms. A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example). Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance."
Am I at risk for COVID-19 from a package or products shipping from China?,"There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. This coronaviruses is thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods.

Is it okay for me to donate blood?,"In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time."
Should contact lens wearers take special precautions to prevent COVID-19?,"

Currently there is no evidence to suggest contact lens wearers are more at risk for acquiring COVID-19 than eyeglass wearers.
Contact lens wearers should continue to practice safe contact lens wear and care hygiene habits to help prevent against transmission of any contact lens-related infections, such as always washing hands with soap and water before handling lenses.
People who are healthy can continue to wear and care for their contact lenses as prescribed by their eye care professional.

Visit CDC’s contact lens website for more information on healthy contact lens wear and care."
Is contact lens disinfecting solution effective against COVID-19?,"

Hydrogen peroxide-based systems for cleaning, disinfecting, and storing contact lenses should be effective against the virus that causes COVID-19.

For other disinfection methods, such as multipurpose solution and ultrasonic cleaners, there is currently not enough scientific evidence to determine efficacy against the virus.


Always use solution to disinfect your contact lenses and case to kill germs that may be present.
Handle your lenses over a surface that has been cleaned and disinfected.

What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?,"Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at People who are at higher risk for severe illness."
How can I protect my child from COVID-19 infection?,"You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.
Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throw the tissue in the trash.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects (e.g., tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles).
Launder items, including washable plush toys, as appropriate and in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry from an ill person can be washed with other people’s items.

You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities. Additional information on how COVID-19 is spread is available at How COVID-19 Spreads.
More information on Children and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is available online."
Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than in adults?,"No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. It’s not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children."
Should children wear masks?,"CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community. Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation. Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms. Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance."
How do I prepare my children in case of COVID-19 outbreak in our community?,"Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe. If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild. Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults. CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19."
What steps should parents take to protect children during a community outbreak?,"This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. However, children do get the virus and become ill. Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community."
"While school’s out, can my child hang out with their friends?","

The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. While school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households. If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household.
To help children maintain social connections while social distancing, help your children have supervised phone calls or video chats with their friends.
Make sure children practice everyday preventive behaviors, such as washing their hands often with soap and water. Remember, if children meet outside of school in groups, it can put everyone at risk.

Revise spring break plans if they included non-essential travel.


Information about COVID-19 in children is somewhat limited, but current data suggest children with COVID-19 may have only mild symptoms. However, they can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk, including older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions.

"
"While school’s out, how can I help my child continue learning?","

Stay in touch with your child’s school.

Many schools are offering lessons online (virtual learning). Review assignments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers.
Communicate challenges to your school. If you face technology or connectivity issues, or if your child is having a hard time completing assignments, let the school know.


Create a schedule and routine for learning at home, but remain flexible.

Have consistent bedtimes, and get up at the same time, Monday through Friday.
Structure the day for learning, free time, healthy meals and snacks, and physical activity.
Allow flexibility in the schedule—it’s okay to adapt based on your day.


Consider the needs and adjustment required for your child’s age group.

The transition to being at home will be different for preschoolers, K-5, middle school students, and high school students. Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school.
Consider ways your child can stay connected with their friends without spending time in person.


Look for ways to make learning fun.

Have hands-on activities, like puzzles, painting, drawing, and making things.
Independent play can also be used in place of structured learning. Encourage children to build a fort from sheets or practice counting by stacking blocks.
Practice handwriting and grammar by writing letters to family members. This is a great way to connect and limit face-to-face contact.
Start a journal with your child to document this time and discuss the shared experience.
Use audiobooks or see if your local library is hosting virtual or live-streamed reading events.



"
"While school’s out, will kids have access to meals?",Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal. Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
"While school’s out, how can I keep my family healthy?","

Watch your child for any signs of illness.

If you see any sign of illness consistent with symptoms of COVID-19, particularly fever, cough, or shortness of breath, call your healthcare provider and keep your child at home and away from others as much as possible. Follow CDC’s guidance on “What to do if you are sick.”


Watch for signs of stress in your child.

Some common changes to watch for include excessive worry or sadness, unhealthy eating or sleeping habits, and difficulty with attention and concentration. For more information, see the “For Parents” section on CDC’s website, Manage Anxiety and Stress.
Take time to talk with your child or teen about the COVID-19 outbreak. Answer questions and share facts about COVID-19 in a way that your child or teen can understand.
Go to CDC’s Helping Children Cope with Emergencies or Talking with Children About COVID-19 for more information.


Teach and reinforce everyday preventive actions.

Parents and caretakers play an important role in teaching children to wash their hands. Explain that hand washing can keep them healthy and stop the virus from spreading to others.
Be a good role model—if you wash your hands often, they’re more likely to do the same.
Make handwashing a family activity.


Help your child stay active.

Encourage your child to play outdoors—it’s great for physical and mental health. Take a walk with your child or go on a bike ride.
Use indoor activity breaks (stretch breaks, dance breaks) throughout the day to help your child stay healthy and focused.


Help your child stay socially connected.

Reach out to friends and family via phone or video chats.
Write cards or letters to family members they may not be able to visit.
Some schools and non-profits, such as the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learningexternal iconexternal icon and The Yale Center for Emotional Intelligenceexternal iconexternal icon, have resources for social and emotional learning. Check to see if your school has tips and guidelines to help support social and emotional needs of your child.



"
"While school’s out, limit time with older adults, including relatives, and people with chronic medical conditions.","Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.

If others in your home are at particularly high risk for severe illness from COVID-19, consider extra precautions to separate your child from those people.
If you are unable to stay home with your child during school dismissals, carefully consider who might be best positioned to provide childcare. If someone at higher risk for COVID-19 will be providing care (older adult, such as a grandparent or someone with a serious underlying medical condition), limit your children’s contact with other people.
Consider postponing visits or trip to see older family members and grandparents. Connect virtually or by writing letters and sending via mail.

"
How can my family and I prepare for COVID-19?,"Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:

Talk with the people who need to be included in your plan, and discuss what to do if a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your community.
Plan ways to care for those who might be at greater risk for serious complications, particularly older adults and those with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease.

Make sure they have access to several weeks of medications and supplies in case you need to stay home for prolonged periods of time.


Get to know your neighbors and find out if your neighborhood has a website or social media page to stay connected.
Create a list of local organizations that you and your household can contact in the event you need access to information, healthcare services, support, and resources.
Create an emergency contact list of family, friends, neighbors, carpool drivers, health care providers, teachers, employers, the local public health department, and other community resources.

"
What steps can my family take to reduce our risk of getting COVID-19?,"Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same. These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.
Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throw the tissue in the trash.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.

Launder items, including washable plush toys, as appropriate and in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry from an ill person can be washed with other people’s items.

"
What should I do if someone in my house gets sick with COVID-19?,"Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:

Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.

When to Seek Medical AttentionIf you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately. Emergency warning signs include*:

Trouble breathing
Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
New confusion or inability to arouse
Bluish lips or face

*This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.



Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible).
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
Provide your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent spreading COVID-19 to others.
Clean the sick room and bathroom, as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person.
Avoid sharing personal items like utensils, food, and drinks.

"How can I prepare in case my child’s school, child care facility, or university is dismissed?","Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan. Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals. If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the school’s plan for a COVID-19 outbreak."
How can I prepare for COVID-19 at work?,"Plan for potential changes at your workplace. Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19."
Should I use soap and water or a hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?,"Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol."
What cleaning products should I use to protect against COVID-19?,"Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.  If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. See CDC’s recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection."
Should I make my own hand sanitizer if I can’t find it in the stores?,"


CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available. These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.

When washing hands, you can use plain soap or antibacterial soap. Plain soap is as effective as antibacterial soap at removing germs.
If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an FDA-approved alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. You can tell if the sanitizer contains at least 60% alcohol by looking at the product label.

CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product. Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon. Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.

To be effective against killing some types of germs, hand sanitizers need to have a strength of at least 60% alcohol and be used when hands are not visibly dirty or greasy.
Do not rely on “Do It Yourself” or “DIY” recipes based solely on essential oils or formulated without correct compounding practices.
Do not use hand sanitizer to disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects. See CDC’s information for cleaning and sanitizing your home.

See FAQs about hand hygiene for healthcare personnel responding to COVID-2019.


"
What should I do if there is an outbreak in my community?,"During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work. Follow the steps below:
Protect yourself and others.

Stay home if you are sick. Keep away from people who are sick. Limit close contact with others as much as possible (about 6 feet).

Put your household plan into action.

Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation. Be aware of temporary school dismissals in your area, as this may affect your household’s daily routine.


Continue practicing everyday preventive actions. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains 60% alcohol. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily using a regular household detergent and water.
Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your regular work schedule changes. Ask to work from home or take leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your child’s school is dismissed temporarily. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
Stay in touch with others by phone or email. If you have a chronic medical condition and live alone, ask family, friends, and health care providers to check on you during an outbreak. Stay in touch with family and friends, especially those at increased risk of developing severe illness, such as older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions.

"
Will schools be dismissed if there is an outbreak in my community?,"Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your child’s school. If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friend’s house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall."
Should I go to work if there is an outbreak in my community?,"Follow the advice of your local health officials. Stay home if you can. Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your child’s school is dismissed temporarily. Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak."
Will businesses and schools close or stay closed in my community and for how long? Will there be a “stay at home” or “shelter in place” order in my community?,"CDC makes recommendations, shares information, and provides guidance to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. including guidance for schools and businesses. CDC regularly shares information and provides assistance to state, local, territorial, and tribal health authorities. These local authorities are responsible for making decisions including  “stay at home” or “shelter in place.” What is included in these orders and how they are implemented are also decided by local authorities. These decisions may also depend on many factors such as how the virus is spreading in a certain community.
Please contact your local health department to find out more."
What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?,"Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing. Read about COVID-19 Symptoms."
Should I be tested for COVID-19?,"Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19."
Where can I get tested for COVID-19?,"The process and locations for testing vary from place to place. Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider. State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested. See Testing for COVID-19 for more information."
Can a person test negative and later test positive for COVID-19?,"Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the person’s sample. In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness."
Who is at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:

People aged 65 years and older
People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility

People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:

People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma
People who have serious heart conditions
People who are immunocompromised

Many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications


People with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥40)
People with diabetes
People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis
People with liver disease

"
What should people at higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19 do?,"If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should:

Stock up on supplies
Take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others
When you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick
Limit close contact and wash your hands often
Avoid crowds, cruise travel, and non-essential travel

If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor. More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19."
How were the underlying conditions for people considered higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19 selected?,"This list is based on:

What we are learning from the outbreak in other countries and in the United States.
What we know about risk from other respiratory infections, like flu.

As CDC gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in the United States, we will update this list as needed."
Are there any medications I should avoid taking if I have COVID-19?,"
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible. Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.
"
What about underlying medical conditions that are not included on this list?,"Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19. CDC is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more. People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:

Take steps to protect yourself and others.
Call your healthcare provider if you are sick with a fever, cough, or shortness of breath.
Follow CDC travel guidelines and the recommendations of your state and local health officials.

"
What does a well-controlled health condition mean?,"Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition. You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed."
What does more severe illness mean?,Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your body’s function.  You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
Are people with disabilities at higher risk?,"Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.  Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.

People with certain disabilities might experience higher rates of chronic health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19. Adults with disabilities are three times more likely to have heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer than adults without disabilities.

You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed."
What should healthcare professionals and health departments do?,"For recommendations and guidance on persons under investigation; infection control, including personal protective equipment guidance; home care and isolation; and case investigation, see Information for Healthcare Professionals. For information on specimen collection and shipment, see Information for Laboratories. For information for public health professional on COVID-19, see Information for Public Health Professionals."
Am I at risk if I go to a funeral or visitation service for someone who died of COVID-19?,There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19.
Am I at risk if I touch someone who died of COVID-19 after they have passed away?,"COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time). Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled."
What do funeral home workers need to know about handling decedents who had COVID-19?,"A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19. Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19. If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected. For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.
Embalming can be conducted. During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g. disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator). Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturer’s label. Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin. Additional information on how to safely conduct aerosol-generating procedures is in the CDC’s Postmortem Guidance. Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions. Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time).
After cleaning and removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water is not available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases."
What should I do if my family member died from COVID-19 while overseas?,"When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased person’s next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State. Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies. If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of State’s Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444. For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer. In addition, the US embassyexternal iconexternal iconexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance."
My family member died from COVID-19 while overseas. What are the requirements for returning the body to the United States?,"CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy. Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceased’s employer. There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:

The remains are cremated; OR
The remains are properly embalmed and placed in a hermetically sealed casket; OR
The remains are accompanied by a permit issued by the CDC Director. The CDC permit (if applicable) must accompany the human remains at all times during shipment.

Permits for the importation of the remains of a person known or suspected to have died from a quarantinable communicable disease may be obtained through the CDC Division of Global Migration and Quarantine by calling the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100 or emailing dgmqpolicyoffice@cdc.gov.



Please see CDC’s guidance for additional information."
What is CDC doing about COVID-19?,"CDC is working with other federal partners in a whole-of-government response. This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and CDC will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available. CDC works 24/7 to protect people’s health. More information about CDC’s response to COVID-19 is available online."
Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals?,"At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread COVID-19 to people or that they might be a source of infection in the United States. To date, CDC has not received any reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene. For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDC’s Healthy Pets, Healthy People website."
Do I need to get my pet tested for COVID-19?,"No. At this time, testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended."
Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur?,"At this time, there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread to people from the skin or fur of pets.
Talk to your veterinarian about the best ways to care for your pet."
Should I avoid contact with pets or other animals if I am sick with COVID-19?,"You should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the new coronavirus. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets."
Are pets from a shelter safe to adopt?,"There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, in the United States might be a source of COVID-19."
What about imported animals or animal products?,"CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States. CDC regulates animals and animal products that pose a threat to human health, USDA regulatesexternal iconexternal icon animals and animal products that pose a threat to agriculture; and FWS regulatesexternal iconexternal icon importation of endangered species and wildlife that can harm the health and welfare of humans, the interests of agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, and the welfare and survival of wildlife resources."
Can I travel to the United States with dogs or import dogs into the United States during the COVID-19 outbreak?,"Please refer to CDC’s requirements for bringing a dog to the United States. The current requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from China, a high-risk country for rabies."
"What precautions should be taken for animals that have recently been imported from outside the United States (for example, by shelters, rescues, or as personal pets)?","Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDAexternal iconexternal icon requirements for entering the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available."
신종 코로나바이러스란?,"신종 코로나바이러스란 과거에 규명 사례가 없었던 새로운 코로나바이러스입니다. 코로나바이러스 감염증 2019(COVID-19)를 유발하는 이 바이러스는, 흔한 감기처럼 가벼운 질병을 유발하면서 사람들 사이에 흔히 돌고있는 코로나바이러스와는 다른 것입니다.
코로나바이러스 229E, NL63, OC43, 또는 HKU1 진단은 COVID-19 진단과 다릅니다. COVID-19 환자는 일반 코로나바이러스 진단을 받은 환자와 다른 방법으로 진찰과 치료를 받습니다."
"코로나바이러스 감염증 2019, COVID-19라 부르는 이유는 무엇입니까?","2020년 2월 11, 세계보건기구(WHO)에서는 중국 우한에서 최초 확인된 2019 신종 코로나바이러스 발병을 야기하는 감염증에 대한 공식 명칭을 발표했습니다. 이 감염증의 새 명칭은 코로나바이러스 감염증 2019이며, 줄여서 COVID-19입니다. COVID-19에서 'CO'는 '코로나'를 나타내며 'VI'는 '바이러스', 'D'는 감염증을 나타냅니다. 그 전에는 이 감염증을 ""2019 신종 코로나바이러스"" 또는 ""2019-nCoV""라고 불렀습니다.
사람에게 감염되는 코로나바이러스에는, 일반적으로 보통 정도의 상기도 질환을 일으키는 종류를 포함한 여러 종류가 있습니다. COVID-19는 새로운 감염병으로서, 과거에는 사람에게서 발견된 적이 없는 신종(또는 새로운) 코로나바이러스에 의해 발생합니다. 이 감염병의 명칭은 새로운 인간 감염 질병의 명명법에 대한 세계보건기구(WHO)의 모범 지침외부 링크 아이콘외부 링크 아이콘에 따라 선정되었습니다."
왜 어떤 사람들은 COVID-19를 이유로 사람 또는 집단을 비난하거나 피하는 행동(사회적 낙인 찍기)을 하는 걸까요?,"미국에 사는 사람들은 COVID-19가 확산 중인 지역에 살고 있거나 방문 중인 친지를 걱정하거나 불안해 할 수 있습니다. 어떤 사람들은 이들로부터 감염되었는지를 걱정합니다. 두려움과 불안은 세계의 특정 지역에 거주하는 사람들이나 해외 여행자, 격리 중인 사람들, 또는 의료 전문가들에 대한 사회적 낙인을 야기할 수 있습니다.
낙인은 식별 가능한 민족 집단, 장소 또는 국가에 대한 차별입니다. 낙인은 COVID-19 감염 방식에 관한 지식 부족, 누군가에게 책임을 돌려야 할 필요성, 질병과 죽음에 대한 두려움, 소문과 미신을 퍼뜨리는 가십 등과 연관되어 있습니다.
낙인은 문제를 일으키는 질병 대신, 평범한 사람들을 향해 더 큰 두려움 또는 분노를 유발함으로써 모든 사람들에게 상처를 줍니다."
COVID-19 관련된 사회적 낙인을 어떻게 멈출 수 있을까요?,사람들은 이러한 일이 벌어지는 것을 목격한 상황에서 사회적 지지를 표시함으로써 낙인에 맞설 수 있습니다. 낙인은 낙인이 찍힌 집단의 정서적 또는 정신적 건강과 이들이 살고 있는 지역사회에 영향을 미칩니다 낙인을 멈추는 것은 지역사회와 그 구성원들을 건강하게 만드는 데 중요합니다. COVID-19 시기의 정신 건강과 대처법에 관한 자료를 참고하시기 바랍니다. 정확한 사실을 알고 이를  지역사회의 다른 사람들에게 알림으로써 COVID-19 관련 낙인찍기를 멈추는 데 모두가 기여할 수 있습니다.
때때로 일부 주의 COVID-19 발생수가 CDC 웹사이트에 게시된 발생수와 다른 이유는 무엇입니까?,CDC의 전체 발생수는 관할 구역의 확인 과정을 거쳐야 유효합니다. 장소마다 사례를 찾아 확인해 표시하는 데 사용하는 과정이 서로 다를 수 있습니다.
CDC의 COVID-19 발생수는 WHO(세계보건기구) 또는 존홉킨스에서 제공하는 발생수와 어떻게 다릅니까?,"CDC의 COVID-19 발생수는 주, 지역, 영토, 국제 및 외부 파트너의 정보를 포함하여 공개적으로 보고된 다양한 수를 포함합니다."
전날의 발생수가 증가하는 이유는 무엇입니까?,"보고가 지연되면 전날 보고한 COVID-19 사례수가 증가할 수도 있습니다(이런 효과를 ""backfill(나중 채우기)""이라고 부름). 주, 지역, 영토별 보건부서는 확인된 사례수를 보고하고 이러한 데이터를 CDC와 공유합니다. 연구실 검사 실시에 시간이 걸리므로 전날 사례가 며칠 늦게 매일 계산에 추가되기도 합니다."
이 바이러스의 발생원은 무엇입니까?,"COVID-19는 SARS-CoV-2라고 하는 코로나바이러스로 유발됩니다. 코로나바이러스는 대규모 바이러스군으로 사람과 여러 종의 동물(예: 낙타, 소, 고양이, 박쥐 등)에서 흔히 관찰되는 바이러스입니다. 드물지만, 동물 코로나바이러스가 사람을 감염시킬 수 있으며, 그 후 사람 사이에 전파될 수 있습니다. MERS-CoV와 SARS-CoV가 그러한 경우이며 현재는 COVID-19를 일으키는 신종 바이러스에서 나타나고 있습니다. COVID-19의  발생원과 확산에 관한 더 자세한 정보는 상황 요약: 바이러스 발생원 및 확산에서 보실 수 있습니다."
이 바이러스는 어떻게 확산됩니까?,"COVID-19를 일으키는 바이러스는 주로 사람에서 사람으로 전파되며, 주로 감염된 사람이 기침이나 재채기를 할 때 생성되는 호흡기 비말을 통해 발생하는 것으로 생각됩니다. 이 비말은 근처에 있는 사람들의 입이나 코에 닿거나 폐로 흡입될 수 있습니다. 사람들이 다른 사람과 밀접하게 접촉해 있을 때(약 6피트 이내)전파가 일어날 가능성이 높습니다.
감염이 이루어진 여러 지역의 사례를 볼 때, COVID-19는 지역사회 내에서 쉽게 지속적으로 확산되는 것으로 보입니다(""지역사회 전파""). 지역사회 전파란 어떤 지역에서 사람들이 바이러스에 감염되는데, 감염 경로와 장소가 불명확한 사람들이 있는 경우를 말합니다.
새로 등장한 코로나바이러스의 확산에 관해 알려진 정보를 숙지하세요."
왜 사례가 증가하고 있습니까?,"미국에서 보고되는 COVID-19 사례 수는 전국적인 실험실 진단검사 및 보고의 확대로 인해 증가하고 있습니다. 사례 수의 증가는 미국의 여러 주와 자치 지역에서 지역사회 전파가 이루어지면서 COVID-19가 급속히 확산되고 있음을 반영합니다. 보다 상세하고 정확한 자료가 확보되면 발병 규모와 범위를 더 잘 파악하고 추적할 수 있으며, 예방 및 대응 활동을 강화할 수 있을 것입니다."
COVID-19에 걸린 사람이 다른 사람들에게 그 질병을 퍼뜨릴 수 있습니까?,"COVID-19를 일으키는 바이러스는 사람에서 사람으로 전파됩니다. 증상이 가장 심할 때(가장 아픈 때) 가장 전염성이 높은 것으로 여겨집니다. 그 때문에 CDC에서는 이러한 환자들이 호전되거나 다른 사람에게 감염을 일으킬 위험성이 사라질 때까지(증상 정도에 따라) 병원 내 또는 자택 격리를 권고합니다. 보다 최근에는 증상이 없는 사람에게서도 바이러스가 검출되었습니다.
사람마다 아픈 증세가 있는 기간은 다양할 수 있기 때문에 주 및 지역 공중 보건 담당자가 협의하여 검사 기반 또는 비검사 기반 전략(즉 질병이 시작된 이후 시간 및 회복 이후 시간)을 사용해 누구를 언제 격리 해제할 것인지 정해야 합니다. 이러한 결정에는 질병 심각성, 질병 징후, 증상 및 환자에 대한 실험실 검사 결과를 포함한 각 상황의 구체적인 사항이 고려되어야 합니다.
COVID-19 환자 격리 해제 시점 및 입원 환자 퇴원에 관한 CDC 지침을 자세히 알아보세요. COVID-19 확진자가 언제 자가 격리를 중단할 수 있는지에 대한 정보는 COVID-19 환자의 자가 격리 중단을 위한 임시 지침을 참조해 주세요.
격리에서 해제된 사람은 다른 사람을 감염시킬 위험이 있다고 간주되지 않습니다."
COVID-[#0]로 격리되었던 사람이 다른 사람을 전염시킬 수 있습니까?,"격리는 전염병에 노출되었으나 질병에 걸리지 않은 사람(증상이 없는 사람)이나 집단을 노출되지 않은 다른 사람으로부터 분리하여 질병의 확산 가능성을 예방하는 것을 의미합니다. 격리는 일반적으로 전염성 질병의 잠복기간에 실시되며, 이는 사람들이 바이러스에 노출된 후 질병에 걸리는 기간입니다. COVID-19의 경우, 격리 기간은 바이러스 노출 마지막 날로부터 14일이며, 이는 이 바이러스의 잠복기가 2~14일이기 때문입니다. COVID-19로 격리 해제된 사람은 잠복기 기간 동안 질병이 발생하지 않았으므로 다른 사람에게 바이러스를 퍼뜨릴 위험이 없다고 봅니다."
"COVID-19를 일으키는 바이러스는 식당 배달 음식, 냉장 또는 냉동 식품을 포함한 식품류를 통해 퍼질 수 있습니까?","코로나바이러스는 일반적으로 호흡기 비말을 통해 사람에서 사람으로 퍼지는 것으로 알려져 있습니다. 현재 식품과 관련된 COVID-19의 전달을 뒷받침할 근거는 없습니다. 일반적인 식품 안전을 위해서는 항상 음식을 준비하거나 먹기 전에 비누와 물로 20초 동안 손을 씻는 것이 중요합니다. 기침이나 재채기를 할 때 항상 휴지로 가리고, 코를 풀거나 기침을 하거나 재채기를 하거나 용변을 본 후에는 항상 손을 씻도록 합니다.
바이러스가 있는 포장 용기와 같은 표면이나 물체를 만진 후 자신의 입, 코 또는 눈을 만지면 COVID-19에 걸릴 수 있지만, 이것은 바이러스가 확산되는 주된 방법이 아닙니다.
일반적으로 물체의 표면에서 이러한 코로나바이러스의 생존력이 높지 않기 때문에 식품이나 포장을 통해 확산될 위험은 매우 낮다고 생각됩니다.
COVID-19의 전파에 관해 알려진 정보를 숙지하세요."
바이러스가 음식에 있는 경우 COVID-19에 걸릴 수 있나요?,"현재까지 이 신종 코로나바이러스에 대해 알려진 정보를 바탕으로, COVID-19가 음식을 통해 전파되는 것으로 생각되지 않습니다. 더 많은 연구가 필요합니다."
따뜻한 날씨가 COVID-19의 발병을 막을 수 있습니까?,"날씨와 온도가 COVID-19의 확산에 영향을 미치는지는 아직 알려지지 않았습니다. 일반적인 감기와 독감과 같은 다른 바이러스는 추운 날씨에 더 많이 퍼지지만, 그렇다고 해서 다른 계절에 이 바이러스에 감염되지 않는다는 것을 의미하지는 않습니다. COVID-19와 관련된 전파성, 심각성 및 기타 특징에 대해 더 많은 정보가 필요하며 조사가 진행 중입니다."
지역사회 감염이란 무엇입니까?,"지역사회 감염은 한 지역에서 사람들이 바이러스에 감염된 것을 말하는데, 감염경로가 불분명한 상태로 감염된 환자까지 포함하는 것입니다."
COVID-19를 유발하는 바이러스는 어떤 온도에서 죽습니까?,"일반적으로 코로나바이러스는 저온의 건조한 환경보다 고온의 다습한 환경에서 생존 기간이 더 짧습니다. 그러나 아직까지는 이 바이러스에 대한 직접적인 데이터가 없으며 활동이 중지되는 온도가 몇 도인지에 대한 직접적인 데이터도 없습니다. 생존 또는 활동 중지에 필요한 온도는 표면 재질, 환경 등에도 영향을 받습니다. 온도에 상관없이 CDC의 세척 및 소독 지침을 따르시기 바랍니다."
모기나 진드기가 COVID-19를 일으키는 바이러스를 퍼뜨릴 수 있을까요?,"현재 CDC가 파악하고 있는 바로는, 이 신종 코로나바이러스나 다른 유사한 코로나바이러스가 모기나 진드기에 의해 전파됨을 시사하는 자료는 없습니다. COVID-19가 퍼지는 주요 경로는 사람간 전염입니다. 자세한 내용은 코로나바이러스의 전파 경로를 참조해 주세요."

CDC에서는 COVID-19를 예방하기 위해 마스크나 얼굴 가리개 사용을 권장합니까?,"COVID-19 전파 경로에 관한 새로운 자료와, COVID-19 질환이 전국적으로 만연했음을 보여는 증거에 입각하여, CDC는 지역사회에서 코와 입을 덮는 천으로 만든 마스크를 착용할 것을 권장합니다. 이는 COVID-19 확산 방지를 위해 실천하는 사회적 거리두기, 손 자주 씻기 등 기타 일상적 예방 수칙에 더하여(대신이 아니라) 실천해야 할 추가적인 공중보건 수칙입니다. 천으로 된 마스크의 목적은 착용자 보호가 아니라 착용자로부터 다른 사람에게 바이러스가 전파되는 것을 막는 데 있습니다. 이는 무증상 감염자의 경우에 특히 더 중요한 사항입니다. 대중들이 모이는 장소(가령 식료품점)을 가야 할 때마다 천으로 된 얼굴 가리개를 착용해야 합니다. 의료용 마스크와 N-95 호흡기는 현재 CDC 지침에서 권장하는 대로 의료 종사자와 기타 긴급구조대원이 쓸 수 있도록 양보해야 합니다."
중국에서 배달되어 온 택배 물건이나 상품으로 인해 COVID-19에 노출될 위험이 있습니까?,"COVID-19와 그 전파 경로에 대해서는 아직 알려지지 않은 것이 많습니다. 이 코로나바이러스는 호흡기 분비물을 통해 가장 잘 퍼지는 것으로 생각됩니다. 일부 물체 표면에서 바이러스가 짧은 기간 동안 생존할 수 있으나, 실온에서 며칠 또는 몇 주 걸려 배송되는 제품이나 소포로부터 전파될 가능성은 거의 없습니다. 현재 수입 물품과 관련된 COVID-19의 전파를 입증하는 증거는 없으며 미국 내에서 수입품과 관련된 COVID-19 발병 사례는 없었습니다. 새로운 관련 정보는 입수되는 대로 코로나바이러스 감염증 2019(COVID-19) 웹사이트에 게시될 것입니다."
헌혈을 해도 됩니까?,"미국 전역의 의료 환경에서 기증된 혈액은 환자의 생명을 구하는데 필수적인 것입니다. 기증된 혈액은 지속적으로 필요하기 때문에 혈액센터가 운영되고 있으며 혈액기부가 절실합니다. CDC는 COVID-19 때문에 사회적 거리두기를 실천하고 있지만, 건강한 사람은 가능한 경우에 혈액을 계속 기증하기를 권장합니다. CDC는 혈액기증자와 직원의 안전을 지키도록 하는 권고안을 마련해 혈액센터를 지원하고 있습니다. 이러한 권고의 예로는 기증자 의자를 6피트 간격으로 두기, 환경 청소 지침을 철저히 준수하기, 기증자가 미리 예약을 한 후 방문하기 등이 있습니다."

아이들이 COVID-19로 아프게 될 위험은 어느 정도입니까?,"현재까지 파악된 증거에 따르면, 어린이는 성인보다 COVID-19의 위험이 더 높은 것으로 보이지 않습니다. 일부 어린이와 유아에서 COVID-19 발병 사례가 있으나, 현재까지 알려진 대부분의 사례는 성인이었습니다. COVID-19로 인한 중증 질환 고위험군에 관한 자세한 내용은 중증 질환 고위험군 페이지에서 확인하실 수 있습니다."
COVID-19 감염으로부터 우리 아이들을 어떻게 보호할 수 있습니까?,"건강 유지를 위해 모든 사람이 지켜야 하는 수칙들을 동일하게 지키도록 아이들을 가르침으로써 COVID-19의 확산을 막도록 격려할 수 있습니다.

아픈 사람과 가까운 접촉을 피하십시오.
아플 때는 진료를 받으러 가는 것 외에는 집에 머물러 있어야 합니다.
기침과 재채기를 할 때에는 휴지로 가리고 하고 휴지는 쓰레기통에 버립니다.
최소한 20초 이상 비누와 물로 손을 자주 씻으세요. 특히 코를 풀거나 기침, 재채기를 한 후, 화장실을 사용한 후, 음식을 먹거나 준비하기 전에 꼭 손을 씻어야 합니다.
비누와 물을 쉽게 이용할 수 있는 상황이 아닌 경우 60% 이상의 알코올이 포함된 알코올 성분 손소독제를 사용하세요. 손이 눈에 보일 정도로 더러우면 항상 비누와 물로 손을 씻으십시오.
자주 접촉하는 표면과 물체(예: 테이블, 조리대, 조명 스위치, 문 손잡이 및 캐비닛 손잡이)를 닦고 소독합니다.
세탁이 가능한 털인형 장난감을 포함한 세탁물 품목을 제조업체의 지시에 따라 적절하게 세탁합니다. 가능한 경우, 품목에 따라 적절한 물 온도 중 가장 따뜻한 온도로 설정하여 세탁을 하고 완전히 건조시킵니다. 아픈 사람의 세탁물은 다른 사람의 물건과 함께 세탁할 수 있습니다.

COVID-19 증상은 어린이와 성인의 차이가 있습니까?,"아닙니다. COVID-19의 증상은 어린이와 성인이 비슷합니다. 그러나 COVID-19 확진을 받은 어린이는 일반적으로 가벼운 증상을 나타냈습니다. 소아에서 보고된 증상에는 열, 콧물, 기침 등 감기 같은 증상이 포함됩니다. 구토와 설사도 보고되었습니다. 일부 아동이 심각한 질병에 걸릴 위험이 더 높은지 여부는 아직 알려져 있지 않습니다(예: 기저 질환이 있거나 특별 관리가 필요한 아동). 이 질병이 어린이에게 미치는 영향에 대해서는 밝혀내야 할 부분이 상당히 많습니다."
어린이들이 마스크를 써야 합니까?,"CDC는 2세 이상인 모든 사람이 지역사회에 외출할 때 코와 입을 가리는 천 가리개를 착용할 것을 권장합니다. 2세 미만 아기나 어린이는 질식 위험이 있으므로 천 가리개를 덮지 말아야 합니다. 2세 미만 어린이뿐만 아니라 호흡에 문제가 있거나 의식이 없거나, 무력하거나, 도움 없이 얼굴 덮개를 벗을 수 없는 사람은 예외로 합니다.
천 가리개 착용은 사회적 거리두기, 손 자주 씻기, 기타 일상적인 예방 조치에 더해 COVID-19 확산을 줄이기 위해 취해야 하는 공중보건 조치입니다. 천 가리개는 착용자를 보호하기 위한 것이 아니라 바이러스가 착용자로부터 다른 사람에게 퍼지는 것을 막기 위한 것입니다. 감염되었으나 증상이 없는 경우에 천 가리개 착용은 특히 더 중요합니다. 의료용 안면 마스크 및 N95 호흡보호구는 현재 CDC 지침에서 권장하는 대로 의료진 및 긴급구조대원에게 양보해야 합니다."
우리 지역에서 COVID-19가 발병할 때 어떻게 아이들을 준비시켜야 합니까?,"전염병의 발병은 성인과 어린이 모두에게 스트레스가 될 수 있습니다. 전염병 발병에 대해 자녀와 대화를 나누되, 침착한 태도를 유지하면서, 안전하다고 안심시키기 바랍니다. 적절한 경우, COVID-19로 인한 대부분의 병증이 경미한 것 같다고 설명하십시오. 스트레스 상황에 대한 어린이의 반응은 성인과 다릅니다. CDC에서는 COVID-19에 관해 자녀와 대화할 때 도움이 되는 자료를 제공하고 있습니다."
지역사회에 감염이 있을 때 부모들은 아이들을 보호하기 위해 어떤 조치를 취해야 합니까?,"이 바이러스는 신종 바이러스로 아직 연구가 진행 중이지만, 현재까지는 아동에게 질병이 많이 발생하는 것 같지 않습니다. 심각한 질병을 포함한 많은 사례들이 노동 연령의 성인 및 고령자에서 발생하고 있습니다. 그러나, 어린이도 바이러스에 감염되어 증상이 나타날 수 있습니다. 국가 전체의 많은 학교에서 임시 휴교를 발표했습니다. 지역사회 내 휴교 상황을 추적하십시오. 휴교를 알리는 지역 매체를 읽거나 시청하십시오. 학교가 일시적으로 휴교하는 경우, 필요에 따라 대체 보육 계획을 준비하십시오.
자녀가 COVID-19로 아프게 되면 보육 시설 또는 학교에 알리십시오. 학교 진도를 따라갈 수 있도록 집에서 할 수 있는 수업 과제 및 활동에 대해 교사와 상의하십시오.

"휴교 기간 동안, 아이가 친구들과 어울려 놀아도 됩니까?","

COVID-19 확산 속도를 늦추는 열쇠는 사회적 거리두기입니다. 휴교 기간 동안 어린이들은 다른 집 어린이와 직접 만나 놀 수 없습니다. 아이들이 집 밖에서 놀고 있다면, 외부에 있는 모든 사람과 6피트 거리를 유지해야 합니다.
사회적 거리두기를 지키면서 친구 관계를 유지할 수 있도록 어른의 감독하에 자녀가 친구들과 전화 통화 또는 화상 채팅을 하게 도와주세요.
아이들이 비누와 물로 자주 손을 씻는 등 일상적 예방 수칙을 반드시 실천하게 하십시오. 아이들이 학교 밖에서 무리지어 만나면 모두가 위험에 처할 수 있음을 기억해야 합니다. 
봄 방학 및 기타 여행 계획에서 불필요한 여행은 변경하십시오.


어린이와 COVID-19에 관한 정보는 다소 제한적이지만, 현재까지 파악된 자료에 따르면 COVID-19 에 감염된 어린이는 가벼운 증상만 보일 가능성이 높습니다. 그러나 이 어린이들이 다른 노인과 중증 기저질환자를 포함한 고위험군에게 이 바이러스를 옮길 가능성은 여전히 존재합니다.

바이러스가 있는 표면이나 물체를 만진 후 입, 코 또는 눈을 만져서 COVID-19에 감염될 수 있지만 이는 바이러스가 퍼지는 주요 방법이라고 여겨지지는 않습니다.
COVID-19로 사망한 사람의 시신은 만지지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 노인과 심각한 기저 질환을 앓고 있는 모든 연령대의 사람은 중증의 COVID-19 질병에 걸릴 위험이 더 높습니다. 시신을 공개할 준비가 완료된 후에는 손을 잡거나 포옹하는 등의 특정 접촉 유형으로 인해 바이러스가 확산될 가능성은 적을 수 있습니다. 시신 준비 이전, 도중, 이후에는 키스, 세척, 수의 입히기 등의 기타 행동은 가능하면 피하는 것이 좋습니다. 시신의 세척 또는 수의가 중요한 종교적 또는 문화적 관습인 경우, 가족은 지역사회의 문화적, 종교적 지도자 및 장례식장 직원과 협력하며 시신의 노출을 가능한 줄여야 합니다. 최소한 이러한 활동을 하는 사람들은 일회용 장갑을 착용해야 합니다. 액체가 튀는 것이 예상되면 추가 개인 보호 장비(PPE)(예: 일회용 가운, 안면 가리개 또는 고글과 N-95 호흡기)가 필요할 수 있습니다.
청소는 청소 및 소독 용품에 대한 제조사의 지침(예: 농도, 사용 방법, 접촉 시간)에 따라 수행되어야 합니다. 새로운 바이러스성 병원체에 대한 환경 보호국(EPA) 승인 표시가 된 제품pdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon은 죽이기 어려운 바이러스에 대한 자료를 근거로 볼 때 COVID-19에 효과가 있을 것으로 예상됩니다. PPE를 벗은 후에는 비누와 물로 20초 이상 손을 씻거나, 비누와 물을 사용할 수 없는 경우에는 60% 알코올(또는 그 이상)이 함유된 알코올 성분 위생 소독제를 사용하여 손 위생을 실천해야 합니다. 손이 눈에 띄게 더러운 경우에는 반드시 비누와 물로 씻어야 합니다."
COVID-19에 감염됐던 사망자 처리에 대하여 장례식장 직원이 알아야 할 사항은 무엇입니까?,"COVID-19로 사망한 분들을 위한 장례식 또는 추모식은 가능합니다. 장례식장 직원은 COVID-19로 인한 사망자를 처리할 때 일반적인 감염 예방 및 통제 예방 조치를 따라야 합니다. 시신을 반드시 자루에 넣어야 한다면, 체액이 튈 것이 예상될 경우 추가 개인보호장비(PPE) 착용이 포함된 표준 예방 조치를 따르세요. 시신을 자루에 넣은 후 운반하려면, 죽이기 어려운 바이러스에 대한 데이터에 근거할 때 COVID-19에 효과가 있을 것으로 예상되는, 새로운 바이러스성 병원체에 대한 환경보호국(EPA) 승인 표시가 된 제품pdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon을 사용하여 자루의 바깥 쪽을 소독하세요. 모든 세척 및 소독용품 제조사의 지침에 따라야 합니다(예: 농도, 사용 방법 및 접촉 시간 등). 시신이 든 자루를 취급할 때는 일회용 니트릴 장갑을 착용하세요.
방부 처리도 실시할 수 있습니다. 방부 처리 중에는, 채액이 튈 것이 예상될 경우 추가 PPE(예: 일회용 가운, 얼굴 보호대 또는 고글과 N95 호흡기)의 착용이 포함된 표준 예방 조치를 따르세요. 처리 과정에서 에어로졸이 발생할 것으로 예상되거나, 제품 라벨에 표시된 제조사의 지침에 따라 사용되는 화학물질에 필요할 경우에는 적절한 호흡기 보호 장치를 착용하세요. 베임, 찔림 또는 기타 피부 손상을 야기하는 부상의 위험이 있는 경우에는 일회용 니트릴 장갑 위에 튼튼한 작업용 장갑을 착용하세요. 에어로졸이 발생하는 작업 절차를 안전하게 수행하는 방법에 관해서는 CDC 사후 조치 지침에 추가 정보가 제공되어 있습니다. 세척은 제조업체의 지침에 따라 수행해야 합니다. 새로운 바이러스성 병원체에 대한 환경 보호국(EPA) 승인 표시가 된 제품pdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon은 죽이기 어려운 바이러스에 대한 자료를 근거로 볼 때 COVID-19에 효과가 있을 것으로 예상됩니다. 모든 세척 및 소독용품 제조사의 지침에 따라야 합니다(예: 농도, 사용 방법 및 접촉 시간 등).
PPE를 세척하고 벗은 후에는 비누와 물로 20초 이상 손을 씻거나, 비누와 물을 사용할 수 없는 경우에는 60% 알코올(또는 그 이상)이 함유된 알코올 성분 위생 소독제를 사용하여 손 위생을 실시해야 합니다. 손이 눈에 띄게 더러운 경우에는 반드시 비누와 물로 씻어야 합니다.
COVID-19 사망자는 매장되거나 화장될 수 있습니다. 그러나 특정 전염병으로 사망한 개인의 유골 처리 및 처분에 관한 지시가 있는 주 및 지역에서는 추가 요구 사항들이 있는지 확인하십시오."
해외에서 가족이 COVID-19로 사망한 경우 어떻게 해야 합니까?,"미국 시민권자가 미국 이외의 지역에서 사망한 경우, 사망한 사람의 가장 가까운 친척 또는 법정 대리인은 국무부 미국 영사관 직원에게 그 사실을 알려야 합니다. 영사관 직원들은 해외 긴급 상황에 미국 시민을 지원하기 위해 주 7일, 하루 24시간 동안 일합니다. 가족, 동거인 또는 법정 대리인이 사망자와 다른 국가에 있는 경우, 워싱턴 DC에 있는 국무부의 해외 시민 서비스국(Office of Overseas Citizens Services)에 연락해야 합니다. 월요일부터 금요일, 동부 시간으로 오전 8시부터 오후 5시까지 888-407-4747번(무료) 또는 202-501-4444번으로 연락이 가능합니다. 근무 시간 후 또는 주말 및 공휴일에 응급 지원을 받으려면 국무부 교환대 202-647-4000번으로 전화하여 해외 시민 서비스(Overseas Citizens Services) 당직 직원과의 상담을 요청하세요. 또한, 미국 시민권자가 사망한 국가 또는 해당 국가와 가장 가까운 곳의 미국 대사관external iconexternal iconexternal icon에서 도움을 받으실 수도 있습니다."
해외에서 가족이 COVID-19로 사망했습니다. 시체를 미국으로 이송하기 위한 요건은 무엇입니까?,"CDC는 해외에서 사망한 사람의 유해가 미국으로 이송되기 전에 부검을 요구하지 않습니다. 사망과 관련된 환경에 따라 일부 국가에서는 부검이 필요할 수 있습니다. 가족은 지역 영사관이나 대사관, 여행 보험사, 여행사, 종교 단체, 원조 단체, 사망자의 고용주 등으로부터 지원을 받을 수 있습니다. 시신의 공식 확인 및 영사관에서 발행한 공식 문서가 필요할 가능성이 높습니다.
유해 송환에 관한 CDC의 요건은 시신이 방부 처리되었는지, 화장되었는지 또는 사망 원인이 검역 대상이 될 수 있는 전염병인지에 따라 다릅니다.
현재 COVID-19는 미국에서 검역 가능한 전염병입니다. 시신은 42 연방규정집(42 Code of Federal Regulations) 파트 71.55에 나와 있는 국내 인도 기준을 충족해야 하며, 다음과 같은 조건 아래에서만 미국으로 인도될 수 있도록 허가, 해제 및 승인될 수 있습니다.

추가 정보는 CDC 지침을 참고하십시오."
COVID-19와 관련하여 CDC에서는 어떤 일을 하고 있습니까?,CDC는 정부 전체 대응을 위해 연방 기관들과 협력하고 있습니다. 새로운 상황이 떠올라 급속히 진행되고 있으며 CDC에서는 새로운 정보가 들어오는 대로 계속해서 업데이트할 것입니다. CDC는 국민 건강 보호를 위해 1년 365일 상시 노력하고 있습니다. CDC의 COVID-19 대응에 대한 더 자세한 내용은 온라인에서 확인하실 수 있습니다.
애완동물이나 다른 동물을 통해 COVID-19이 전파될 수 있습니까?,"현재 미국 내에 반려동물 등 동물이 COVID-19를 사람에게 전파하거나 감염원이 될 수 있다는 증거는 없습니다. 현재까지 CDC는 미국에서 반려동물이 COVID-19에 감염되었다는 보고는 받지 않았습니다.
애완동물은 개와 고양이 코로나 바이러스와 같은 다른 종류의 코로나 바이러스를 가지고 있으며, 이는 그들을 감염시킬 수 있습니다. 이러한 다른 종류의 코로나 바이러스는 사람을 감염시킬 수 없으며 현재의 COVID-19 전파와는 관련이 없습니다.
그러나, 동물들이 다른 질병을 사람에게 전파할 수 있기 때문에 반려동물과 다른 동물이 주변에 있는 경우에는 손을 씻고 위생상태를 잘 유지하는 등 건강 습관을 실천하는 것이 좋습니다. 반려동물을 키우는 것에 대한 많은 장점이나, 반려동물, 가축 및 야생 동물을 포함하여 동물의 안전과 건강을 지키는 방법 등 더 많은 정보를 원하시면 CDC의 건강한 반려동물, 건강한 사람들 웹사이트를 참조해 주십시오."
애완동물도 COVID-19 검사를 받아야 합니까?,아니요. 현재 동물에 대한 COVID-19 검사는 권장되지 않습니다.
COVID-19를 유발하는 바이러스가 동물의 피부나 털로 전달될 수 있습니까?,"현재로는 COVID-19를 유발하는 바이러스가 애완동물의 피부나 털에서 사람으로 전파될 수 있다는 증거는 없습니다.
애완동물을 관리하는 방법에 대해서는 수의사와 상담하십시오."
COVID-19에 걸리면 애완 동물이나 다른 동물과의 접촉을 피해야 합니까?,"COVID-19 감염자는 사람에게 하는 것과 마찬가지로 반려동물, 기타 동물과의 접촉을 제한해야 합니다. 미국에서 COVID-19에 걸린 반려동물에 대한 보고는 없지만, COVID-19 감염자는 신종 코로나바이러스에 대해 더 많은 정보가 알려질 때까지 동물과의 접촉을 제한하는 것이 좋습니다. 아플 때는 가능하면 다른 가족이 동물을 돌보게 하십시오. COVID-19에 감염되었으면 반려동물 쓰다듬기, 껴안기, 뽀뽀, 핥기, 음식 공유 등 동물과의 접촉을 피하십시오. 아픈 상태에서 반려동물을 돌보거나 동물 가까이에 있어야 하는 경우 반려동물 접촉 전후에 손을 씻으십시오."
동물보호소로부터 입양하는 애완동물은 안전합니까?,미국에서 동물보호소의 애완동물을 비롯한 어떤 동물도 COVID-19의 감염원이 될 수 있다고 생각할 이유는 없습니다.
수입 동물이나 동물 제품은 어떻게 해야 합니까?,"CDC는 수입 동물 또는 동물 제품이 미국에서 COVID-19를 유포할 위험이 있음을 시사하는 증거가 없습니다. 이는 빠르게 전개되는 상황이며 정보가 들어오는 대로 업데이트할 예정입니다. 미국 질병통제예방센터(CDC), 미국 농무부(USDA), 미국 어류야생생물서비스(FWS)는 살아있는 동물과 동물 제품 미국 수입을 규제하는 명확한 상호 보완 역할을 담당합니다.

COVID-19 발생 시 반려견과 함께 미국으로 여행하거나 미국으로 반려견 수입을 할 수 있습니까?,"개를 미국에 데려오기 위한 CDC 요건을 참조하십시오. 현재, 광견병 위험이 높은 국가인 중국에서 수입한 개에 광견병 예방접종 요건을 적용합니다."
"최근 미국 이외의 지역에서 들여온 동물(예 : 보호소, 구조대, 개인 애완동물)에 대해서는 어떤 예방 조치를 취해야 합니까?","수입 동물은 미국 입국을 위한 CDC 및 USDAexternal iconexternal icon 요구 사항을 충족해야 합니다. 현재는 애완동물과 서비스 동물을 포함한 반려동물이 COVID-19를 퍼뜨릴 수 있다는 증거가 나타난 바 없습니다. 새로운 환경에 처해진 동물과 마찬가지로, 최근 수입 동물에게 질병 징후가 있는지 매일 관찰해야 합니다. 동물이 아프면 반드시 수의사의 검진을 받아야 합니다. 동물을 병원으로 데려오기 전에 클리닉에 전화를 걸어 최근에 다른 나라에서 수입한 사실을 알리십시오.
현재 상황이 빠르게 변화하고 있습니다. 정보가 들어오는 대로 업데이트될 예정입니다."
¿Qué es un nuevo coronavirus? ,"Un nuevo coronavirus es un coronavirus que no había sido identificado previamente. El virus que causa la enfermedad del coronavirus 2019, COVID-19, no es igual a los  coronavirus que circulan comúnmente entre los seres humanos  y que causan enfermedades leves, como el resfriado común.
Un diagnóstico de coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43 o HKU1 no es lo mismo que un diagnóstico de COVID-19. Los pacientes con COVID-19 serán evaluados y atendidos de manera diferente a los pacientes con un diagnóstico de coronavirus común."
¿Por qué a la enfermedad la llaman enfermedad del coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)?,"El 11 de febrero del 2020, la Organización Mundial de la Salud anunció  el nombre oficial de la enfermedad que está causando el brote del nuevo coronavirus 2019 y que se identificó por primera vez en Wuhan, China. El nuevo nombre de la enfermedad es enfermedad del coronavirus 2019, y su forma abreviada es COVID-19. En el COVID-19, ""CO"" corresponde a ""corona"", ""VI"" a ""virus"" y ""D"" a ""disease"" (enfermedad).  Antes, la forma de referirse a esta enfermedad era ""nuevo coronavirus 2019"" o ""2019-nCoV"".
Existen muchos tipos de coronavirus humanos, incluidos algunos que comúnmente causan enfermedades leves en las vías respiratorias superiores. El COVID-19 es una nueva enfermedad, causada por un nuevo coronavirus que no se había visto anteriormente en seres humanos. El nombre de esta enfermedad se eligió siguiendo las  mejores prácticasícono de sitio externoícono de sitio externo establecidas por la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) para denominar nuevas enfermedades infecciosas en seres humanos."
¿Por qué alguien culparía o evitaría a personas y grupos (estigmatizar) debido al COVID-19?,"Es posible que las personas en los EE. UU. estén preocupadas o ansiosas por familiares y amigos que viven en lugares donde se esté propagando el COVID-19 o que estén visitando esas áreas. Algunas personas están preocupadas ante la posibilidad de contagiarse y contraer esta enfermedad. El temor y la ansiedad pueden conducir al estigma social, por ejemplo, hacia personas que viven en determinadas partes del mundo, personas que han viajado al exterior, personas que estuvieron en cuarentena o profesionales de atención médica.
El estigma consiste en discriminar a un grupo específico de personas, un lugar o una nación. El estigma está asociado a la falta de conocimiento acerca de cómo se propaga el COVID-19, la necesidad de culpar a alguien, el temor a las enfermedades y a la muerte, y a los chismes que fomentan rumores y mitos.
El estigma nos perjudica a todos ya que genera más temor y resentimiento hacia las personas comunes en vez de poner el foco de atención en la enfermedad que está causando el problema."
¿Cómo pueden las personas ayudar a detener el estigma relacionado con el COVID-19?,Las personas pueden combatir el estigma si cada vez que que presencian una situación de estigmatización intervienen brindando apoyo social. El estigma afecta la salud mental o emocional de los grupos estigmatizados y de las comunidades en las que viven. Detener el estigma es importante para hacer que las comunidades y los miembros de la comunidad sean resilientes. Vea los recursos sobre salud mental y cómo sobrellevar la situación durante el brote de COVID-19. Todas las personas pueden ayudar a evitar el estigma relacionado con el COVID-19 si conocen los datos y los difunden entre otras personas de sus comunidades.
¿Por qué las cantidades de casos de COVID-19 en algunos estados a veces difieren de lo publicado en el sitio web de los CDC?,El conteo general de casos de los CDC se valida a través de un proceso de confirmación con las jurisdicciones. El proceso de detección y confirmación de los casos publicados por diferentes lugares puede diferir.
¿Cómo se comparan lo conteos de casos de  COVID-19 de los CDC con respecto a los informados por la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) o Johns Hopkins?,"El conteo de casos de COVID-19 de los CDC incluye muchas cifras informadas públicamente, incluida información de socios estatales, locales, territoriales, internacionales y externos."
¿Por qué la cantidad de casos de días anteriores aumenta?,"Las demoras en los informes pueden ocasionar que se incremente la cantidad de casos de COVID-19 informada en días anteriores. (A veces este efecto se conoce como ""backfill"" o relleno en español). Los departamentos de salud estatales, locales y territoriales informan la cantidad de casos confirmados y comparten estos datos con los CDC. Como las pruebas de laboratorio demoran algún tiempo, es posible que se agreguen datos de días anteriores a los conteos diarios con algunos días de demora."
¿Cuál es la fuente del virus?,"El COVID-19 es causado por un coronavirus llamado SARS-CoV-2. Los coronavirus son una familia grande de virus frecuentes en las personas y pueden estar presentes en diferentes especies de animales, como camellos, ganado, gatos y murciélagos.  Es muy poco frecuente que los coronavirus en animales infecten a las personas y luego se propaguen de persona a persona. Esto es lo que ocurrió con el MERS-CoV y SARS-CoV, y ahora con el virus que causa el COVID-19. Hay más información sobre la fuente y la propagación del COVID-19 disponible en el Resumen de la situación: fuente y propagación del virus."
¿Cómo se propaga el virus?,"Se cree que el virus que causa el COVID-19 se propaga principalmente de persona a persona, a través de las gotitas respiratorias producidas cuando una persona infectada tose o estornuda. Estas gotitas pueden terminar en la boca o en la nariz de quienes se encuentran cerca o posiblemente ser inhaladas y llegar a los pulmones. La propagación se vuelve más probable cuando las personas están en contacto cercano entre sí (a una distancia de hasta aproximadamente 6 pies).
El COVID-19 parece estar propagándose fácilmente y de manera continua en la comunidad (""propagación comunitaria"") en muchas áreas geográficas afectadas. La propagación en la comunidad significa que las personas han sido infectadas por el virus en un área, incluidas algunas personas que no saben con certeza cómo ni dónde se infectaron.
Conozca lo que se sabe sobre la  propagación de coronavirus que han aparecido recientemente."
¿Por qué se observa un aumento en los casos?,"La cantidad de casos de COVID-19 que se están notificando en los Estados Unidos va en aumento porque se incrementaron las pruebas de detección de laboratorio  y su notificación en todo el país. El número creciente de casos refleja en parte la rápida propagación del COVID-19, ya que muchos estados y territorios estadounidenses alcanzaron la etapa de propagación en la comunidad. Contar con datos más detallados y precisos nos permitirá comprender y hacer un mejor seguimiento del tamaño y alcance del brote y fortalecer nuestros esfuerzos de prevención y respuesta."
¿Puede alguien que ha tenido el COVID-19 propagarlo a los demás?,"El virus que causa el COVID-19 se está propagando de persona a persona. Se cree que las personas son más contagiosas cuando tienen síntomas (cuando están más enfermas). Es por eso que los CDC recomiendan que estos pacientes sean aislados en un hospital o en su hogar (dependiendo de la gravedad) hasta que estén mejor y ya no representen un riesgo de infección para los demás. En el último tiempo también se ha detectado el virus en personas asintomáticas.
El tiempo durante el que una persona está activamente enferma puede variar, así que la decisión de cuándo permitirle a una persona salir del aislamiento se toma a través de una estrategia basada en pruebas o de una estrategia no basada en pruebas (es decir, el tiempo transcurrido desde que comenzó la enfermedad y el tiempo transcurrido desde la recuperación) tras consultar con los funcionarios de salud pública estatales y locales. La decisión implica analizar los datos específicos de cada situación, incluida la gravedad de la enfermedad, sus signos y síntomas y los resultados de las pruebas de laboratorio de ese paciente.
Obtenga más información acerca de la guía de los CDC sobre cuándo permitirle a una persona salir del aislamiento y cuándo dar de alta a pacientes hospitalizados con COVID-19. Si necesita más información acerca de cuándo puede salir del aislamiento en su casa una persona que se enfermó de COVID-19, consulte la Guía interina para la suspensión del aislamiento en la casa de pacientes con COVID-19.
Se considera que la persona a la que se le permite salir del aislamiento no representa un riesgo de infección para los demás."
¿Puede alguien que ha estado en cuarentena por el COVID-19 propagar la enfermedad a los demás?,"Cuarentena significa separar a una persona o grupo de personas que han estado expuestas a una enfermedad contagiosa, pero que no han presentado la enfermedad (síntomas), de otras personas que no han estado expuestas, con el objetivo de prevenir la posible propagación de esa enfermedad. La cuarentena generalmente se establece para el periodo de incubación de la enfermedad transmisible, el cual es el periodo en el que las personas han manifestado la enfermedad después de la exposición. En el caso del COVID-19, el período de cuarentena es de 14 días a partir de la fecha de exposición, ya que el período de incubación del virus es de entre 2 y 14 días. Se considera que la persona que cumple con la cuarentena por el COVID-19 no representa un riesgo de propagación del virus porque durante el periodo de incubación no presentó la enfermedad."
"¿El virus que causa el COVID-19 se puede propagar a través de la comida, como la que pedimos en restaurantes para llevar, o los alimentos congelados o refrigerados?","En general se cree que los coronavirus se propagan de persona a persona a través de las gotitas respiratorias. En la actualidad no existe evidencia que respalde la transmisión de COVID-19 asociada a los alimentos. Antes de preparar o comer sus alimentos, siempre es importante lavarse las manos con agua y jabón por al menos 20 segundos, para garantizar la seguridad de los alimentos en general. Durante el día, use un pañuelo desechable para cubrirse al toser o estornudar, y lávese las manos después de sonar su nariz, toser o estornudar, o después de ir al baño.
Podría ser posible que una persona contraiga el COVID-19 al tocar una superficie u objeto, como un recipiente de empaque, que tenga el virus y luego se toque la boca, la nariz o posiblemente los ojos, aunque no se cree que esta sea la principal forma en que se propaga el virus.
Por lo general, como estos coronavirus sobreviven poco tiempo en las superficies, probablemente el riesgo de propagación a través de los alimentos y sus empaques sea bajo.
Conozca lo que se sabe acerca de la propagación del COVID-19."
¿Me puedo enfermar de COVID-19 si está en los alimentos?,"Con base en la información que tenemos hasta hoy sobre este nuevo coronavirus, parece poco probable que se pueda transmitir el COVID-19 a través de la comida, pero es necesario seguir investigando."
¿El clima cálido detendrá el brote del COVID-19?,"Todavía no se sabe si el clima y la temperatura inciden en la propagación del COVID-19. Algunos otros virus, como los que causan el resfriado común o la influenza (gripe), se propagan más en los meses de clima frío, pero eso no significa que sea imposible enfermarse a causa de estos virus durante otros meses.  Hay mucho más que aprender acerca de la transmisibilidad, gravedad y otras características asociadas al COVID-19, y las investigaciones están en curso."
¿Qué es la propagación en la comunidad?,"La propagación en la comunidad significa que las personas han sido infectadas por el virus en un área, incluidas algunas personas que no saben con certeza cómo ni dónde se infectaron."
¿Qué temperatura mata al virus que causa el COVID-19?,"Por lo general, los coronavirus sobreviven por períodos más cortos a temperaturas más altas y con más humedad que en entornos más fríos y secos. No obstante, no tenemos datos directos acerca de este virus, ni tampoco tenemos datos directos sobre una temperatura límite para la inactivación en este momento. La temperatura necesaria también se basará en el material de la superficie, el entorno, etc. Independientemente de la temperatura, siga las directrices de limpieza y desinfección de los CDC."
¿Los mosquitos o garrapatas pueden propagar el virus que causa el COVID-19?,"Por el momento, los CDC no tienen datos que sugieran que este nuevo coronavirus u otros coronavirus similares puedan propagarse a través de mosquitos o garrapatas. La principal forma de propagación del COVID-19 es de persona a persona. Vea Cómo se propaga el coronavirus para obtener más información."
¿Tengo riesgo de contraer el COVID-19 en los Estados Unidos?,Esta es una situación que evoluciona rápidamente y la  evaluación de riesgos  puede cambiar a diario. Las actualizaciones más recientes están disponibles en el sitio web de los CDC: Enfermedad del coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
¿Cuántos casos se notificaron en los Estados Unidos?,El recuento de casos de COVID-19 en los Estados Unidos se actualiza en línea en forma regular. Vea el recuento actual de casos de COVID-19 en los Estados Unidos.
¿Cómo puedo protegerme?,Visite la página de  Prevención y tratamiento del COVID-19 para obtener información sobre cómo protegerse de las enfermedades respiratorias como el COVID-19.
¿Qué debería hacer si estuve en contacto cercano con una persona que tiene COVID-19?,Hay información disponible en línea para las  personas que han tenido contacto cercano  con alguien a quien se le haya confirmado el COVID-19 o haya sido sometido a una evaluación para determinar si tiene la enfermedad.
¿Recomiendan los CDC el uso de mascarillas o protección facial para prevenir el COVID-19?,"A la luz de la nueva información acerca de la propagación del COVID-19, junto con la evidencia de transmisión extendida de COVID-19 en las comunidades del país, los CDC recomiendan que las personas usen una cubierta de tela para la cara para cubrir su nariz y boca en los entornos comunitarios. Es una medida de salud pública adicional que las personas deben adoptar para reducir la propagación del COVID-19, además de (y no en lugar de) las medidas de distanciamiento social, el lavado de manos frecuente y otras medidas preventivas cotidianas. El objetivo de una cubierta de tela para la cara no es proteger a quien la usa, sino que puede prevenir la transmisión del virus por parte de quien la usa a otras personas. Esto sería particularmente importante en caso de que una persona esté infectada pero no tenga síntomas. Las personas deben usar una cubierta de tela para la cara cada vez que van a un lugar público (como tiendas de comestibles, por ejemplo). Las mascarillas médicas y las mascarillas de respiración N-95 están reservadas para los trabajadores de la salud y otro personal de respuesta a emergencias, según las recomendaciones de las guías actuales de los CDC."
¿Tengo riesgo de contraer el COVID-19 a través de paquetes o productos enviados desde China?,"Todavía queda mucho por saber acerca del COVID-19 y cómo se propaga. Se cree que este coronavirus se propaga con mayor frecuencia a través de las gotitas respiratorias. Si bien el virus puede sobrevivir por un período corto en algunas superficies, es poco probable que se propague de productos o recipientes que son trasladados para su envío a lo largo de un período de días o semanas, a temperatura ambiente. Actualmente no hay evidencia que respalde la transmisión del COVID-19 asociada a productos importados y, en los Estados Unidos, no ha habido ningún caso de COVID-19 asociado a productos importados.  Se brindará información a través del sitio web La enfermedad del coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)  a medida que esté disponible."
¿Puedo donar sangre?,"La donación de sangre en los entornos de atención médica en los Estados Unidos es una parte esencial del cuidado de los pacientes, que salva vidas. Constantemente se necesitan donaciones de sangre, y los bancos de sangre están abiertos y necesitan donaciones con urgencia. Los CDC alientan a las personas que están bien de salud a que sigan donando sangre siempre que puedan hacerlo, incluso si están poniendo en práctica las medidas de distanciamiento social debido al COVID-19. Los CDC apoyan a los bancos de sangre brindándoles recomendaciones para preservar la seguridad del personal y los donantes. Algunos ejemplos de estas recomendaciones son mantener una distancia de 6 pies entre las sillas de los donantes, implementar completamente las prácticas de higiene ambiental  y alentar a los donantes a programar con antelación las citas para las donaciones."
¿Los usuarios de lentes de contacto deben tomar algún recaudo especial para prevenir el COVID-19?,"

Por el momento no hay evidencia que sugiera que los usuarios de lentes de contacto corren mayor riesgo de contraer COVID-19 que las personas que usan anteojos.
Las personas que usan lentes de contacto deben continuar con sus hábitos seguros de uso de lentes de contacto y de cuidado e higiene para ayudar a prevenir la transmisión de cualquier infección relacionada con el uso de lentes de contacto, como lavarse las manos siempre con agua y jabón antes de manipular los lentes.
Las personas sanas pueden seguir usando y cuidando sus lentes de contacto según las indicaciones de su oftalmólogo.

Vea más información acerca de cómo se propaga el coronavirus y cómo protegerse.
Visite el  sitio web de los CDC sobre lentes de contacto  para obtener más información sobre el uso y cuidado saludables de lentes de contacto."
¿La solución de desinfección de lentes de contacto es efectiva contra el COVID-19?,"

Los sistemas a base de peróxido de hidrógeno  que se usan para la limpieza, desinfección y para guardar los lentes de contacto deberían ser eficaces contra el virus que causa el COVID-19. 
En el caso de otros métodos de desinfección, como soluciones multipropósito o limpiadores ultrasónicos, por el momento no hay evidencia científica suficiente para determinar su eficacia contra el virus.


Siempre use solución para desinfectar sus lentes de contacto y el estuche a fin de matar los gérmenes que puedan tener.
Manipule sus lentes sobre una superficie que se pueda limpiar y desinfectar.

¿Cuál es el riesgo de que mi hijo contraiga COVID-19?,"Con base en la evidencia disponible, los niños no parecen correr mayor riesgo de contraer el COVID-19 que los adultos. Si bien algunos niños y bebés han contraído el COVID-19, la mayoría de los casos conocidos a la fecha son en adultos. Puede obtener más información acerca de quiénes corren mayor riesgo de enfermarse gravemente con COVID-19 en Personas con mayor riesgo de enfermedad grave."
¿Cómo puedo proteger a mi hijo del COVID-19?,"Puede alentar a su hijo a que ayude a detener la propagación del COVID-19 si le enseña a hacer las mismas cosas que debemos hacer todos para mantenernos sanos.

Evite el contacto cercano con personas que estén enfermas.
Quédese en casa si está enfermo, excepto para buscar atención médica.
Cúbrase la nariz y la boca con un pañuelo desechable cuando tosa o estornude y luego bótelo a la basura.
Lávese las manos frecuentemente con agua y jabón por al menos 20 segundos, especialmente después de sonarse la nariz, toser o estornudar; después de ir al baño; y antes de comer o preparar los alimentos.
Si no tiene agua y jabón, use un desinfectante de manos a base de alcohol que contenga al menos un 60 % de alcohol. Lávese siempre las manos con agua y jabón si están visiblemente sucias.
Limpie y desinfecte las superficies y objetos que se toca con frecuencia (como mesas, mesones, interruptores de luz, manijas de puertas y manijas de gabinetes).
Lave la ropa sucia e incluya los juguetes de peluche lavables, según corresponda y de acuerdo a las instrucciones del fabricante. De ser posible, lave los artículos usando la temperatura de agua máxima permitida y séquelos completamente. La ropa, sábanas y toallas sucias de una persona enferma se pueden lavar con las de las otras personas.

¿Son diferentes los síntomas del COVID-19 en niños y adultos?,"No. Los síntomas del COVID-19 son similares en niños y adultos. Sin embargo, los niños con diagnóstico de COVID-19 confirmado en general presentaron síntomas leves. Los síntomas informados en niños incluyen síntomas similares a los del resfriado, como fiebre, moqueo y tos. También se informaron vómitos y diarrea. Todavía no se sabe si hay algunos niños que podrían correr mayor riesgo de enfermarse gravemente, por ejemplo quienes tienen afecciones subyacentes y necesidades de atención médica especiales. Todavía queda mucho por aprender acerca de cómo afecta la enfermedad a los niños."
¿Deberían los niños usar mascarillas?,"CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community. Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation. Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. Esto es de suma importancia si alguien está infectado pero no presenta síntomas. Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance."
¿Cómo debo preparar a mis hijos por si se produce un brote de COVID-19 en nuestra comunidad?,"Los brotes pueden ser estresantes tanto para los adultos como para los niños. Hable con sus hijos acerca del brote, intente mantener la calma y recuérdeles que se encuentran a salvo. Si lo considera apropiado, explíqueles que la mayoría de los casos COVID-19 parecen ser leves. Los niños responden de manera diferente a las situaciones estresantes que los adultos. Los CDC ofrecen recursos para conversar con los niños acerca del COVID-19."
¿Qué medidas deben tomar los padres para proteger a sus hijos durante un brote en la comunidad?,"Este es un nuevo virus y aún estamos aprendiendo al respecto, pero hasta ahora, los niños no parecen resultar especialmente afectados. La mayoría de las enfermedades, incluidas las enfermedades graves, se presentan en adultos en edad activa y adultos mayores. Sin embargo, los niños sí pueden contraer el virus y enfermarse. Muchas escuelas del país anunciaron la suspensión de clases presenciales por períodos temporales. Manténgase informado acerca del cierre de escuelas en su comunidad. Lea o vea fuentes de información locales para estar al tanto del cierre de escuelas. Si las escuelas suspenden las clases de manera temporal, utilice otras alternativas de cuidado infantil, si es necesario.
Si alguno de sus hijos contrae el COVID-19, informe a su escuela o centro de cuidados infantiles. Hable con los maestros acerca de las tareas y actividades escolares que pueden hacer desde casa para mantenerse al día con sus estudios.
Evite que niños y adolescentes se reúnan en otros espacios públicos mientras las clases en la escuela estén suspendidas para ayudar a reducir la propagación del COVID-19 en la comunidad."
"Durante la suspensión de clases, ¿mis hijos pueden pasar tiempo con sus amigos?","

La clave para desacelerar la propagación del COVID-19 es poner en práctica el distanciamiento social. Mientras estén suspendidas las clases en las escuelas, los niños no deben juntarse en persona con niños de otras familias. Si los niños juegan fuera de sus casas, es esencial que se mantengan a una distancia de 6 pies de cualquier persona que no viva con ellos.
Para ayudar a los niños a mantener sus vínculos sociales durante el periodo de distanciamiento social, ayúdelos a realizar llamadas telefónicas o chats de video supervisados con sus amigos.
Asegúrese de que los niños tomen medidas preventivas cotidianas, como lavarse las manos frecuentemente con agua y jabón. Recuerde: si los niños se reúnen fuera de la escuela en grupo, pueden ponernos a todos en riesgo. 
Revise los planes de vacaciones de primavera si incluyen viajes que no sean estrictamente necesarios.


La información disponible acerca de  COVID-19 en niños  es algo limitada, pero los datos actuales sugieren que los niños con COVID-19 pueden tener síntomas leves. No obstante, pueden contagiar el virus a otras personas con un mayor riesgo, incluidos adultos mayores y personas que tengan afecciones subyacentes graves.

"Durante la suspensión de clases, ¿cómo puedo ayudar a mi hijo a seguir aprendiendo?","

Manténgase en contacto con la escuela de su hijo.

Muchas escuelas están ofreciendo lecciones en línea (aprendizaje virtual). Revise las asignaciones de la escuela, y ayude a su hijo a establecer un ritmo razonable para completar las tareas. Tal vez necesite ayudar a su hijo a encender los dispositivos, leer las instrucciones y escribir las respuestas.
Comunique a su escuela los desafíos que enfrente. Si tiene problemas de tecnología o conectividad, o si su hijo tiene dificultades para completar las tareas, avísele a la escuela.​​​​​​​


Cree un horario y una rutina para el aprendizaje en casa, pero no pierda la flexibilidad.

Implemente horarios regulares para irse a dormir, y levántense a la misma hora, de lunes a viernes.
Estructure el día para que incluya momentos de aprendizaje, tiempo libre, comidas y refrigerios saludables, además de actividad física.
Sea flexible con el horario: está bien adaptarlo según su día.


Considere las necesidades y ajustes requeridos para la edad de su hijo. 

La transición a estar en casa será diferente para los niños de edad prescolar, de kínder a 5.º grado, estudiantes de escuela secundaria media y estudiantes de escuela secundaria superior. Hable con su hijo sobre sus expectativas y cómo se están adaptando a estar en casa en vez de la escuela.
Piense de qué manera su hijo puede mantenerse conectado con sus amigos sin estar con ellos en persona.


Busque maneras de hacer que el aprendizaje sea divertido.

Realicen actividades prácticas, como rompecabezas, pinturas, dibujos y manualidades.
También puede usar el juego independiente en lugar del aprendizaje estructurado. Aliente a los niños a construir un fuerte con sábanas o practique los números al apilar bloques.
Practiquen habilidades de escritura y gramática al escribir cartas a los miembros de la familia. Esta es una excelente manera de conectarse y limitar el contacto directo.
Comiencen un diario con su hijo para documentar este momento y hablen sobre la experiencia compartida.
Use audiolibros o vea si su biblioteca local está realizando eventos de lectura virtuales o transmitidos en vivo.



"
"Durante la suspensión de clases, ¿los niños tendrán acceso a las comidas?",Consulte con su escuela para saber si continuarán con los servicios de comidas durante la suspensión de clases. Muchas escuelas están manteniendo abiertos sus establecimientos para permitir que las familias recojan comidas o están entregando comidas para llevar en una ubicación central.
"Durante la suspensión de clases, ¿cómo puedo mantener sana a mi familia?","

Vigile a su hijo para detectar cualquier signo de enfermedad.

Si ve cualquier signo de enfermedad compatible con los síntomas del COVID-19, en particular fiebre, tos o dificultad para respirar, llame a su proveedor de atención médica y mantenga a su hijo en casa y alejado de otras personas tanto como sea posible. Siga las directrices de los CDC detalladas en ""Qué hacer si está enfermo.”


Esté atento a la aparición de indicios de estrés en su hijo.

Algunos cambios de conducta a los que debería estar atento incluyen preocupación o tristeza excesivas, hábitos de alimentación o sueño no saludables, y problemas de atención y concentración. Para obtener más información, consulte la sección ""Para padres"" en el sitio web de los CDC Maneje la ansiedad y el estrés.
Tómese un tiempo para hablar con su hijo pequeño o adolescente acerca del brote de COVID-19. Responda preguntas y difunda información acerca del COVID-19 de manera comprensible para su hijo pequeño o adolescente.
Visite las páginas de los CDC  Cómo ayudar a los niños a sobrellevar las emergencias o Cómo hablar con los niños sobre el COVID-19 para obtener más información.


Enseñe y refuerce las medidas preventivas cotidianas.

Los padres y cuidadores desempeñan un rol importante a la hora de enseñar a los niños a lavarse las manos. Explíqueles que el lavado de manos puede mantenerlos sanos y evitar que el virus se propague a otras personas.
Sea un buen ejemplo: si usted se lava las manos con frecuencia, es más probable que ellos hagan lo mismo.
Convierta el lavado de manos en una actividad familiar.


Ayude a su hijo a mantenerse activo.

Aliente a su hijo a jugar en espacios exteriores: es excelente para su salud física y mental. Salga a caminar con su hijo o den un paseo en bicicleta.
Haga pausas durante las actividades en interiores (pausas para hacer ejercicios de estiramiento, pausas para bailar) a lo largo del día para ayudar a su hijo a mantenerse saludable y concentrado.


Ayude a su hijo a mantenerse conectado socialmente.

Hablen con amigos y familiares por teléfono o chats de video.
Escriban cartas o tarjetas para los miembros de la familia que no pueden visitar.
Algunas escuelas y organizaciones sin fines de lucro, como Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learningícono de sitio externoícono de sitio externo y The Yale Center for Emotional Intelligenceícono de sitio externoícono de sitio externo, tienen recursos de aprendizaje social y emocional. Consulte si su escuela ofrece consejos y directrices para ayudar a satisfacer las necesidades sociales y emocionales de su hijo.

"Durante la suspensión de clases, límite el tiempo que pasa con adultos mayores, incluidos familiares, y personas con afecciones crónicas.","Los adultos mayores y las personas con afecciones subyacentes graves corren un mayor riesgo si se enferman con el COVID-19.

Si otras personas de su hogar tienen un riesgo particularmente alto de enfermarse gravemente con el COVID-19, considere tomar precauciones adicionales para separar a su hijo de esas personas.
Si no puede permanecer en su hogar con su hijo durante la suspensión de clases, piense detenidamente quién podría ser la persona más indicada para cuidarlo. Si alguien con un mayor riesgo de presentar complicaciones por el COVID-19 será quien lo cuide (adulto mayor, como un abuelo o una persona con alguna afección subyacente grave), limite el contacto de sus hijos con otras personas.
Considere posponer las visitas o viajes para ver a los abuelos o familiares de edad avanzada. Conéctese de manera virtual, o escriba cartas y envíelas por correo.

¿Debo usar agua y jabón o desinfectante de manos para protegerme del COVID-19?,"El lavado de manos es una de las mejores maneras de protegerse y proteger a su familia de las enfermedades.  Lávese las manos frecuentemente con agua y jabón por al menos 20 segundos, especialmente después de sonarse la nariz, toser o estornudar; después de ir al baño; y antes de comer o preparar los alimentos. Si no tiene agua y jabón, use un desinfectante de manos a base de alcohol que contenga al menos un 60 % de alcohol."
¿Qué productos de limpieza debería usar para protegerme del COVID-19?,"Limpie y desinfecte las superficies que se tocan con frecuencia, como mesas, manijas de puertas, interruptores de luz, mesones, tiradores, escritorios, teléfonos, teclados, inodoros, grifos o llaves, lavamanos y lavaplatos.​​​​​​​  Si las superficies están sucias, límpielas con detergente o agua y jabón antes de desinfectarlas. Para desinfectar, la mayoría de los desinfectantes comunes para el hogar, registrados en la EPA, funcionarán. Vea las recomendaciones de los CDC para la limpieza y desinfección del hogar."
¿Debo fabricar mi propio desinfectante de manos si no logro encontrarlo en las tiendas?,"


Los CDC recomiendan lavarse las manos con agua y jabón por al menos 20 segundos, o usar un desinfectante de manos a base de alcohol con al menos un 60 % de alcohol si no dispone de agua y jabón. Estas acciones son parte de las medidas preventivas diarias que las personas pueden tomar para desacelerar la propagación de enfermedades respiratorias como el COVID-19.

Al lavarse las manos, puede usar jabón común o jabón antibacteriano. El jabón común es tan efectivo como el jabón antibacteriano para eliminar los gérmenes.
Si no dispone de agua y jabón, puede usar un desinfectante para manos a base de alcohol aprobado por la FDA que contenga al menos un 60 % de alcohol. Para saber si el desinfectante contiene al menos un 60 % de alcohol, lea la etiqueta del producto.

Manténgase en contacto con otras personas por teléfono o correo electrónico. Si tiene alguna enfermedad crónica y vive solo, pídale a su familia, amigos y proveedores de atención médica que estén pendientes de usted durante el brote. Manténgase en contacto con familiares y amigos, en especial con quienes corren mayor riesgo de enfermarse gravemente, como adultos mayores y personas con afecciones crónicas graves.

"
¿Se suspenderán las clases en las escuelas si se produce un brote en mi comunidad?,"Según la situación, los funcionarios de salud pública podrían recomendar medidas en la comunidad para reducir la exposición al COVID-19, como la suspensión de clases en las escuelas. Lea o vea fuentes de información locales para estar al tanto del cierre de escuelas, y esté pendiente de las comunicaciones de la escuela de su hijo. Si se suspenden las clases en las escuelas de manera temporal, recomiéndeles a los estudiantes y al personal que no se reúnan ni socialicen en ningún lugar, como la casa de un amigo, un restaurante favorito o el centro comercial local."
¿Debería ir a trabajar si se produce un brote en mi comunidad?,"Siga las recomendaciones de los funcionarios de salud locales. Permanezca en su casa si puede hacerlo. Hable con su empleador para solicitar trabajar desde casa o tomarse una licencia si usted o algún miembro de su familia se enferma y presenta síntomas del COVID-19, o si la escuela de su hijo cierra de manera temporal. Los empleadores deben tener en cuenta que una mayor cantidad de empleados probablemente necesite permanecer en su hogar para cuidar a sus hijos u otro familiar enfermo en caso de producirse un brote en la comunidad."
"¿Las empresas y escuelas de mi comunidad cerrarán o permanecerán cerradas? ¿Durante cuánto tiempo? ¿Se impondrá la orden de ""quedarse en casa"" o ""refugiarse en el lugar"" en mi comunidad?","Los CDC hacen recomendaciones, comparten información y brindan directrices para ayudar a desacelerar la propagación del COVID-19 en los EE. UU., incluidas directrices para escuelas y empresas. Los CDC comparten información con regularidad y brindan asistencia a las autoridades de salud estatales, locales, territoriales y tribales. Estas autoridades locales están a cargo de la toma de decisiones, incluidas las órdenes de ""quedarse en casa"" o ""refugiarse en el lugar"".

¿Dónde puedo realizarme la prueba de detección del COVID-19?,"El proceso y los sitios donde se hacen las pruebas varían de un lugar a otro. Comuníquese con su departamento estatal, local, tribal o territorial para obtener más información, o consulte a un proveedor médico. Los departamentos de salud pública estatales y locales han recibido pruebas de parte de los CDC mientras diferentes proveedores médicos están obteniendo pruebas desarrolladas por fabricantes comerciales. Aunque se está incrementando el suministro de estas pruebas, aún puede ser difícil encontrar algún lugar para realizarse la prueba. Vea Pruebas para detectar el COVID-19  para obtener más información."
¿Puede una persona dar negativo en una prueba de detección del COVID-19 y más adelante dar positivo?,"Si se utiliza la prueba de diagnóstico elaborada por los CDC, un resultado negativo significa que en la muestra de la persona no se encontró el virus que causa el COVID-19. En las primeras etapas de la infección, es posible que no se detecte el virus.
En el caso del COVID-19, un resultado negativo en la prueba con la muestra tomada mientras la persona tiene síntomas probablemente significa que el virus del COVID-19 no es el causante de la enfermedad."
¿Quiénes tienen mayor riesgo de enfermarse gravemente a causa del COVID-19?,"El COVID-19 es una enfermedad nueva y se cuenta con información limitada acerca de los factores de riesgo de enfermarse gravemente. Con base en la información disponible actualmente y la experiencia clínica, los adultos mayores y las personas de cualquier edad que tienen afecciones subyacentes graves podrían tener un mayor riesgo de enfermarse gravemente a causa del COVID-19.
Con base en lo que sabemos ahora, quienes tienen un mayor riesgo de enfermarse gravemente con el COVID-19 son:

Personas de 65 años de edad o más
Personas que viven en un hogar de ancianos o en un establecimiento de cuidados a largo plazo

Las personas de todas las edades con afecciones subyacentes, en especial si no están bien controladas, entre ellas:

Personas con enfermedad pulmonar crónica o asma moderada a grave
Personas con afecciones cardiacas graves
Personas con su sistema inmunitario deprimido 
Muchas afecciones pueden causar que el sistema inmunitario se debilite (inmunodeprimido), como el tratamiento contra el cáncer, fumar, un trasplante de órgano o médula espinal, las deficiencias inmunitarias, el control inadecuado del VIH o SIDA y el uso prolongado de corticosteroides y otros medicamentos que debilitan el sistema inmunitario


Personas con obesidad grave (índice de masa corporal [IMC] ≥40)
Personas con diabetes
Personas con enfermedad renal crónica en tratamiento de diálisis
Personas con enfermedad hepática

"
¿Qué deberían hacer las personas con mayor riesgo de enfermarse gravemente a causa del COVID-19?,"Si corre mayor riesgo de enfermarse gravemente a causa del COVID-19, debe hacer lo siguiente:

Abastézcase de suministros
Tome precauciones cotidianas para mantener el espacio que lo separa de otras personas
Cuando sale, manténgase alejado de otras personas enfermas
Limite el contacto cercano y lávese las manos con frecuencia
Evite las multitudes, los cruceros y cualquier viaje que no sea estrictamente necesario

Si hay un brote en su comunidad, permanezca en su casa todo el tiempo que sea posible. Esté atento a los síntomas y signos de emergencia. Si se enferma, quédese en su casa y llame al médico.

Lo que estamos aprendiendo del brote en otros países y en los Estados Unidos.​​​​​​​
Lo que sabemos acerca del riesgo por otras infecciones respiratorias, como la influenza (gripe).

A medida que los CDC reciban más información acerca de los casos de COVID-19 en los Estados Unidos, actualizaremos el listado según sea necesario."
¿Hay algún medicamento que no debo tomar si tengo COVID-19?,"
Por el momnto no existe evidencia de que tomar ibuprofeno o naproxeno pueda agravar la infección por COVID-19.
Las personas con hipertensión deben tomar sus medicamentos para la presión arterial según las indicaciones y estar en contacto con su proveedor de atención médica para garantizar que su presión arterial se mantenga tan controlada como sea posible. Solo su proveedor de atención médica puede modificar los medicamentos que debe tomar.
"
¿Qué sucede con las afecciones médicas subyacentes que no están incluidas en esta lista?,"Según la información disponible, los adultos de 65 años de edad en adelante y las personas de cualquier edad con afecciones subyacentes incluidas en esta lista tienen un mayor riesgo de enfermarse gravemente y de tener peores resultados a causa del COVID-19. Los CDC están recopilando y analizando datos de manera regular y actualizarán la lista cuando obtengan más información. Las personas con afecciones subyacentes que no figuran en la lista también pueden tener mayor riesgo y deben consultar con su proveedor de atención médica si esto les preocupa.
Alentamos a todas las personas, independientemente de su nivel de riesgo, a:

Tomar medidas para protegerse y proteger a los demás.
Llame a su proveedor de atención médica si tiene  enfermo fiebre, tos o dificultad para respirar. 
Seguir las directrices de los CDC para viajes y las recomendaciones de los funcionarios de salud estatales y locales.

"
¿Qué significa una afección bien controlada?,"En general, bien controlado significa que su afección está estable, que no pone en peligro su vida, y que las evaluaciones de laboratorio y otros hallazgos son lo más similares posible a las de quienes no tienen esa afección.​​​​​​​ Debe hablar con su proveedor de atención médica si tiene alguna pregunta acerca de su salud o sobre cómo se está manejando su afección."
¿Qué significa enfermedad más grave?,"Por lo general, la gravedad indica el nivel de impacto que tiene la enfermedad o afección en el funcionamiento de su organismo.  Debe hablar con su proveedor de atención médica si tiene alguna pregunta acerca de su salud o sobre cómo se está manejando su afección."
¿Tienen un riesgo mayor las personas con discapacidades?,"La mayoría de las personas con discapacidades no tiene inherentemente un riesgo mayor de contraer el virus o de enfermarse gravemente con el COVID-19.  Algunas personas con limitaciones físicas u otras discapacidades podrían tener un mayor riesgo de infección debido a su afección subyacente.

Las personas con ciertas discapacidades podrían experimentar tasas más altas de afecciones crónicas que incrementen su riesgo de enfermarse gravemente y de tener peores resultados a causa del COVID-19. Los adultos con discapacidades tienen el triple de probabilidades de sufrir enfermedades cardiacas, accidentes cerebrovasculares, diabetes o cáncer que los adultos sin discapacidades.

Debe hablar con su proveedor de atención médica si tiene alguna pregunta acerca de su salud o sobre cómo se está manejando su afección."
¿Qué deberían hacer los profesionales de atención médica y los departamentos de salud?,"Para obtener recomendaciones y directrices sobre personas bajo investigación, control de infecciones —incluidas las directrices sobre equipos de protección personal—, cuidado en el hogar y aislamiento, e investigación de casos, consulte información para profesionales de atención médica. Para obtener información sobre la recolección y el envío de muestras, consulte la  información para laboratorios.  Para obtener información sobre el COVID-19 para profesionales de la salud pública, consulte la  información para profesionales de salud pública."
¿Estoy en riesgo si asisto a un funeral o velatorio de un fallecido por COVID-19?,Por el momento no existe un riesgo conocido asociado al hecho de estar en la misma sala en la que se está velando el cuerpo de alguien que falleció a causa del COVID-19 o en su funeral.
¿Estoy en riesgo si toqué el cuerpo de un fallecido por COVID-19?,"El COVID-19 es una enfermedad nueva y aún estamos aprendiendo cómo se propaga. Se cree que el virus que causa el COVID-19 se propaga principalmente a través del contacto cercano (es decir, a una distancia de hasta aproximadamente 6 pies) con una persona que tenga en ese momento la enfermedad del coronavirus (COVID-19). El virus se propaga principalmente a través de gotitas respiratorias que se producen cuando una persona infectada tose o estornuda, del mismo modo que se propagan la influenza y otras infecciones de las vías respiratorias. Estas gotitas pueden terminar en la boca o en la nariz de quienes se encuentran cerca o posiblemente ser inhaladas y llegar a los pulmones. Este tipo de propagación no ocurre después de que la persona haya muerto.
Podría ser posible que una persona contraiga el COVID-19 al tocar una superficie u objeto que tenga el virus y luego se toque la boca, la nariz o posiblemente los ojos, aunque no se cree que esta sea la principal forma en que se propaga el virus.
Las personas deberían considerar no tocar el cuerpo de alguien que murió a causa del COVID-19. Las personas mayores y las personas de todas las edades con afecciones graves subyacentes tienen un mayor riesgo de presentar un cuadro grave de COVID-19. Es posible que existan menos probabilidades de que el virus se propague a través de ciertos tipos de contacto, como sostener la mano del difunto o darle un abrazo después de que el cuerpo haya sido preparado para el velatorio. En lo posible, deberían evitarse otros tipos de actividades como besar, lavar y amortajar al difunto antes de que el cuerpo haya sido preparado, durante la preparación y posteriormente. Si lavar el cuerpo o amortajar al difunto es una práctica cultural o religiosa importante, se recomienda a las familias que consulten con sus líderes religiosos o culturales de la comunidad y con el personal de la casa funeraria sobre cómo reducir su exposición lo más que se pueda. Como mínimo, las personas que realizan estas actividades deberían usar guantes desechables. Si existe la posibilidad de que se produzcan salpicaduras de líquidos corporales, es necesario usar un equipo de protección personal (EPP) adicional (como bata desechable, protector facial o gafas de protección y mascarilla de respiración N-95).
La limpieza debería realizarse siguiendo las instrucciones del fabricante de cada producto de limpieza y desinfección (p. ej., concentración, método de aplicación y tiempo de contacto). Con base en datos de virus más difíciles de eliminar, los productos aprobados por la EPA que indican que son efectivos contra patógenos virales emergentesícono de pdfícono de sitio externoícono de pdfícono de sitio externo  deberían ser efectivos contra el COVID-19. Después de quitarse el EPP, es necesario realizar la higiene de manos que consiste en lavarse las manos con agua y jabón durante 20 segundos como mínimo o usar un desinfectante de manos a base de alcohol que contenga al menos un 60 % de alcohol en caso de que no se disponga de agua y jabón. Se debe usar agua y jabón si las manos están visiblemente sucias.  "
¿Qué deben saber los trabajadores de casas funerarias acerca del manejo de personas fallecidas a causa del COVID-19?,"Se puede realizar un funeral o velatorio de alguien que murió a causa del COVID-19. Los trabajadores de funerarias deben cumplir con las precauciones de rutina para el control y la prevención de infecciones cuando manipulen el cuerpo de una persona que falleció por COVID-19. Si es necesario poner un cuerpo en una bolsa mortuoria, tome las  precauciones estándares, incluido el uso de equipo de protección personal (EPP) adicional en caso de que se prevean salpicaduras de líquidos corporales. Para trasladar un cuerpo que fue colocado en una bolsa mortuoria, desinfecte el exterior de la bolsa con un  producto aprobado por la EPA como eficaz para combatir patógenos virales emergentesícono de pdfícono de sitio externoícono de pdfícono de sitio externo que, con base en datos de virus más difíciles de eliminar, debería resultar eficaz para eliminar el COVID-19. Siga las instrucciones del fabricante para cada uno de los productos de limpieza y desinfección (p. ej., concentración, método de aplicación y tiempo de contacto, etc.). Use guantes desechables de nitrilo para manipular la bolsa mortuoria.
Puede realizarse el embalsamamiento del cuerpo. Durante el embalsamamiento, tome las precauciones estándares que incluyen el uso de EPP adicional en caso de que haya salpicaduras (p. ej., bata desechable, protector facial o gafas de protección y mascarilla de respiración N95). Utilice la protección respiratoria adecuada si alguno de los procedimientos generará aerosoles o si se indica en la etiqueta del fabricante del producto químico que se usará. Use guantes resistentes sobre los guantes desechables de nitrilo si hay riesgo de cortes, heridas punzantes u otras lesiones cutáneas. Hay más información sobre cómo realizar procedimientos que generen aerosoles de forma segura en las  directrices post mortem de los CDC. La limpieza debería realizarse siguiendo las instrucciones del fabricante. Con base en datos de virus más difíciles de eliminar, los productos aprobados por la EPA que indican que son efectivos contra patógenos virales emergentesícono de pdfícono de sitio externoícono de pdfícono de sitio externo  deberían ser efectivos contra el COVID-19. Siga las instrucciones del fabricante para cada uno de los productos de limpieza y desinfección (p. ej., concentración, método de aplicación y tiempo de contacto).
Después de la limpieza y tras quitarse el EPP, es necesario realizar  la higiene de manos  que consiste en lavarse las manos con agua y jabón durante 20 segundos como mínimo o usar un desinfectante de manos a base de alcohol que contenga al menos un 60 % de alcohol en caso de que no se disponga de agua y jabón. Se debe usar agua y jabón si las manos están visiblemente sucias.  
Los muertos por COVID-19 pueden ser sepultados o cremados, pero consulte si existe algún requisito adicional a nivel local y estatal que pudiera determinar el manejo y la disposición de los restos humanos de las personas que murieron a causa de ciertas enfermedades infecciosas."
¿Qué debería hacer si un familiar muere a causa del COVID-19 en el extranjero?,"Cuando un ciudadano estadounidense muere fuera de los Estados Unidos, el familiar más cercano o el representante legal de la persona fallecida debería informar al respecto a los funcionarios consulares de los EE. UU. en el Departamento de Estado. El personal consular está disponible las 24 horas del día, los 7 días de la semana para brindar asistencia a los ciudadanos estadounidenses en caso de una emergencia en el extranjero. Si el miembro de la familia, pareja de hecho o representante legal se encuentra en un país diferente al de la persona fallecida, deberá llamar a la Oficina de Servicios para Ciudadanos en el Exterior del Departamento de Estado en Washington, DC, de lunes a viernes de 8 a. m. a 5 p. m., hora del este, al 888-407-4747 (número gratuito) o 202-501-4444. En caso de necesitar asistencia de emergencia fuera del horario laboral o  durante los fines de semana y feriados, comuníquese con el Departamento de Estado a través del 202-647-4000 y solicite hablar con el funcionario de guardia de Servicios para Ciudadanos en el Exterior. Además, la Embajada de los EE. UU.ícono de sitio externoícono de sitio externoícono de sitio externo en el país o cerca del país donde murió el ciudadano estadounidense puede brindarle asistencia."
Un familiar murió a causa del COVID-19 mientras estaba en el extranjero. ¿Cuáles son los requisitos para trasladar el cuerpo a los Estados Unidos?,"Los CDC no exigen que se realice una autopsia antes de que los restos de una persona que falleció en el extranjero sean trasladados a los Estados Unidos. Según las circunstancias del fallecimiento, algunos países pueden exigir que se realice una autopsia. Entre otros, la familia puede pedir ayuda al consulado o la embajada local, al proveedor del seguro de viajes, al operador turístico,  a organizaciones de fe y humanitarias, y al empleador del difunto. Probablemente será necesario realizar la identificación oficial del cuerpo y presentar los documentos oficiales emitidos por la oficina consular.
Los requisitos de los CDC para la importación de restos humanos dependen de si el cuerpo ha sido embalsamado o cremado, o de si la persona murió a causa de una  enfermedad contagiosa que requiere cuarentena.
En este momento en los Estados Unidos, el COVID-19 es una enfermedad contagiosa que requiere cuarentena y los restos humanos deben cumplir con los estándares de importación incluidos en el Título 42 del Código de Regulaciones Federales, Parte 71.55, y el ingreso a los Estados Unidos se puede aprobar y autorizar solo si se cumplen con las siguientes condiciones:

Los restos son cremados; O
Los restos son debidamente embalsamados y colocados en un ataúd sellado herméticamente; O
Los restos humanos van acompañados de un permiso emitido por el director de los CDC. Durante el traslado, los restos humanos deben ir acompañados en todo momento del permiso de los CDC (si corresponde). 
Los permisos para la repatriación de los restos de una persona cuya causa de muerte, ya sea confirmada o presunta, es una enfermedad contagiosa que requería cuarentena pueden obtenerse a través de la División de Migración Global y Cuarentena de los CDC, llamando al Centro de Operaciones de Emergencia de los CDC al 770-488-7100 o enviando un mensaje electrónico a dgmqpolicyoffice@cdc.gov.



Consulte las  directrices de los CDC  para obtener más información."
¿Qué están haciendo los CDC respecto del COVID-19?,"Los CDC están trabajando junto a otros socios federales en una respuesta conjunta que incluye a todo el gobierno. Esta es una situación emergente de rápida evolución y los CDC continuarán brindando información actualizada a medida que esté disponible. Los CDC trabajan las 24 horas del día, los 7 días de la semana para proteger la salud de las personas. En línea, puede consultar más información sobre la  respuesta de los CDC frente al COVID-19 ."
¿Puedo contraer el COVID-19 de mis mascotas u otros animales?,"En este momento, no hay evidencia que demuestre que los animales de compañía, incluidas las mascotas, puedan propagar el COVID-19 a las personas o que puedan ser una fuente de infección en los Estados Unidos. A la fecha, los CDC no han recibido ningún informe sobre mascotas que se enfermaron de COVID-19 en los Estados Unidos.
Las mascotas tienen otros tipos de coronavirus que pueden enfermarlos, como los coronavirus caninos y felinos. Estos otros coronavirus no pueden infectar a las personas y no están relacionados con el brote actual de COVID-19.
No obstante, dado que estos animales pueden contagiar otras enfermedades a las personas, siempre resulta recomendable practicar hábitos saludables con las mascotas y otros animales, como lavarse las manos y mantener un buen nivel de higiene. Para obtener más información sobre la cantidad de beneficios de la tenencia de mascotas y cómo mantenerse sanos y salvos entre los animales, incluidas las mascotas, el ganado y la fauna silvestre, visite el sitio web de los CDC  Mascotas sanas, personas sanas."
¿Necesito realizarle una prueba de detección del COVID-19 a mi mascota?,No. Por el momento no se recomiendan las pruebas de detección de COVID-19 en animales.
¿Pueden los animales ser portadores del virus que causa el COVID-19 por medio de su piel o pelaje?,"Por el momento, no existe ninguna evidencia de que el virus que causa el COVID-19 pueda transmitirse a las personas a través de la piel o el pelaje de las mascotas.
Hable con su veterinario para conocer la mejor manera de cuidar de su mascota."
¿Debería evitar el contacto con mascotas u otros animales si tengo la enfermedad del coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)?,"Si contrae COVID-19, debería restringir el contacto con las mascotas y otros animales del mismo modo que lo haría con otras personas. Si bien no hubo informes de mascotas que se enfermaron con COVID-19 en los Estados Unidos, igual se recomienda que las personas enfermas con COVID-19 limiten el contacto con animales hasta que se conozca más información acerca del nuevo coronavirus. Si es posible, mientras esté enfermo deje sus mascotas bajo el cuidado de otro familiar. Si contrajo el COVID-19, evite estar en contacto con su mascota y compartir comida, así como también evite las caricias, los arrumacos, los besos o ser lamido. Si está enfermo y tiene que cuidar a su mascota o estar rodeado de animales, lávese las manos antes y después de interactuar con ellos."
¿Es seguro adoptar una mascota de un refugio?,"No hay motivos para pensar que los animales, incluidas las mascotas de refugios, en los Estados Unidos podrían ser una fuente de COVID-19."
¿Qué pasa con los animales o los productos animales importados?,"Los CDC no tienen ninguna evidencia que indique que los animales o los productos animales importados representen un riesgo de propagación del COVID-19 en los Estados Unidos.  Esta es una situación que cambia rápidamente y la información se actualizará a medida que esté disponible. Los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC) de los EE. UU., el Departamento de Agricultura de los EE. UU. (USDA) y el Servicio Federal de Pesca y Vida Silvestre (FWS) de los EE. UU. cumplen funciones diferentes, pero complementarias, en cuanto a la reglamentación de la importación de animales vivos y productos animales a los Estados Unidos.  Los CDC regulan los animales y productos de origen animal que ponen en riesgo la salud humana, la USDA regulaícono de sitio externoícono de sitio externo los animales y productos de origen animal que ponen en riesgo la agricultura, y el FWS regulaícono de sitio externoícono de sitio externo la importación de especies y vida silvestre en peligro de extinción que podrían ocasionar daños a la salud y el bienestar de los seres humanos, los intereses de los sectores agrícolas, de horticultura y forestales y el bienestar y supervivencia de los recursos de vida silvestre."
¿Puedo viajar a los Estados Unidos con perros o importar perros a este país durante el brote de COVID-19?,"Consulte los requisitos de los CDC para traer a un perro a los Estados Unidos. Los requisitos de vacunación contra la rabia  actuales se aplican a los perros importados de China, un país que tiene un alto riesgo de rabia."
"¿Qué precauciones deberían tomarse para los animales que han sido importados recientemente desde fuera de los Estados Unidos (por ejemplo, por refugios, grupos de rescate o como mascotas personales)?","Los animales importados deben reunir los CDC y USDAícono de sitio externoícono de sitio externo requisitos de ingreso a los Estados Unidos. En este momento, no hay evidencias que demuestren que los animales domésticos, incluidas las mascotas y animales de servicio, puedan propagar el COVID-19. Al igual que con cualquier animal que se introduce en un nuevo entorno, los animales importados recientemente deberían estar bajo observación diaria para detectar signos de enfermedad. Si un animal se enferma, debería ser examinado por un veterinario. Llame a su clínica veterinaria local antes de acudir con su animal e infórmeles que trajo a su animal recientemente del extranjero.
Esta es una situación que cambia rápidamente y la información se actualizará a medida que esté disponible."
Chủng vi-rút corona mới là gì?,"Vi-rút corona mới là loại vi-rút corona mới chưa từng được phát hiện trước đây. Vi-rút gây ra bệnh vi-rút corona 2019 (COVID-19), không cùng loại vi-rút corona thường lan truyền ở người và gây ra bệnh nhẹ, giống như cảm lạnh thông thường.
Chẩn đoán với vi-rút corona 229E, NL63, OC43, hoặc HKU1 không giống với chẩn đoán COVID-19. Bệnh nhân mắc COVID-19 sẽ được đánh giá và chăm sóc khác với các bệnh nhân được chẩn đoán mắc vi-rút corona thông thường."
"Tại sao bệnh này lại được gọi là bệnh vi-rút corona 2019, COVID-19?","Vào ngày 11 tháng 2 năm 2020 Tổ chức Y tế Thế giới đã thông báo tên chính thức của căn bệnh gây ra sự bùng phát vi-rút corona mới 2019, được phát hiện lần đầu tại Vũ Hán, Trung Quốc. Tên mới của bệnh này là bệnh vi-rút corona 2019, viết tắt là COVID-19. Trong chữ COVID-19, 'CO' viết tắt của từ 'corona,' 'VI' viết tắt của từ 'vi-rút,' và 'D' là bệnh. Trước đó, căn bệnh này được gọi là ""vi-rút corona mới 2019"" hoặc ""nCoV-2019"".
Có nhiều loại vi-rút corona ở người bao gồm một số loại thường gây ra các bệnh đường hô hấp trên nhẹ. COVID-19 là căn bệnh mới, do vi-rút corona mới gây ra, loại này trước đây chưa từng thấy ở người. Tên của bệnh này đã được chọn theo phương pháp thực hành tốt nhấtbiểu tượng bên ngoàibiểu tượng bên ngoài của Tổ chức Y tế Thế giới (WHO) cho việc đặt tên cho các bệnh truyền nhiễm mới ở người."
Tại sao một ai đó có thể đổ lỗi hoặc tránh những cá nhân hoặc nhóm nào đó (gây kỳ thị) vì COVID-19?,"Người dân Hoa Kỳ có thể lo lắng hoặc cảm thấy bất an về bạn bè và người thân đang sinh sống hoặc tới thăm khu vực đang lây lan COVID-19. Một số người lo lắng về việc mắc bệnh từ những người này. Sợ hãi và lo lắng có thể dẫn đến sự kỳ thị xã hội, ví dụ, đối với những người sống ở một số vùng nhất định trên thế giới, những người đã đi du lịch quốc tế, những người đã từng bị cách ly hoặc các chuyên gia chăm sóc sức khỏe.
Kỳ thị là sự phân biệt đối xử đối với nhóm người, một địa điểm hoặc một quốc gia có thể xác định được. Sự kỳ thị liên quan tới việc thiếu kiến thức về cách lây lan của COVID-19, nhu cầu đổ lỗi cho một ai đó, nỗi sợ hãi về căn bệnh và sự chết chóc cũng như tin đồn lan truyền về những điều vô căn cứ, không có thật.
Sự kỳ thị làm tổn thương tất cả mọi người bằng cách tạo thêm sự sợ hãi hoặc tức giận đối với người bình thường thay vì tập trung vào bệnh đang gây ra vấn đề."
Làm cách nào để mọi người có thể chặn đứng kỳ thị liên quan tới COVID-19?,Mọi người có thể chống lại sự kỳ thị bằng cách có sự hỗ trợ xã hội trong các tình huống mà quý vị nhận thấy điều này đang xảy ra. Sự kỳ thị ảnh hưởng đến sức khỏe tâm thần hoặc cảm xúc của các nhóm người bị kỳ thị và cộng đồng mà họ sống ở đó. Ngăn chặn sự kỳ thị là rất quan trọng để giúp cho cộng đồng và các thành viên trong cộng đồng có khả năng vượt qua. Xem thông tin về sức khỏe tâm thần và cách ứng phó trong khi diễn ra COVID-19. Mọi người đều có thể giúp ngăn chặn sự kỳ thị liên quan đến COVID-19 bằng việc biết sự thật và chia sẻ sự thật với những người khác trong cộng đồng.
Vì sao số ca bệnh COVID-19 ở một số tiểu bang đôi khi khác với thông tin được đăng trên trang web của CDC?,Tổng số ca bệnh của CDC được kiểm chứng thông qua quy trình xác nhận với các khu vực phân quyền. Quy trình được sử dụng để tìm và xác nhận các ca bệnh được hiển thị ở những nơi khác nhau có thể khác nhau.
Số ca bệnh COVID-19 của CDC so sánh như thế nào với số ca bệnh do Tổ chức Y tế Thế giới (WHO) hoặc Johns Hopkins cung cấp?,"Số ca bệnh COVID-19 của CDC bao gồm nhiều số được báo cáo công khai, bao gồm thông tin từ các đối tác tiểu bang, địa phương, vùng lãnh thổ, quốc tế và bên ngoài."
Tại sao số ca bệnh vào những ngày trước tăng?,"Sự chậm trễ trong báo cáo có thể khiến số ca bệnh COVID-19 được báo cáo vào những ngày trước tăng lên. (Đôi khi hiệu ứng này được mô tả là ""san lấp"".) Các sở y tế tiểu bang, địa phương và vùng lãnh thổ báo cáo số ca bệnh đã được xác nhận và chia sẻ dữ liệu này với CDC. Vì phải mất thời gian để thực hiện xét nghiệm trong phòng thí nghiệm, số ca bệnh từ ngày hôm trước có thể được cộng vào số ca bệnh hàng ngày trễ vài ngày sau đó."
Nguồn của vi-rút này là gì?,"COVID-19 là do một loại vi-rút corona có tên SARS-CoV-2 gây ra. Vi-rút corona là một họ vi-rút lớn phổ biến ở người và nhiều loài động vật khác nhau, bao gồm lạc đà, gia súc, mèo và dơi.  Trong trường hợp hiếm gặp, vi-rút corona ở động vật có thể lây nhiễm cho người và sau đó lây lan từ người sang người. Điều này đã xảy ra với MERS-CoV và SARS-CoV, và giờ đây với vi-rút gây ra COVID-19. Thông tin thêm về nguồn và sự lây lan của COVID-19 có trên Tóm tắt tình hình: Nguồn và sự lây lan của vi-rút."
Vi-rút lây lan như thế nào?,"Vi-rút gây ra COVID-19 được cho là lây lan chủ yếu từ người sang người, chủ yếu thông qua các giọt bắn từ đường hô hấp được tạo ra khi người nhiễm bệnh ho hoặc hắt hơi. Những giọt bắn này có thể vương vào miệng hoặc mũi của những người ở gần đó hoặc có thể bị hít vào phổi. Sự lây lan có nhiều khả năng khi mọi người tiếp xúc gần với nhau (trong khoảng 6 feet hoặc 2 mét).
COVID-19 dường như lây lan dễ dàng và kéo dài trong cộng đồng (""lây lan trong cộng đồng"") tại&nbspnhiều khu vực địa lý bị ảnh hưởng. Lây lan trong cộng đồng nghĩa là mọi người bị lây nhiễm vi-rút trong một khu vực, bao gồm cả một số đối tượng không biết rõ họ đã bị lây nhiễm ở đâu và bằng cách nào.
Tìm hiểu những gì đã biết về sự lây lan của vi-rút corona mới xuất hiện."
Tại sao số ca bệnh đang tăng lên?,Số ca bệnh COVID-19 được báo cáo tại Hoa Kỳ đang tăng lên do số xét nghiệm trong phòng thí nghiệm tăng lên và báo cáo trên toàn quốc. Số ca bệnh đang tăng lên một phần phản ánh sự lây lan nhanh chóng của COVID-19 khi rất nhiều lãnh thổ và tiểu bang của Hoa Kỳ đang xảy ra tình trạng lây truyền cộng đồng. Dữ liệu chi tiết và chính xác hơn sẽ cho phép chúng ta hiểu rõ hơn và theo dõi quy mô cũng như phạm vi bùng phát dịch bệnh và củng cố các nỗ lực phòng ngừa và phản ứng.
Một người đã nhiễm COVID-19 có thể lây bệnh cho người khác không?,"Vi-rút gây ra COVID-19 đang lây lan từ người sang người. Một người được cho là dễ lây nhiễm nhất khi họ có triệu chứng (bệnh nặng nhất). Đó là lý do CDC khuyến cáo những bệnh nhân này nên được cách ly tại bệnh viện hoặc tại nhà (tùy vào mức độ bệnh của họ) cho đến khi họ khỏe hơn hoặc không còn nguy cơ lây nhiễm cho người khác. Gần đây, vi-rút cũng được phát hiện thấy ở những người không có triệu chứng.
Thời gian một người mắc bệnh tích cực có thể thay đổi, do đó quyết định khi nào sẽ ngừng cách ly người này được đưa ra thông qua chiến lược dựa trên xét nghiệm hoặc không dựa trên xét nghiệm (nghĩa là thời gian kể từ khi bệnh bắt đầu và thời gian kể từ khi hồi phục) cùng với tư vấn của nhân viên y tế công cộng của tiểu bang và địa phương. Quyết định liên quan đến việc xem xét các chi tiết cụ thể của từng tình huống, bao gồm mức độ nghiêm trọng của bệnh, các dấu hiệu và triệu chứng bệnh và kết quả xét nghiệm của phòng thí nghiệm cho bệnh nhân đó.
Tìm hiểu thêm về Hướng dẫn của CDC về thời điểm ngừng cô lập một người và cho xuất viện bệnh nhân mắc COVID-19. Để biết thông tin về thời điểm người mắc bệnh COVID-19 có thể ngừng cô lập tại nhà, xem Hướng dẫn tạm thời về việc ngừng cô lập tại nhà cho bệnh nhân mắc COVID-19.
Người đã hết cách ly không còn được coi là có nguy cơ lây nhiễm cho người khác."
Người đã bị cách ly vì COVID-19 có thể lây nhiễm bệnh cho người khác không?,"Cách ly nghĩa là tách người đó hoặc một nhóm người đã tiếp xúc với bệnh truyền nhiễm nhưng chưa phát triển bệnh (triệu chứng) khỏi  người khác, những người chưa tiếp xúc để phòng ngừa khả năng lây lan căn bệnh đó. Cách ly thường được thiết lập trong thời gian ủ bệnh là thời kỳ bệnh có thể gây lây nhiễm, là khoảng thời gian mà người đó sẽ phát bệnh sau khi phơi nhiễm. Với COVID-19, thời gian cách ly là 14 ngày kể từ ngày phơi nhiễm cuối cùng vì thời gian ủ bệnh của vi-rút này là từ 2 đến 14 ngày. Người được chấm dứt cách ly COVID-19 không còn được coi là có nguy cơ lây lan vi-rút cho người khác vì họ đã không phát triển bệnh trong thời gian ủ bệnh."
"Vi-rút gây ra COVID-19 có thể lây lan qua thực phẩm, bao gồm cả đồ ăn mang đi từ nhà hàng, thực phẩm đóng gói trong tủ lạnh hoặc đông lạnh không?","Vi-rút corona thường được cho là lây từ người sang người qua các giọt bắn từ đường hô hấp. Hiện tại, không có bằng chứng nào hỗ trợ cho việc lây truyền COVID-{[# 0]} liên quan đến thực phẩm. Trước khi chuẩn bị đồ ăn hoặc ăn uống, điều quan trọng là luôn rửa tay bằng xà phòng và nước trong ít nhất 20 giây để đảm bảo an toàn thực phẩm nói chung. Trong suốt cả ngày, hãy dùng khăn giấy để che miệng khi ho hoặc hắt hơi, và rửa tay sau khi xì mũi, ho hoặc hắt hơi hoặc đi vệ sinh.
Một người có thể mắc COVID-19 khi chạm vào bề mặt hoặc đồ vật, như bao bì đóng gói, có vi-rút trên đó và sau đó chạm vào miệng, mũi hoặc có thể là mắt, nhưng đây không phải là cách lây lan chính của vi-rút.
Nói chung, do khả năng sống sót kém của vi-rút corona trên bề mặt, nên rất ít có khả năng lây lan vi-rút từ các sản phẩm thực phẩm hoặc bao bì.
Tìm hiểu những gì đã biết về sự lây lan của COVID-19."
Tôi có thể mắc bệnh với COVID-19 nếu vi-rút có trên thực phẩm không?,"Dựa trên thông tin về vi-rút corona mới này cho đến nay, có vẻ như COVID-19 không thể lây truyền qua thực phẩm - chúng ta cần phải nghiên cứu thêm."
Liệu thời tiết ấm có thể ngăn chặn việc bùng phát COVID-19?,"Chúng ta vẫn chưa biết liệu thời tiết và nhiệt độ có ảnh hưởng đến sự lây lan của COVID-19 hay không. Một số loại vi-rút khác, như vi-rút gây cảm lạnh và cúm thông thường, lây lan nhiều hơn trong những tháng thời tiết lạnh nhưng điều đó không có nghĩa là không thể mắc bệnh với những vi-rút này trong những tháng khác.  Vẫn còn rất nhiều thứ cần được tìm hiểu về khả năng lây truyền, tính chất nghiêm trọng và các đặc tính khác liên quan tới  COVID-19. Hiện tại các cuộc nghiên cứu vẫn đang tiếp diễn."
Lây lan trong cộng đồng là gì?,"Lây lan trong cộng đồng nghĩa là mọi người bị lây nhiễm vi-rút trong một khu vực, bao gồm cả một số đối tượng không biết rõ họ đã bị lây nhiễm ở đâu và bằng cách nào."
Nhiệt độ nào giết chết vi-rút gây ra COVID-19?,"Nói chung, vi-rút corona tồn tại trong thời gian ngắn hơn ở nhiệt độ cao và độ ẩm cao hơn trong môi trường mát hơn hoặc khô hơn. Tuy nhiên, tại thời điểm này, chúng tôi không có dữ liệu chính xác cho vi-rút này và chúng tôi cũng không có dữ liệu chính xác về giới hạn nhiệt độ mà vi-rút sẽ không còn hoạt động. Nhiệt độ cần thiết cũng sẽ dựa trên các vật liệu của bề mặt, môi trường, v.v. Bất kể nhiệt độ như thế nào, hãy làm theo Hướng dẫn làm sạch và khử trùng của CDC."
Muỗi hay ve có thể truyền vi-rút gây bệnh COVID-19 không?,"Tại thời điểm này, CDC không có dữ liệu nào cho thấy muỗi hoặc ve lây lan loại vi-rút corona mới này hoặc các loại vi-rút corona tương tự khác. Cách chính mà COVID-19 lây lan là từ người sang người. Xem Vi-rút corona lây lan như thế nào để biết thêm thông tin."
Tôi có nguy cơ mắc COVID-19 tại Hoa Kỳ không?,Đây là một tình huống phát đang triển nhanh chóng và đánh giá nguy cơ có thể thay đổi hàng ngày. Thông tin cập nhật mới nhất có sẵn trên trang web về Bệnh vi-rút corona 2019 (COVID-19) của CDC.
Có bao nhiêu ca bệnh đã được báo cáo tại Hoa Kỳ?,Số ca bệnh COVID-19 tại Hoa Kỳ được cập nhật trực tuyến thường xuyên. Xem số ca bệnh COVID-19 hiện tại ở Hoa Kỳ.
Tôi có thể bảo vệ bản thân bằng cách nào?,Truy cập trang Phòng ngừa và điều trị COVID-19 để tìm hiểu về cách bảo vệ bản thân khỏi các bệnh về đường hô hấp như COVID-19.
Tôi nên làm gì nếu tôi có sự tiếp xúc gần với người mắc COVID-19?,"Thông tin có trên mạng cho những người đã tiếp xúc gần với người được xác nhận đã nhiễm, hoặc đang được khám xem có nhiễm COVID-19."
CDC có khuyến nghị sử dụng khẩu trang hoặc khẩu trang vải để ngăn ngừa COVID-19 không?,"Dựa trên dữ liệu mới về sự lây lan của COVID-19, cùng với bằng chứng về bệnh COVID-19 lan rộng trong cộng đồng trên toàn quốc, CDC khuyến nghị mọi người nên đeo khẩu trang vải để che mũi và miệng trong môi trường cộng đồng. Đây là một biện pháp y tế công cộng bổ sung mà mọi người nên thực hiện để giảm sự lây lan của COVID-19 bên cạnh (chứ không phải thay thế) các biện pháp cách ly giao tiếp xã hội, làm sạch tay thường xuyên và các hành động phòng ngừa hàng ngày khác. Khẩu trang vải không nhằm bảo vệ người đeo, nhưng có thể ngăn chặn sự lây lan vi-rút từ người đeo sang người khác. Điều này đặc biệt quan trọng trong trường hợp có người bị lây nhiễm nhưng không có các triệu chứng. Nên đeo khâu trang vải bất cứ khi nào mọi người phải vào các nơi công cộng (ví dụ như cửa hàng thực phẩm). Khẩu trang y tế và mặt nạ N-95 dành riêng cho nhân viên y tế và những người ứng phó đầu tiên khác, theo khuyến nghị của hướng dẫn CDC hiện tại."
Tôi có nguy cơ nhiễmr COVID-19 từ bao bì hoặc sản phẩm được vận chuyển Trung Quốc sang không? ,"Vẫn còn rất nhiều điều chưa biết về COVID-19 và cách lây lan của vi-rút. Vi-rút corona này được cho là lây lan thường xuyên nhất bởi các giọt bắn từ đường hô hấp. Mặc dù vi-rút có thể tồn tại trong một thời gian ngắn trên một số bề mặt, nhưng vi-rút ít có khả năng lây lan từ các sản phẩm hoặc bao bì được vận chuyển trong một vài ngày hoặc vài tuần ở nhiệt độ môi trường. Hiện chưa có bằng chứng nào cho thấy việc lây truyền COVID-19 có liên quan tới hàng hóa nhập khẩu và chưa có trường hợp nào mắc COVID-19 tại Hoa Kỳ có liên quan tới hàng hóa nhập khẩu. Thông tin sẽ được cung cấp trên trang web Bệnh vi-rút corona 2019 (COVID-19) khi có sẵn."
Tôi có thể hiến máu không?,"Trong các cơ sở chăm sóc sức khỏe trên khắp Hoa Kỳ, hiến tặng máu là một phần cứu cánh, thiết yếu cho việc chăm sóc bệnh nhân. Nhu cầu hiến máu là không đổi, và các trung tâm máu mở cửa và rất cần sự hiến máu. CDC khuyến khích những người khỏe mạnh tiếp tục hiến máu nếu có thể, ngay cả khi họ đang thực hành cách ly xã hội vì COVID-19. CDC hỗ trợ các trung tâm máu bằng cách đưa ra các khuyến nghị giữ an toàn cho những người hiến máu và nhân viên. Ví dụ về các khuyến nghị này bao gồm đặt ghế của người hiến máu cách nhau 6 feet tương đương khoảng 2 mét, tuân thủ triệt để các biện pháp vệ sinh môi trường và khuyến khích người hiến máu đặt lịch hẹn hiến máu từ trước."
Người đeo kính áp tròng có nên thực hiện các biện pháp phòng ngừa đặc biệt để ngăn ngừa COVID-19 không?,"

Hiện tại không có bằng chứng nào cho thấy người đeo kính áp tròng có nguy cơ mắc COVID-19 cao hơn so với người đeo kính mắt.
Người đeo kính áp tròng nên tiếp tục thực hành thói quen vệ sinh về chăm sóc và đeo kính áp tròng an toàn để giúp tránh lây nhiễm bất kỳ bệnh nhiễm trùng nào liên quan đến kính áp tròng, như luôn rửa tay bằng xà phòng và nước trước khi thao tác với kính áp tròng.
Những người khỏe mạnh có thể tiếp tục đeo và chăm sóc kính áp tròng theo quy định của chuyên gia nhãn khoa.

Dung dịch khử trùng kính áp tròng có hiệu quả với COVID-19 không?,"

Các dung dịch dùng hydro peroxide để làm sạch, khử trùng và lưu trữ kính áp tròng cũng có hiệu quả đối với vi-rút gây ra COVID-19. 
Đối với các phương pháp khử trùng khác, như dung dịch đa năng và chất tẩy rửa siêu âm, hiện tại không có đủ bằng chứng khoa học để xác định hiệu quả chống lại vi-rút.


Luôn sử dụng dung dịch để khử trùng kính áp tròng và hộp đựng để tiêu diệt vi trùng có thể có.
Xử lý kính áp tròng trên bề mặt đã được làm sạch và khử trùng.

Nguy cơ con tôi mắc bệnh COVID-19 là như thế nào?,"Dựa trên bằng chứng sẵn có, trẻ em dường như không có nguy cơ mắc bệnh COVID-19 cao hơn so với người lớn. Mặc dù một số trẻ em và trẻ sơ sinh đã mắc bệnh COVID-19, người lớn chiếm hầu hết các ca bệnh đã biết cho đến nay. Bạn có thể tìm hiểu thêm về những người có nguy cơ cao mắc bệnh nghiêm trọng từ COVID-19 tại Những người có nguy cơ cao mắc bệnh nghiệm trọng."
Tôi có thể bảo vệ con tôi tránh bị nhiễm COVID-19 như thế nào?,"Quý vị có thể khuyến khích con mình giúp ngăn chặn sự lây lan của COVID-19 bằng cách dạy chúng làm những điều tương tự mà mọi người nên làm để giữ sức khỏe.

Tránh tiếp xúc gần với người bị bệnh.
Ở nhà khi quý vị mắc bệnh, trừ khi cần chữa bệnh.
Che miệng khi ho và hắt hơi bằng khăn giấy và ném khăn giấy vào thùng rác.
Rửa tay thường xuyên bằng xà phòng và nước trong ít nhất 20 giây, đặc biệt là sau khi xì mũi, ho hoặc hắt hơi; sau khi vào phòng vệ sinh; và trước khi ăn hoặc chuẩn bị thức ăn.
Nếu xà phòng và nước không có sẵn, hãy sử dụng dung dịch sát trùng tay chứa cồn có độ cồn ít nhất là 60%. Luôn rửa tay bằng xà phòng và nước nếu tay bẩn rõ ràng.
Làm sạch và khử trùng các bề mặt và đồ vật thường xuyên chạm vào (ví dụ: bàn, mặt bếp, công tắc đèn, tay nắm cửa và tay cầm tủ).
Giặt đồ, bao gồm đồ chơi bằng vải lông có thể giặt được, một cách phù hợp và theo hướng dẫn của nhà sản xuất. Nếu có thể, hãy giặt đồ sử dụng cài đặt nhiệt độ cao nhất thích hợp cho món đồ đó và sấy đồ khô hoàn toàn. Có thể giặt đồ bẩn của người bệnh cùng với đồ của người khác.

Thông tin thêm về Trẻ em và bệnh vi-rút corona 2019 (COVID-19) có trên mạng."
Các triệu chứng của COVID-19 ở trẻ em có khác với người lớn không?,"Không. Các triệu chứng của COVID-19 tương tự ở trẻ em và người lớn. Tuy nhiên, trẻ em được xác nhận mắc bệnh COVID-19 thường có các triệu chứng nhẹ. Các triệu chứng được báo cáo ở trẻ em bao gồm các triệu chứng giống như cảm lạnh, chẳng hạn như sốt, sổ mũi và ho. Nôn và tiêu chảy cũng đã được báo cáo. Vẫn chưa biết liệu một số trẻ em có thể có nguy cơ mắc bệnh nghiêm trọng cao hơn hay không, ví dụ, trẻ em có các bệnh tiềm ẩn và các nhu cầu chăm sóc sức khỏe đặc biệt. Có nhiều điều hơn nữa cần tìm hiểu về việc bệnh ảnh hưởng như thế nào đến trẻ em."
Có nên cho trẻ em đeo khẩu trang không?,"CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community. Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation. Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.
Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. Điều này đặc biệt quan trọng nếu người nào đó nhiễm bệnh nhưng không có triệu chứng. Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance."
Tôi chuẩn bị cho con tôi như thế nào trong trường hợp bùng phát COVID-19 trong cộng đồng tôi?,"Bùng phát có thể gây căng thẳng cho người lớn và trẻ em. Nói chuyện với con quý vị về sự bùng phát, cố gắng giữ bình tĩnh và trấn an chúng rằng chúng vẫn an toàn. Nếu thích hợp, hãy giải thích cho chúng rằng hầu hết bệnh từ COVID-19 đều có vẻ nhẹ. Trẻ em phản ứng với các tình huống căng thẳng khác với người lớn. CDC cung cấp thông tin để giúp nói chuyện với trẻ em về COVID-19."
Cha mẹ nên thực hiện những bước gì để bảo vệ trẻ em trong khi dịch bùng phát tại cộng đồng?,"Đây là một loại vi-rút mới và chúng tôi vẫn đang tìm hiểu về nó, nhưng cho đến nay, dường như không có nhiều trẻ em mắc bệnh. Hầu hết các bệnh, bao gồm cả bệnh nghiêm trọng, đang xảy ra ở người lớn trong độ tuổi lao động và người cao tuổi. Tuy nhiên, trẻ em có thể nhiễm vi-rút và mắc bệnh. Nhiều trường học trên cả nước đã tuyên bố đóng cửa trong thời gian tạm thời. Hãy theo dõi các trường học đóng cửa trong cộng đồng của quý vị. Đọc hoặc xem các nguồn phương tiện truyền thông tại địa phương thông báo về việc đóng cửa trường học. Nếu trường đóng cửa tạm thời, hãy sử dụng các phương thức trông trẻ khác, nếu cần.
Nếu con/các con của quý vị mắc bệnh COVID-19, hãy thông báo cho cơ sở trông trẻ hoặc trường học của chúng. Trao đổi với giáo viên về bài tập và hoạt động trong lớp học mà chúng có thể làm ở nhà để theo kịp việc học tập ở trường.
Không khuyến khích trẻ em và thanh thiếu niên tụ tập ở những nơi công cộng khác trong khi trường học đóng cửa để giúp làm chậm sự lây lan của COVID-19 trong cộng đồng."
"Khi trường học đóng cửa, con tôi có thể đi chơi với bạn bè không?","

Điểm mấu chốt để làm chậm sự lây lan của COVID-19 là thực hành cách ly giao tiếp xã hội. Trong khi trường học đóng cửa, trẻ em không nên có những cuộc vui chơi gặp mặt trực tiếp với trẻ em từ các hộ gia đình khác. Nếu trẻ chơi bên ngoài nhà mình, phải bảo đảm duy trì khoảng cách 6 feet tương đương 2 mét giữa chúng với bất kỳ ai không phải là người trong gia đình.
Để giúp trẻ duy trì các kết nối xã hội trong khi cách ly giao tiếp xã hội, hãy giúp con quý vị có các cuộc gọi điện thoại hoặc trò chuyện video có sự giám sát với bạn bè.
Đảm bảo rằng trẻ em thực hành những hành động phòng ngừa hàng ngày chẳng hạn như rửa tay thường xuyên bằng xà phòng và nước. Hãy nhớ rằng, nếu trẻ em gặp nhau ngoài trường theo nhóm, điều đó có thể khiến mọi người gặp nguy cơ. 
Sửa đổi kế hoạch nghỉ xuân nếu kế hoạch này bao gồm việc du lịch không cần thiết.


Thông tin về COVID-19 ở trẻ em có phần hạn chế, nhưng dữ liệu hiện tại cho thấy trẻ em mắc COVID-19 có thể chỉ biểu hiện các triệu chứng nhẹ. Tuy nhiên, chúng vẫn có thể truyền vi-rút này sang cho người khác, những người thuộc nhóm đối tượng có nguy cơ cao hơn, bao gồm người cao tuổi và những người có bệnh nền nghiêm trọng.

Are there any medications I should avoid taking if I have COVID-19?,"
Currently, there is no evidence to show that taking ibuprofen or naproxen can lead to a more severe infection of COVID-19.
People with high blood pressure should take their blood pressure medications, as directed, and work with their healthcare provider to make sure that their blood pressure is as well controlled as possible. Any changes to your medications should only be made by your healthcare provider.
"
Có thông tin gì về các bệnh nền không có trong danh sách này không?,"Dựa trên thông tin có sẵn, người lớn từ 65 tuổi trở lên và những người ở mọi lứa tuổi có các bệnh nền trong danh sách này có rủi ro cao hơn mắc bệnh nghiêm trọng và hậu quả xấu hơn hơn từ COVID-19. CDC đang thu thập và phân tích dữ liệu thường xuyên và sẽ cập nhật danh sách khi chúng tôi tìm hiểu thêm. Những người có các bệnh nền không có trong danh sách cũng có thể có rủi ro cao hơn và nên tham khảo ý kiến ​​với nhà cung cấp dịch vụ chăm sóc sức khỏe nếu thấy lo ngại.
Chúng tôi khuyến khích tất cả mọi người, bất kể rủi ro như thế nào:

Thực hiện các bước để bảo vệ bản thân và những người khác.
Gọi nhà cung cấp dịch vụ chăm sóc sức khỏe nếu quý vị mắc bệnh kèm sốt, ho hoặc hụt hơi.
Thực hiện theo các hướng dẫn của CDC về du lịch và các khuyến cáo của viên chức y tế của tiểu bang và địa phương.

"
Tình trạng sức khỏe được kiểm soát tốt có nghĩa là gì?,"Nói chung, kiểm soát tốt có nghĩa là tình trạng của quý vị ổn định, không đe dọa tính mạng và các đánh giá trong phòng xét nghiệm và các phát hiện khác tương tự như với những người không có bệnh. Quý vị nên nói chuyện với nhà cung cấp dịch vụ chăm sóc sức khỏe nếu có câu hỏi về sức khỏe của mình hoặc tình trạng sức khỏe của mình đang được quản lý như thế nào."
Bệnh nghiêm trọng hơn có nghĩa là gì?,Nghiêm trọng thường có nghĩa là bệnh hoặc tình trạng ảnh hưởng đến chức năng cơ thể của quý vị nhiều đến mức nào.  Quý vị nên nói chuyện với nhà cung cấp dịch vụ chăm sóc sức khỏe nếu có câu hỏi về sức khỏe của mình hoặc tình trạng sức khỏe của mình đang được quản lý như thế nào.
Những người khuyết tật có nguy cơ cao hơn không?,"Hầu hết những người khuyết tật vốn không có rủi cao hơn bị nhiễm hoặc mắc bệnh nghiêm trọng từ COVID-19.  Một số người có giới hạn về thể chất hoặc khuyết tật khác có thể có rủi ro lây nhiễm cao hơn vì bệnh nền của họ.

Những người bị khuyết tật nhất định có thể có tỷ lệ có bệnh mãn tính cao hơn khiến họ có nguy cơ mắc bệnh nghiêm trọng cao hơn và hậu quả xấu hơn hơn từ COVID-19. Người lớn bị khuyết tật có nguy cơ mắc bệnh tim, đột quỵ, tiểu đường hoặc ung thư cao gấp ba lần so với người lớn không bị khuyết tật.

Quý vị nên nói chuyện với nhà cung cấp dịch vụ chăm sóc sức khỏe nếu có câu hỏi về sức khỏe của mình hoặc tình trạng sức khỏe của mình đang được quản lý như thế nào."
Các sở y tế và chuyên viên chăm sóc y tế nên làm gì?,"Để biết các khuyến cáo và hướng dẫn đối với người đang được theo dõi; kiểm soát lây nhiễm, bao gồm hướng dẫn về trang bị bảo hộ cá nhân, chăm sóc và cách ly tại nhà; và nghiên cứu ca bệnh, hãy xem mục Thông tin dành cho các Chuyên Viên Y Tế. Để biết thông tin về việc thu thập và vận chuyển mẫu bệnh phẩm, hãy xem mục Thông tin dành cho các Phòng thí nghiệm. Để biết thông tin cho chuyên gia y tế công cộng về COVID-19, xem Thông tin cho chuyên gia y tế công cộng."
Tôi có bị rủi ro nếu tới dự tang lễ hoặc đám viếng ai đó bị chết do COVID-19 không?,Hiện thời người ta vẫn chưa rõ về nguy cơ liên quan tới việc ở cùng phòng tại tang lễ hoặc đám viếng với thi thể người đã chết vì COVID-19.
Tôi có bị rủi ro nếu chạm vào người đã chết vì COVID-19 sau khi họ qua đời không?,"COVID-19 là một bệnh mới chúng tôi vẫn đang tìm hiểu cách lây lan của bệnh. Người ta cho rằng vi-rút gây ra COVID-19 chủ yêu lây lan qua tiếp xúc gần (nghĩa là trong khoảng cách 6 thước Anh tương đương khoảng 2 mét) với người hiện đang bị bệnh vì COVID-19. Vi-rút có thể lây lan chủ yếu qua các giọt bắn từ đường hô hấp của người bị nhiễm khi họ ho hoặc hắt hơi, giống như cách lây lan bệnh cúm và các bệnh lây nhiễm qua đường hô hấp khác. Những giọt bắn này có thể vương vào miệng hoặc mũi của những người ở gần đó hoặc có thể bị hít vào phổi. Loại lây lan này không phải là mối lo ngại sau khi chết.
Một người có thể nhiễm COVID-19 khi chạm tay vào bề mặt hoặc đồ vật có dính vi-rút trên đó, sau đó lại chạm vào miệng, mũi hoặc mắt của họ. Tuy nhiên người ta không cho rằng đây là con đường chính lây lan vi-rút.
Mọi người nên cân nhắc không chạm vào thi thể người chết vì COVID-19. Người cao niên và những người thuộc mọi độ tuổi đang có bệnh nghiêm trọng tiềm ẩn là đối tượng có nguy cơ phát triển COVID-19 nghiêm trọng cao hơn. Có thể ít có khả năng lây lan vi-rút qua một số hình thức tiếp xúc như nắm tay hoặc ôm sau khi thi thể đã được chuẩn bị để mọi người thăm viếng. Nếu có thể, những hoạt động khác như hôn, tắm rửa và khâm liệm nên tránh trước, trong và sau khi thi thể đã được chuẩn bị. Nếu việc tắm rửa thân thể hoặc khâm liệm là những nghi thức tôn giáo hoặc văn hóa quan trọng, các gia đình được khuyến khích thảo luận với người phụ trách văn hóa và tôn giáo trong cộng đồng và nhân viên nhà tang lễ về cách giảm phơi nhiễm càng nhiều càng tốt. Ít nhất thì những người thực hiện các hoạt động này cần đeo găng tay dùng một lần. Nếu có khả năng dịch bắn ra, có thể cần thêm trang bị bảo hộ cá nhân (PPE) (như áo choàng dùng một lần, tấm che mặt hoặc kính bảo hộ mắt và mặt nạ N-95).
Phải tiến hành việc làm sạch theo hướng dẫn của nhà sản xuất tất cả các sản phẩm làm sạch và khử trùng (ví dụ: nồng độ, phương pháp dùng và thời gian tiếp xúc). Sản phẩm tuyên bố chống được mầm bệnh vi-rút mới nổi được EPA phê chuẩnbiểu tượng pdfbiểu tượng bên ngoàipdf iconbiểu tượng bên ngoài được kỳ vọng có hiệu quả chống lại COVID-19 dựa trên dữ liệu về những sản phẩm khác khó diệt vi-rút hơn. Sau khi tháo trang bị bảo hộ cá nhân, thực hiện vệ sinh tay bằng cách rửa tay bằng xà phòng và nước trong ít nhất 20 giây hoặc sử dụng dung dịch sát trùng tay chứa cồn có chứa ít nhất 60% cồn nếu không có xà phòng và nước. Nên dùng xà phòng và nước nếu thấy tay bị bẩn."
Nhân viên nhà tang lễ cần biết gì về cách xử lý người quá cố nhiễm COVID-19?,"Tang lễ hoặc đám viếng có thể được tổ chức cho người đã mất vì nhiễm COVID-19. Nhân viên nhà tang lễ nên tuân thủ các biện pháp phòng ngừa và kiểm soát lây nhiễm khi xử lý người quá cố vì nhiễm COVID-19. Nếu cần thiết phải chuyển thi thể vào trong túi đựng, hãy làm theo Các Biện Pháp Phòng Ngừa Tiêu Chuẩn, bao gồm sử dụng thêm trang bị bảo hộ cá nhân (PPE) nếu thấy có thể có dịch bắn ra. Để vận chuyển cơ thể sau khi đã đưa cơ thể vào túi, hãy khử trùng bên ngoài túi bằng sản phẩm có tuyên bố chống lại mầm bệnh vi-rút mới xuất hiện được EPA phê chuẩnbiểu tượng pdfbiểu tượng bên ngoàibiểu tượng pdfbiểu tượng bên ngoài dự kiến có hiệu quả chống lại COVID-19 dựa trên dữ liệu về các sản phẩm khác khó diệt virus hơn. Tuân thủ hướng dẫn của nhà sản xuất đối với tất cả các sản phẩm vệ sinh và khử trùng (vd. nồng độ, phương pháp sử dụng và thời gian tiếp xúc, v.v.). Đeo găng  tay nitril dùng một lần khi xử lý túi đựng thi thể.
Có thể tiến hành ướp xác. Trong quá trình ướp xác, hãy tuân thủ các biện pháp Phòng ngừa Tiêu chuẩn bao gồm sử dụng thêm trang bị bảo hệ cá nhân (PPE) nếu có thể có dịch bắn ra (ví dụ: áo choàng dùng một lần, tấm che mặt hoặc kính bảo hộ mắt và mặt nạ N95). Đeo các dụng cụ bảo vệ hô hấp thích hợp nếu có bất kỳ quy trình nào tạo ra hóa chất hoặc nếu cần đối với các hóa chất sử dụng theo nhãn chỉ dẫn của nhà sản xuất. Đeo găng tay bảo hộ lao động bên ngoài găng tay nitril dùng một lần nếu có nguy cơ xảy ra các vết cắt, vết thương hở hay các thương tổn khác làm rách da. Thông tin bổ sung về cách xử lý an toàn trong các quy trình tạo giọt lơ lửng trong không khí có trong Hướng dẫn xử lý sau khi chết của CDC. Nên tiến hành việc lau dọn vệ sinh theo hướng dẫn của nhà sản xuất Sản phẩm tuyên bố chống được mầm bệnh vi-rút mới nổi được EPA phê chuẩnbiểu tượng pdfbiểu tượng bên ngoàipdf iconbiểu tượng bên ngoài được kỳ vọng có hiệu quả chống lại COVID-19 dựa trên dữ liệu về những sản phẩm khác khó diệt vi-rút hơn. Làm theo hướng dẫn của nhà sản xuất cho tất cả các sản phẩm làm sạch và khử trùng (ví dụ: nồng độ, phương pháp dùng và thời gian tiếp xúc).
Sau khi làm sạch và tháo trang bị bảo hộ cá nhân, thực hiện vệ sinh tay bằng cách rửa tay bằng xà phòng và nước trong ít nhất 20 giây hoặc sử dụng dung dịch sát trùng tay chứa cồn có chứa ít nhất 60% cồn nếu không có xà phòng và nước. Nên dùng xà phòng và nước nếu thấy tay bị bẩn.
Người quá cố vì nhiễm COVID-19 có thể được chôn hoặc hỏa táng, nhưng cần kiểm tra các yêu cầu bổ sung của địa phương và tiểu bang có thể quy định việc xử lý và hủy bỏ hài cốt của người đã mất vì một số bệnh truyền nhiễm nhất định."
Tôi nên làm gì nếu gia đình mình có thành viên chết vì nhiễm COVID-19 khi ở nước ngoài?,"Khi công dân Hoa Kỳ chết ngoài lãnh thổ Hoa Kỳ, người thân hoặc đại diện pháp lý của người quá cố cần thông báo với nhân viên lãnh sự Hoa Kỳ tại Bộ Ngoại Giao. Nhân viên lãnh sự sẽ có mặt 24 giờ mỗi ngày, 7 ngày mỗi tuần để cung cấp trợ giúp cho công dân Hoa Kỳ đang gặp sự cố khẩn cấp ở nước ngoài. Nếu thành viên gia đình, bạn đời hoặc đại diện pháp lý ở quốc gia khác với người quá cố, họ cần gọi cho Văn phòng Dịch vụ hỗ trợ công dân ở hải ngoại của Bộ Ngoại Giao tại Thủ đô Washington, từ 8 giờ sáng đến 5 giờ chiều giờ miền Đông, từ thứ 2 đến hết thứ 6, theo số máy 888-407-4747 (số miễn phí) hoặc 202-501-4444. Trong trường hợp cần được hỗ trợ khẩn cấp ngoài giờ làm việc hoặc vào dịp cuối tuần và kỳ nghỉ lễ, hãy gọi cho tổng đài của Bộ Ngoại Giao theo số máy 202-647-4000 và đề nghị được nói chuyện với nhân viên trực của Văn phòng Dịch vụ Hỗ trợ Công dân ở Hải ngoại. Ngoài ra, Sứ quán Hoa Kỳbiểu tượng bên ngoàibiểu tượng bên ngoàibiểu tượng bên ngoài gần nhất hoặc tại quốc gia nơi công dân Hoa Kỳ qua đời có thể có sự trợ giúp."
Gia đình tôi có thành viên chết vì nhiễm COVID-19 khi ở nước ngoài. Các yêu cầu để đưa thi thể về Hoa Kỳ là gì?,"CDC không yêu cầu khám nghiệm tử thi trước khi thi hài người chết ở nước ngoài được đưa hồi hương về Hoa Kỳ. Tùy vào tình hình liên quan tới cái chết đó, một số quốc gia có thể yêu cầu khám nghiệm tử thi. Một số nguồn hỗ trợ cho gia đình bao gồm đại sứ quán hoặc lãnh sự quán tại địa phương, nhà cung cấp dịch vụ bảo hiểm du lịch, công ty tổ chức tour, tổ chức cứu trợ và tín ngưỡng cũng như chủ lao động của người quá cố. Có thể sẽ cần có các văn bản chính thức cũng như nhận dạng chính thức về thi thể do văn phòng lãnh sự cấp.
Các yêu cầu của CDC đối với việc đưa hồi hương thi hài tùy thuộc vào việc liệu thi thể đó đã được ướp, hỏa táng hay chưa và liệu người đó có tử vong vì một căn bệnh truyền nhiễm phải kiểm dịch.
Vào thời điểm hiện tại, COVID-19 là một căn bệnh truyền nhiễm phải kiểm dịch tại Hoa Kỳ và thi hài phải đáp ứng các tiêu chuẩn nhập cảnh có trong 42 Bộ Luật Quy Định của Liên Bang Phần 71.55 và có thể được thông quan, giải phóng và được phép nhập cảnh vào Hoa Kỳ chỉ theo một số các điều kiện sau:

Thi hài được hỏa táng; HOẶC
Thi hài được ướp xác đúng cách và đặt trong quan tài được hàn kín; HOẶC
Thi hài có giấy phép do Giám đốc CDC cấp. Giấy phép CDC (nếu có) phải đi kèm với thi hài trong suốt thời gian vận chuyển. 
Quý vị có thể xin giấy phép nhập cảnh cho thi hài người đã biết rõ hoặc nghi ngờ bị chết do một căn bệnh truyền nhiễm phải kiểm dịch tại Bộ phận Kiểm dịch và Di cư toàn cầu của CDC bằng cách gọi điện tới Trung Tâm Hoạt Động Khẩn Cấp của CDC theo số máy 770-488-7100 hoặc gửi email tới địa chỉ dgmqpolicyoffice@
cdc.gov.



Vui lòng xem Hướng dẫn của CDC để biết thêm thông tin."
CDC đang làm gì đối với COVID-19?,"CDC đang làm việc với các đối tác liên bang khác trong một nỗ lực ứng phó của toàn chính phủ. Đây là tình huống diễn tiến nhanh và mới phát sinh, CDC sẽ tiếp tục thông tin cập nhật khi có sẵn. CDC làm việc 24/7 để bảo vệ sức khỏe của người dân. Thông tin thêm về Ứng phó của CDC với COVID-19 có trên mạng."
Tôi có thể nhiễm COVID-19 từ thú cưng hoặc động vật khác hay không?,"Hiện tại, không có bằng chứng về việc động vật đồng hành, bao gồm thú cưng, có thể lây COVID-19 cho người hay không hay chúng có phải là nguồn lây nhiễm ở Mỹ hay không. Đến nay, CDC chưa nhận được bất kỳ báo cáo nào về việc thú cưng bị nhiễm COVID-19 tại Hoa Kỳ.
Thú cưng có các loại vi-rút corona khác có thể làm cho chúng mắc bệnh, như vi-rút corona trong chó và mèo. Những loại vi-rút corona khác này không thể lây nhiễm cho người và không liên quan đến đợt bùng phát COVID-19 hiện tại.
Tuy nhiên, vì động vật có thể truyền các bệnh khác cho người, nên quý vị luôn nên thực hành các thói quen lành mạnh với thú cưng và các động vật khác, chẳng hạn như rửa tay và giữ vệ sinh tốt. Để biết thêm thông tin về các lợi ích từ việc sở hữu thú cưng, như sống an toàn và khỏe mạnh cùng động vật kể cả thú cưng, gia súc và động vật hoang dã, hãy truy cập trang web Thú Nuôi Khỏe Mạnh, Con Người Mạnh Khỏe của CDC."
Tôi có cần đưa thú cưng của mình đi xét nghiệm COVID-19 không?,"Không. Tại thời điểm này, không nên xét nghiệm COVID-19 cho động vật."
Động vật có thể mang vi-rút gây COVID-19 trên da hoặc lông của chúng không?,"Tại thời điểm này, không có bằng chứng nào cho thấy vi-rút gây ra COVID-19 có thể lây sang người từ da hoặc lông của thú cưng.
Nói chuyện với bác sĩ thú y về những cách tốt nhất để chăm sóc thú cưng của quý vị."
Tôi có nên tránh tiếp xúc với vật nuôi hoặc động vật khác nếu tôi bị nhiễm bệnh COVID-19?,"Quý vị nên hạn chế tiếp xúc với vật nuôi và các động vật khác khi đang bị nhiễm bệnh COVID-19, giống như quý vị cần phải làm với những người khác xung quanh. Mặc dù chưa có báo cáo về việc thú cưng bị bệnh do mắc COVID-19 tại Hoa Kỳ, chúng tôi vẫn khuyến cáo rằng những người bị bệnh do mắc COVID-19 cần hạn chế tiếp xúc với động vật cho đến khi có nhiều thông tin hơn về loại vi-rút corona mới này. Khi có thể, hãy để một thành viên khác trong gia đình chăm sóc động vật của quý vị trong khi quý vị bị bệnh. Nếu quý vị bị nhiễm bệnh COVID-19, hãy tránh tiếp xúc với vật nuôi, kể cả việc vuốt ve, vỗ về, chia sẻ đồ ăn và để vật nuôi hôn hoặc liếm. Nếu quý vị phải chăm sóc thú cưng của mình hoặc ở gần động vật trong khi bị bệnh, hãy rửa tay trước và sau khi quý vị tương tác với thú cưng."
Thú cưng từ nơi trú ẩn có an toàn để nhận nuôi không?,"Không có lý do để nghĩ rằng bất kỳ động vật nào, kể cả thú cưng ở nơi trú ẩn, ở Hoa Kỳ có thể là nguồn COVID-19."
Đối với động vật hoặc sản phẩm động vật nhập khẩu thì sao?,"CDC không có bất kỳ bằng chứng nào cho thấy động vật hoặc sản phẩm động vật nhập khẩu có nguy cơ lây lan COVID-19 tại Hoa Kỳ. Đây là tình huống diễn tiến nhanh và thông tin sẽ được cập nhập ngay khi có sẵn. Trung Tâm Kiểm Soát và Phòng Ngừa Dịch Bệnh (CDC) Hoa Kỳ, Bộ Nông Nghiệp Hoa Kỳ (USDA) và Cơ quan Dịch vụ Động Vật Hoang Dã và Hải sản (FWS) Hoa Kỳ đóng vai trò riêng biệt nhưng bổ sung cho nhau trong việc điều phối hoạt động nhập khẩu động vật sống và các sản phẩm từ động vật vào Hoa Kỳ. CDC đưa ra quy định về động vật và các sản phẩm động vật gây ra mối đe dọa cho sức khỏe con người, USDA đưa ra quy địnhbiểu tượng bên ngoàibiểu tượng bên ngoài về động vật và các sản phẩm động vật gây ra mối đe dọa cho nông nghiệp; và FWS đưa ra quy địnhbiểu tượng bên ngoàibiểu tượng bên ngoài về nhập khẩu các loài có nguy cơ tuyệt chủng và động vật hoang dã có thể gây hại cho sức khỏe và hạnh phúc của con người, lợi ích của nông nghiệp, làm vườn hoặc lâm nghiệp, và sức khỏe và sự sống còn của tài nguyên thiên nhiên hoang dã."
Tôi có thể du lịch tới Hoa Kỳ cùng với chó hoặc nhập khẩu chó vào Hoa Kỳ trong thời gian bùng phát COVID-19 không?,"Vui lòng tham khảo Yêu cầu của CDC về việc đưa chó đến Hoa Kỳ. Các yêu cầu hiện tại về việc tiêm vắc-xin bệnh dại áp dụng đối với chó nhập khẩu từ Trung Quốc, quốc gia có nguy cơ cao về bệnh dại."
"Những biện pháp phòng ngừa nào cần được thực hiện đối với động vật gần đây đã được nhập khẩu từ bên ngoài Hoa Kỳ (ví dụ: nơi trú ẩn, giải cứu hoặc làm thú cưng cá nhân)?","Động vật nhập khẩu cần đáp ứng yêu cầu của CDC và USDAbiểu tượng bên ngoàibiểu tượng bên ngoài về việc nhập cảnh vào Hoa Kỳ. Tại thời điểm này, không có bằng chứng cho thấy động vật đồng hành, bao gồm cả thú cưng và động vật phục vụ, có thể lây lan COVID-19. Như bất kỳ động vật nào được đưa vào môi trường mới, động vật đã được nhập khẩu gần đây nên được quan sát hàng ngày để phát hiện các dấu hiệu bệnh. Nếu động vật bị ốm thì chúng cần được bác sĩ thú y thăm khám. Hãy gọi cho phòng khám thú y tại địa phương trước khi đưa động vật đến phòng khám và cho họ biết rằng động vật gần đây đã được nhập khẩu từ một quốc gia khác.
Đây là tình huống diễn tiến nhanh và thông tin sẽ được cập nhập ngay khi có sẵn."
ما هو فيروس كورونا؟,فيروسات كورونا هي فصيلة كبيرة من الفيروسات التي قد تسبب المرض للحيوان والإنسان.  ومن المعروف أن عدداً من فيروسات كورونا تسبب لدى البشر حالات عدوى الجهاز التنفسي التي تتراوح حدتها من نزلات البرد الشائعة إلى الأمراض الأشد وخامة مثل متلازمة الشرق الأوسطالتنفسية والمتلازمة التنفسية الحادة الوخيمة (السارس). ويسبب فيروس كورونا المُكتشف مؤخراً مرض فيروس كورونا كوفيد-19.
ما هو مرض كوفيد-19؟,مرض كوفيد-19 هو مرض معد يسببه فيروس كورونا المُكتشف مؤخراً. ولم يكن هناك أي علم بوجود هذا الفيروس وهذا المرض المستجدين قبل اندلاع الفاشية في مدينة يوهان الصينية في كانون الأول/ ديسمبر 2019.
ما هي أعراض مرض كوفيد-19؟,تتمثل الأعراض الأكثر شيوعاً لمرض كوفيد-19 في الحمى والإرهاق والسعال الجاف. وقد يعاني بعض المرضى من الآلام والأوجاع، أو احتقان الأنف، أو الرشح، أو ألم الحلق، أو الإسهال. وعادة ما تكون هذه الأعراض خفيفة وتبدأ تدريجياً. ويصاب بعض الناس بالعدوى دون أن تظهرعليهم أي أعراض ودون أن يشعروا بالمرض. ويتعافى معظم الأشخاص (نحو 80%) من المرض دون الحاجة إلى علاج خاص. وتشتد حدة المرض لدى شخص واحد تقريباً من كل 6 أشخاص يصابون بعدوى كوفيد-19 حيث يعانون من صعوبة التنفس. وتزداد احتمالات إصابة المسنين والأشخاص المصابينبمشكلات طبية أساسية مثل ارتفاع ضغط الدم أو أمراض القلب أو داء السكري، بأمراض وخيمة. وقد توفى نحو 2% من الأشخاص الذين أُصيبوا بالمرض. وينبغي للأشخاص الذين يعانون من الحمى والسعال وصعوبة التنفس التماس الرعاية الطبية.
كيف ينتشر مرض كوفيد-19؟,يمكن أن يصاب الأشخاص بعدوى مرض كوفيد-19 عن طريق الأشخاص الآخرين المصابين بالفيروس. ويمكن للمرض أن ينتقل من شخص إلى شخص عن طريق القُطيرات الصغيرة التي تتناثر من الأنف أو الفم عندما يسعل الشخص المصاب بمرض كوفيد-19 أو يعطس. وتتساقط هذه القُطيرات على الأشياءوالأسطح المحيطة بالشخص. ويمكن حينها أن يصاب الأشخاص الآخرون بمرض كوفيد-19 عند ملامستهم لهذه الأشياء أو الأسطح ثم لمس عينيهم أو أنفهم أو فمهم. كما يمكن أن يصاب الأشخاص بمرض كوفيد-19 إذا تنفسوا القُطيرات التي تخرج من الشخص المصاب بالمرض مع سعاله أوزفيره. ولذا فمن الأهمية بمكان الابتعاد عن الشخص المريض بمسافة تزيد على متر واحد (3 أقدام). وتعكف المنظمة على تقييم البحوث الجارية بشأن طرق انتشار مرض كوفيد-19 وستواصل نشر أحدث ما تتوصل إليه من نتائج.
هل يمكن للفيروس المسبب لمرض كوفيد-19 أن ينتقل عبر الهواء؟,"تشير الدراسات التي أُجريت حتى يومنا هذا إلى أن الفيروس الذي يسبب مرض كوفيد-19 ينتقل في المقام الأول عن طريق ملامسة القُطيرات التنفسية لا عن طريق الهواء. انظر الإجابة عن السؤال السابق: ""كيف ينتشر مرض كوفيد-19؟"""
هل يمكن أن يصاب المرء بالمرض عن طريق شخص عديم الأعراض؟,تتمثل الطريقة الرئيسية لانتقال المرض في القُطيرات التنفسية التي يفرزها الشخص عند السعال. وتتضاءل احتمالات الإصابة بمرض كوفيد-19 عن طريق شخص عديم الأعراض بالمرة. ولكن العديد من الأشخاص المصابين بالمرض لا يعانون إلا من أعراض طفيفة. وينطبق ذلك بصفة خاصةعلى المراحل المبكرة للمرض. ولذا فمن الممكن الإصابة بمرض كوفيد-19 عن طريق شخص يعاني مثلاً من سعال خفيف ولا يشعر بالمرض. وتعكف المنظمة على تقييم البحوث الجارية بشأن فترة انتقال مرض كوفيد-19 وستواصل نشر أحدث النتائج.
هل يمكن أن أصاب بمرض كوفيد-19 عن طريق براز شخص مصاب بالمرض؟,تبدو مخاطر انتقال مرض كوفيد-19 عن طريق براز الشخص المصاب بالعدوى محدودة. وفي حين أن التحريات المبدئية تشير إلى أن الفيروس قد يتواجد في البراز في بعض الحالات، فإن انتشاره عبر هذا المسار لا يشكل إحدى السمات الرئيسية للفاشية. وتعكف المنظمة على تقييم البحوثالجارية بشأن طرق انتشار مرض كوفيد-19 وستواصل نشر النتائج الجديدة. ولكن نظراً إلى ما ينطوي عليه ذلك من مخاطر، فإنه يعد سبباً آخر لتنظيف اليدين بانتظام بعد استخدام دورة المياه وقبل تناول الطعام.
كيف يمكنني حماية نفسي ومنع انتشار المرض؟,تدابير الحماية للجميع. اطّلع باستمرار على آخر المعلومات عن فاشية مرض كوفيد-19 التي تُتاح على موقع المنظمة الإلكتروني والتي تصدرها سلطة الصحة العمومية الوطنية والمحلية في بلدك. لقد سجّلت بلدان كثيرة في العالم حالات إصابة بمرض كوفيد-19، وشهد العديد منها فاشيات. ولقد نجحت السلطات المعنية في الصين وفي بعض البلدان الأخرى في إبطاء وتيرة انتشار فاشياتها أو وقفها تماما. ونظرا لأنه من الصعب التنبؤ بتطور الوضع، يرجى الاطلاع بانتظام على آخر الأخبار. يمكنك الحد من احتمال إصابتك بمرض كوفيد-19 أو من انتشاره باتخاذ بعض الاحتياطات البسيطة: نظف يديك جيداً بانتظام بفركهما مطهر كحولي لليدين أو بغسلهما بالماء والصابون.لماذا؟ إن تنظيف يديك بالماء والصابون أو فركهما بمطهر كحولي من شأنه أن يقتل الفيروسات التي قد تكون على يديك.احتفظ بمسافة لا تقل عن متر واحد (3 أقدام) بينك وبين أي شخص يسعل أو يعطس.لماذا؟ عندما يسعل الشخص أو يعطس، تتناثر من أنفه أو فمه قُطيرات سائلة صغيرة قد تحتوي على الفيروس. فإذا كنت شديد الاقتراب منه يمكن أن تتنفس هذه القُطيرات، بما في ذلك الفيروس المسبب لمرض كوفيد-19 إذا كان الشخص مصاباً به.تجنب لمس عينيك وأنفك وفمك. لماذا؟ تلمس اليدين العديد من الأسطح ويمكنها أن تلتقط الفيروسات. وإذا تلوثت اليدان فإنهما قد تنقلان الفيروس إلى العينين أو الأنف أو الفم. ويمكن للفيروس أن يدخل الجسم عن طريق هذه المنافذ ويصيبك بالمرض. تأكد من اتّباعك أنت والمحيطين بك لممارسات النظافة التنفسية الجيدة. ويعني ذلك أن تغطي فمك وأنفك بكوعك المثني أو بمنديل ورقي عند السعال أو العطس، ثم التخلص من المنديل المستعمل على الفور. لماذا؟ إن القُطيرات تنشر الفيروس. وباتّباع ممارسات النظافة التنفسية الجيدة تحمي الأشخاص من حولك من الفيروسات مثل فيروسات البرد والأنفلونزا وكوفيد-19. إلزم المنزل إذا شعرت بالمرض. إذا كنت مصاباً بالحمى والسعال وصعوبة التنفس، التمس الرعاية الطبية واتصل بمقدم الرعاية قبل التوجه إليه. واتّبع توجيهات السلطات الصحية المحلية. لماذا؟ تتوفر للسلطات الوطنية والمحلية أحدث المعلومات عن الوضع في منطقتك. واتصالك المسبق بمقدم الرعاية الصحية سيسمح له بتوجيهك سريعاً إلى مرفق الرعاية الصحية المناسب. وسيسهم ذلك في حمايتك ومنع انتشار الفيروسات وسائر أنواع العدوى. اطلع باستمرار على آخر تطورات مرض كوفيد-19. واتّبع المشورة التي يسديها مقدم الرعاية الصحية أو سلطات الصحة العمومية الوطنية والمحلية أو صاحب العمل بشأن كيفية حماية نفسك والآخرين من مرض كوفيد-19. لماذا؟ تتوفر للسلطات الوطنية والمحلية أحدث المعلومات عما إذا كان مرض كوفيد-19 ينتشر في منطقتك. فهي الأقدر على إسداء المشورة بشأن الإجراءات التي يمكن أن يتخذها الأشخاص في منطقتك لحماية أنفسهم. اطّلع باستمرار على آخر المعلومات عن بؤر تفشي عدوى كوفيد-19 (المدن أو المناطق المحلية التي ينتشر فيها مرض كوفيد-19 على نطاق واسع). وتجنب السفر إلى هذه الأماكن قدر الإمكان، خصوصا إذا كنت مسنّاً أو مصابًا بداء السكري أو بأحد أمراض القلب أو الرئة.لماذا؟ لأن هناك احتمال أكبر أن تصاب بعدوى مرض كوفيد-19 في إحدى هذه المناطق. تدابير الحماية للأشخاص الذي يزورون مناطق ينتشر فيها مرض كوفيد-19 أو زاروها مؤخراً (الأيام الأربعة عشر الماضية) اتّبع الإرشادات الموضحة أعلاه (تدابير الحماية للجميع) في حال بدأت تشعر بالتوعك، ولو بأعراض خفيفة كالصداع والحمى المنخفضة الدرجة (37.3 درجة مئوية أو أكثر) ورشح خفيف في الأنف، اعزل نفسك بالبقاء في المنزل حتى تتعافى تماما. وإذا تطلّب الأمر الاستعانة بشخص ما لإحضار ما تحتاج إليه من لوازم أو كنت مضطرا إلى الخروج لشراء ما تأكله مثلا، فارتد قناعا لتجنب نقل العدوى إلى أشخاص آخرين. لماذا؟ سيسمح تجنبك لمخالطة الآخرين وزيارتك للمرافق الطبية بأن تعمل هذه المرافق بمزيد من الفعّالية، وسيساعدان على حمايتك أنت والآخرين من الفيروس المسبب لمرض كوفيد-19 وسائر الفيروسات. وإذا كنت تعاني من الحمى والسعال وصعوبة التنفس، التمس المشورة الطبية على الفور، فقد تكون مصاباً بعدوى الجهاز التنفسي أو حالة مرضية وخيمة أخرى. واتصل قبل الذهاب إلى مقدم الرعاية وأخبره إن كنت قد سافرت أو خالطت أي مسافرين مؤخراً. لماذا؟ إن اتصالك المسبق بمقدم الرعاية سيسمح له بتوجيهك سريعاً إلى مرفق الرعاية الصحية المناسب. وسيساعد ذلك أيضاً على منع أي انتشار محتمل للفيروس المسبب لمرض كوفيد-19 وغيره من الفيروسات.
ما هي احتمالات إصابتي بمرض كوفيد-19,يتوقف الخطر على المكان الذي تتواجد فيه، وبشكل أكثر تحديدًا، ما إذا كانت عدوى كوفيد-19 تتفشي في هذا المكان. وبالنسبة لمعظم الناس في معظم الأماكن، لا يزال خطر الإصابة بعدوى مرض كوفيد-19 ضعيفا. ومع ذلك، هناك بعض الأماكن في العالم (مدن أو مناطق) التي ينتشر فيها المرض حاليا. ويكون خطر الإصابة بعدوى مرض كوفيد-19 أعلى لدى الأشخاص الذين يعيشون في هذه المناطق أو يزورونها. وتتخذ الحكومات والسلطات الصحية حاليا إجراءات صارمة كلما كُشف عن حالة إصابة جديدة بمرض كوفيد-19. لذا، تأكّد من التزامك بأي قيود تُفرض محليا على السفر أو التنقل أو التجمعات الكبيرة. فالتعاون مع الجهات المعنية بمكافحة الأمراض من شأنه أن يحدّ من خطر الإصابة بمرض كوفيد-19 وانتشاره. ويمكن احتواء فاشيات مرض كوفيد-19 ووقف انتقال العدوى، كما تجلّى ذلك في الصين وفي بلدان أخرى. ولكن، لسوء الحظ، يمكن أن تظهر فاشيات جديدة بسرعة. لذا، من المهم أن تطّلع على الوضع في المكان الذي تتواجد فيه أو تنوي الذهاب إليه. وتنشر المنظمة يوميا أحدث المعلومات عن وضع عدوى كوفيد-19 في العالم. ويمكنك الاطلاع عليها من خلال الرابط التالي: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/
هل ينبغي أن أشعر بالقلق من الإصابة بمرض كوفيد-19؟,إن المرض الذي تسببه العدوى بفيروس كورونا المستجد (كوفيد-19) خفيف بشكل عام، لاسيما عند الأطفال والشباب. ومع ذلك، فإنه يمكن أن يسبب مرضًا خطيرًا، إذ يحتاج نحو شخص واحد من كل 5 أشخاص مصابين بهذا المرض إلى تلقّي الرعاية في المستشفى. لذا، فإن من الطبيعي أن يشعر الناس بالقلق إزاء كيفية تأثير فاشية مرض كوفيد-19 عليهم وعلى أحبائهم. ويمكننا توجيه قلقنا على النحو الصحيح بتحويله إلى إجراءات لحماية أنفسنا وأحبائنا ومجتمعاتنا المحلية. وعلى رأس هذه الإجراءات غسل اليدين بشكل منتظم ومسهب واتّباع ممارسات النظافة التنفسية الجيدة. ثانيا، الاطلاع على مشورة السلطات الصحية المحلية والتقيّد بها، بما في ذلك القيود التي قد تُفرض على السفر والتنقل والتجمعات. ويمكنك الحصول على مزيد من المعلومات عن كيفية حماية نفسك من خلال الرابط التالي: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public.
من هم الأشخاص المعرضون لخطر الإصابة بمرض وخيم؟,مازلنا نتعرف على تأثير مرض كوفيد-19 على الناس، ومع ذلك فيبدو أن المسنين والأشخاص المصابين بحالات طبية موجودة مسبقاً (مثل ارتفاع ضغط الدم وأمراض القلب وداء السكري) يصابون بمرض وخيم أكثر من غيرهم.
هل المضادات الحيوية فعّالة في الوقاية من مرض كوفيد-2019 أو علاجه؟,لا. لا تقضي المضادات الحيوية على الفيروسات، فهي لا تقضي إلا على العدوى الجرثومية. وبما أن مرض كوفيد-19 سببه فيروس، فإن المضادات الحيوية لا تقضي عليه. فلا ينبغي استعمال المضادات الحيوية كوسيلة للوقاية من مرض كوفيد-19 أو علاجه. ولا ينبغي استعمالها إلا وفقاًلتعليمات الطبيب لعلاج حالات العدوى الجرثومية.
هل توجد أي أدوية أو علاجات يمكنها الوقاية من مرض كوفيد-19 أو علاجه؟,في حين قد تريح بعض الأدوية الغربية أو التقليدية أو المنزلية من بعض أعراض كوفيد-19 أو تخففها، فليست هناك بيّنة على وجود أدوية حالياً من شأنها الوقاية من هذا المرض أو علاجه. ولا توصي المنظمة بالتطبيب الذاتي بواسطة أي أدوية، بما في ذلك المضادات الحيوية، سواء على سبيل الوقاية من مرض كوفيد-19 أو معالجته. غير أن هناك عدة تجارب سريرية جارية تتضمن أدوية غربية وتقليدية معاً. وستواصل المنظمة إتاحة معلومات محدّثة بهذا الشأن عندما تتوفر النتائج السريرية.
هل هناك لقاح أو دواء أو علاج لمرض كوفيد-2019؟, ليس بعد. لا يوجد حتى يومنا هذا لقاح ولا دواء محدد مضاد للفيروسات للوقاية من مرض كوفيد-2019 أو علاجه. ومع ذلك، فينبغي أن يتلقى المصابون به الرعاية لتخفيف الأعراض. وينبغي إدخال الأشخاص المصابين بمرض وخيم إلى المستشفيات. ويتعافى معظم المرضى بفضل الرعايةالداعمة. ويجري حالياً تحري بعض اللقاحات المحتملة والأدوية الخاصة بعلاج هذا المرض تحديداً. ويجري اختبارها عن طريق التجارب السريرية. وتقوم المنظمة بتنسيق الجهود المبذولة لتطوير اللقاحات والأدوية للوقاية من مرض كوفيد-19 وعلاجه. وتتمثل السبل الأكثر فعّالية لحماية نفسك والآخرين من مرض كوفيد-19 في المواظبة على تنظيف اليدين، وتغطية الفم عند السعال بثني المرفق أو بمنديل ورقي، والابتعاد مسافة لا تقل عن متر واحد (3 أقدام) عن الأشخاص الذين يسعلون أو يعطسون. (انظر: كيف يمكنني حماية نفسيومنع انتشار المرض؟).
هل مرض كوفيد-19 هو نفسه مرض سارس؟,لا. هناك ارتباط جيني بين الفيروس المسبب لمرض كوفيد-19 والفيروس المسبب للمتلازمة التنفسية الحادة الوخيمة (سارس)، ولكنهما مختلفان. ويعد مرض السارس أكثر فتكا من مرض كوفيد-19 ولكنه أقل عدوى منه بكثير. ولم يشهد أي مكان في العالم فاشية السارس منذ عام 2003.
,هل ينبغي أن أضع كمامة لحماية نفسي؟ لا تضع كمامة إلا إذا ظهرت عليك أعراض مرض كوفيد-19 (خاصة السعال) أو إذا كنت تقدم الرعاية لشخص يُحتمل أنه مصاب بهذا الـمرض. ولا يمكنك استعمال الكمامة وحيدة الاستعمال إلا مرة واحدة. أما إذا لم تكن مريضا أو إذا قائما على رعاية شخص مريض، فستكون قد أهدرت كمامة دون داع. ونظرا للنقص في إمدادات الكمامات على الصعيد العالمي، فإن المنظمة تحث الناس على التحلي بالحكمة في استخدامها. وتنصح المنظمة باستخدام الكمامات استخداما رشيدا لتفادي إهدار الموارد الثمينة دون داع وإساءة استخدامها (انظر الإرشادات بشأن استخدام الكمامات). وتتمثل السبل الأكثر فعّالية لحماية نفسك والآخرين من مرض كوفيد-19 في تنظيف يديك بشكل متكرر وتغطية الفم عند السعال بثني المرفق أو بمنديل ورقي، وترك مسافة لا تقل عن متر واحد (3 أقدام) عن الأشخاص الذين يسعلون أو يعطسون. ولمزيد من المعلومات، انظر تدابير الحماية الأساسية من فيروس كورونا المستجد. وتنصح المنظمة بالاستخدام الرشيد للكمامات الطبية لتلافي إهدار الموارد الثمينة وإساءة استخدام الأقنعة (انظر النصائح الخاصة باستخدام الكمامات). لا تستخدم الكمامة إلا إذا كنت مصاباً بأعراض تنفسية (السعال والعطس)، أو يُشتبه بإصابتك بعدوى مرض كوفيد-19 المصحوبةبأعراض خفيفة، أو كنت تقدم الرعاية إلى شخص يشتبه بإصابته بهذه العدوى. وترتبط العدوى المشتبه فيها بمرض كوفيد-19 بالسفر إلى المناطق التي أبلغت عن وجود حالات، أو بالمخالطة الوثيقة لشخص سافر إلى تلك المناطق وأُصيب بالمرض. وتتمثل السبل الأكثر فعّالية لحماية نفسك والآخرين من مرض كوفيد-19 في المواظبة على تنظيف اليدين، وتغطية الفم عند السعال بثني المرفق أو بمنديل ورقي، والابتعاد مسافة لا تقل عن متر واحد (3 أقدام) عن الأشخاص الذين يسعلون أو يعطسون. انظر تدابير الحماية للاطلاع على المزيد من المعلومات.
طريقة وضع الكمامة واستخدامها ونزعها والتخلص منها,1-       تذكر أن استخدام الكمامة ينبغي أن يقتصر على العاملين الصحيين ومقدمي الرعاية والأشخاص المصابين بأعراض تنفسية مثل الحمى والسعال. 2-       قبل لمس الكمامة، نظف يديك بفركهما بمطهر كحولي أو بغسلهما بالماء والصابون. 3-      أمسك الكمامة وافحصها للتأكد من أنها غير ممزقة أو مثقوبة. 4-      حدد الطرف العلوي من الكمامة (موضع الشريط المعدني). 5-      تأكد من توجيه الجانب الصحيح من الكمامة إلى الخارج (الجهة الملونة). 6-      ضع الكمامة على وجهك. اضغط على الشريط المعدني أو الطرف المقوى للكمامة ليتخذ شكل أنفك. 7-      اسحب الجزء السفلي من الكمامة لتغطي فمك وذقنك. 8-      بعد الاستخدام، اخلع الكمامة بنزع الشريط المطاطي من خلف الأذنين مبعداً الكمامة  عن وجهك وملابسك لتجنب ملامسة أجزاء الكمامة التي يحتمل أن تكون ملوثة. 9-      تخلص من الكمامة المستعملة على الفور برميها في صندوق نفايات مغلق. 10-  نظف يديك بعد ملامسة الكمامة أو رميها بفركهما بمطهر كحولي، أو إذا بغسلهما بالماء والصابون إذا كانت متسختين بوضوح.
كم تستغرق فترة حضانة مرض كوفيد-19؟,"مصطلح ""فترة الحضانة"" يشير إلى المدة من الإصابة بالفيروس إلى بدء ظهور أعراض المرض. وتتراوح معظم تقديرات فترة حضانة مرض كوفيد-19 ما بين يوم واحد و14 يوماً، وعادة ما تستمر خمسة أيام. وستُحدّث هذه التقديرات كلما توفر المزيد من البيانات."
هل يمكن أن تنتقل عدوى مرض كوفيد-19 إلى البشر من مصدر حيواني؟,فيروسات كورونا هي فصيلة كبيرة من الفيروسات الشائعة بين الخفافيش والحيوانات. ويصاب الأشخاص في حالات نادرة بعدوى هذه الفيروسات التي ينقلونها بعد ذلك إلى الآخرين. ومن الأمثلة على ذلك أن فيروس كورونا المسبب لمتلازمة الالتهاب الرئوي الحاد الوخيم (سارس)الذي ارتبط بقطط الزباد، وفيروس كورونا المسبب لمتلازمة الشرق الأوسط التنفسية الذي انتقل طريق الإبل. ولم تتأكد بعد المصادر الحيوانية المحتملة لمرض كوفيد-19. ولحماية نفسك، عندما تزور أسواق الحيوانات الحية مثلاً، تجنب الملامسة المباشرة للحيوانات وللأسطح الملامسة للحيوانات. وتأكد من اتّباع ممارسات السلامة الغذائية الجيدة في جميع الأوقات بتوخى العناية الواجبة عند التعامل مع اللحوم النيئة والحليب الخام وأعضاءالحيوانات لتلافي تلوث الأغذية غير المطهوة، وتجنب تناول المنتجات الحيوانية النيئة أو غير المطبوخة جيداً.
هل يمكن أن أُصاب بمرض كوفيد-19 عن طريق حيواني الأليف؟,على الرغم من تسجيل حالة إصابة كلب بعدوى كوفيد-19 في هونغ كونغ، فلا يوجد حتى اليوم دليل علمي على إمكانية انتقال عدوى كوفيد-19 من كلب أو قط أو أي حيوان أليف. فمرض كوفيد-19 ينتشر بشكل أساسي عن طريق القطيرات التي يفرزها الشخص المصاب بالعدوى عندما يسعل أو يعطس أو يتكلم. ولحماية نفسك من العدوى، نظف يديك بشكل جيد ومتكرر. وتواصل منظمة الصحة العالمية رصد آخر الأبحاث في هذا المجال وغيره من المواضيع المتصلة بكوفيد-19 وتحرص على تحديث هذه المعلومات كلما توفرت استنتاجات جديدة في هذا الصدد.
كم من الوقت يظل الفيروس حياً على الأسطح؟,لا يُعرف على وجه اليقين فترة استمرار الفيروس المسبب لمرض كوفيد-19 حياً على الأسطح، ولكن يبدو أنه يشبه في ذلك سائر فيروسات كورونا. وتشير الدراسات إلى أن فيروسات كورونا (بما في ذلك المعلومات الأولية عن الفيروس المسبب لمرض كوفيد-19) قد تظل حية على الأسطحلبضع ساعات أو لعدة أيام. وقد يختلف ذلك باختلاف الظروف (مثل نوع السطح ودرجة الحرارة أو الرطوبة البيئية). إذا كنت تعتقد أن سطحاً ما قد يكون ملوثاً، نظفه بمطهر عادي لقتل الفيروس وحماية نفسك والآخرين. ونظف يديك بفركهما بمطهر كحولي أو بغسلهما بالماء والصابون. وتجنب لمس عينيك أو فمك أو أنفك.
هل من الآمن تلقي الطرود من المناطق التي أبلغت عن حالات إصابة بمرض كوفيد-19؟,نعم. إن احتمالات تلوث السلع التجارية عن طريق شخص مصاب بالعدوى هي احتمالات ضعيفة، كما أن مخاطر الإصابة بالفيروس الذي يسبب مرض كوفيد-19 عن طريق طرد نُقل وشُحن وتعرض لمختلف الظروف ودرجات الحرارة، هي مخاطر ضئيلة.
هل هناك أمور ينبغي أن أتجنبها؟,التدابير التالية غير فعّالة في مواجهة مرض كوفيد-19 بل قد تكون ضارة: التدخيناستخدام كمامات متعددة تعاطي المضادات الحيوية (أنظر هل توجد أي أدوية أو علاجات يمكنها الوقاية من مرض كوفيد-19 أو علاجه؟) في جميع الأحوال، إذا كنت مصاباً بالحمى والسعال وصعوبة التنفس، التمس الرعاية الطبية مبكراً من أجل الحد من مخاطر الإصابة بعدوى أشد وطأة، وتأكد من إطلاع مقدم الرعاية الصحية على أي أماكن سافرت إليها في الآونة الأخيرة.
هل لفيروس كورونا المسبب لمرض كوفيد-19 مصدر معروف؟,حالياً، لا يزال مصدر فيروس كورونا-سارس-2، وهو فيروس كورونا المسبب لمرض كوفيد-19، غير معروف. غير أن جميع البيّنات المتاحة تشير إلى أن منشأ هذا الفيروس حيواني طبيعي وأنه ليس فيروساً مصنّعاً. والأرجح أن المستودع البيئي لفيروس كورونا-سارس-2 هو الخفافيش. وينحدر فيروس كورونا-سارس-2 من مجموعة فيروسات متقاربة جينياً تشمل فيروس كورونا لمسبب لمتلازمة سارس وعدد من فيروسات كورونا الأخرى المعزولة من أسراب الخفافيش. وينحدر فيروس كورونا المسبب لمتلازمة ميرس أيضاً من هذه الفصيلة، ولكن خصائصه تختلف عنها بعض الشيء.
كيف حدثت أول عدوى بشرية بفيروس كورونا-سارس-2؟,اكتُشفت أول حالات عدوى بشرية بمرض كوفيد-19 في مدينة ووهان الصينية في كانون الأول/ديسمبر 2019. ولا يمكن في هذه المرحلة تحديد كيف انتقلت عدوى الفيروس لأول مرة إلى البشر في ووهان. غير أن فيروس كورونا-سارس، الذي كان السبب في تفشي متلازمة سارس في عام 2003، طفر من مستودع حيواني (سنانير الزباد، وهو حيوان بري تتم تربيته في المزارع) إلى البشر ثم سرعان ما انتشر بينهم. وعلى نفس الشاكلة، يُعتقد أن فيروس كورونا-سارس-2 قد اخترق حاجز الأجناس وانتقلت عدواه إلى البشر عبر كائن مضيف وسيط على الأرجح، أي عن طريق نوع حيواني يتعامل معه البشر بشكل اعتيادي. وقد يكون حيواناً منزلياً أو حيواناً برياً أو حيواناً برياً مدجّناً، وهو ما لم يتسن تحديده حتى الآن. وإلى أن يتسنى تحديد مصدر هذا الفيروس والسيطرة عليه، فسيظل الخطر قائماً من عودة انتقاله إلى البشر واندلاع فاشيات جديدة كالتي نشهدها حالياً.
هل تنتقل عدوى كوفيد-19 بالهواء؟,ينتقل الفيروس المسبب لمرض كوفيد-19 بشكل أساسي عن طريق القطيرات المنبعثة من الشخص المصاب بالعدوى عندما يعطس أو يسعل أو يتكلم. ووزن هذه القطيرات أثقل من أن يسمح لها بالبقاء معلقة في الهواء، فهي سرعان ما تسقط على الأرض أو الأسطح. ويمكن أن تنتقل إليك عدوى الفيروس بالاستنشاق إذا كنت على مسافة متر واحد من شخص مصاب بمرض كوفيد-19 أو إذا لامست سطحاً ملوثاً ثم لمست عينيك أو أنفك أو فمك قبل أن تغسل يديك. روابط ذات الصلة. الموقع الإلكتروني الخاص بمرض كوفيد-19. نصائح المنظمة الخاصة بالسفر.
هل توصي المنظمة بإلغاء جميع التجمعات الدولية الحاشدة بسبب مرض كوفيد-19؟,لا. نظراً إلى أن كل تجمع دولي حاشد يختلف عن الآخر، فإن العوامل التي ينبغي النظر فيها عند تحديد إذا ما كان ينبغي إلغاء هذا الحدث أم لا، قد تختلف أيضاً. وينبغي أن يستند أي قرار بشأن تغيير التجمع الدولي المخطط له إلى تقدير دقيق للمخاطر ولطريقة إدارتها ولمستوى التخطيط للحدث. وينبغي أن يشارك في هذا التقدير جميع الجهات صاحبة المصلحة في الحدث، ولاسيما السلطات الصحية في البلد أو المجتمع المحلي الذي يُقام فيه الحدث. وتحتل هذه السلطات والجهات صاحبة المصلحة مكانة تؤهلها تماماً من تقدير مستوى الضغوط التي قد يضعها الحدث على النظام الصحي المحلي وخدمات الطوارئ - وما إذا كان مستوى هذه الضغوط يُعد مقبولاً في الحالة الراهنة.
ما هي العوامل التي ينبغي لمنظمي الحدث والسلطات الصحية النظر فيها عند تحديد إذا كانت المخاطر مقبولة أم لا؟,"بالنسبة إلى البلدان التي لا يُعرف حالياً أنها تشهد الانتقال المجتمعي لمرض كوفيد-19، سيتمثل الاعتبار الأول الذي ينبغي مراعاته فيما إذا كان التجمع الحاشد المقرر إقامته يزيد بقدر كبير من مخاطر دخول الفيروس إلى البلاد وترسخه فيها، ومخاطر حمل المشاركين للعدوى إلى أوطانهم وزيادة انتشار المرض على الصعيد العالمي. وعند إجراء هذا التقدير، ينبغي لمنظمي الحدث والسلطات الصحية الوطنية أو المحلية الإقرار بأن مخاطر الحالات الوافدة لمرض كوفيد-19 ترتبط بطبيعة الحال بالسفر الدولي. كما ينبغي لهم الإقرار بأن استهداف انعدام المخاطر غير واقعي وغير محبذ. وعند اتخاذ منظمي الحدث والسلطات الصحية لقرار بشأن إقامة التجمع الحاشد أم لا، ينبغي لهم تحديد ما هي المخاطر المقبولة وما هي التدابير الإضافية التي ينبغي اتخاذها لتخفيف حدة المخاطر. وبالنسبة إلى البلدان التي بدأ فيها انتشار مرض كوفيد في المجتمع المحلي، ينبغي أن تتمثل الاعتبارات الرئيسية التي تنبغي مراعاتها، فيما يلي:استهداف احتواء انتشار الفيروس في المجتمع المحلي/ البلاد أو إبطائه على الأقل.وقاية المشاركين من البلدان الأخرى من العدوى بمرض كوفيد-19.  وينبغي في جميع الحالات النظر في المخاطر القائمة في سياق خصائص مرض كوفيد-19 المعروفة، ومدى وخامته ومدى سريانه ومدى فعّالية تدابير الوقاية من المرض أو الحد من انتقاله. كما يلزم مراعاة الضغوط التي تتعرض لها النُظم الصحية المحلية بالفعل نتيجة للاستجابة لفاشية(فاشيات) مرض كوفيد-19، والضغوط الإضافية التي قد يضعها التجمع الحاشد على هذه النُظم.ويمكنك الاطلاع على المزيد من المشورة بشأن الاعتبارات التي ينبغي مراعاتها في الوثيقة الصادرة عن المنظمة في 14 شباط/ فبراير 2020، تحت عنوان "" التوصيات الرئيسية بشأن التخطيط للتجمعات الحاشدة في سياق فاشية مرض كوفيد-19 الحالية"". انظر الرابط التالي: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/key-planning-recommendations-for-mass-gatherings-in-the-context-of-the-current-covid-19-outbreak"
ماذا لو كانت المؤسسة التي أنتمي إليها لا تتمتع بالخبرة اللازمة لتقدير المخاطر التي يطرحها مرض كوفيد-19 على التجمع الحاشد الذي نخطط لإقامته؟,غالباً ما ستكون سلطات الصحة العمومية الوطنية والمحلية في البلد الذي تعتزمون إقامة التجمع الحاشد فيه، على علم بكيفية إجراء تقدير للمخاطر الصحية. وفي حال وجود مكتب قُطري لمنظمة الصحة العالمية، قد يكون في إمكانه إتاحة بعض الدعم الذي يقدمه الخبراء. كما أن مكتب المنظمة الإقليمي في الجزء من العالم الذي تعيش فيه في إمكانه أن يقوم بذلك أيضاً. يمكنك الاطلاع على أسماء مسؤولي الاتصال في المكاتب الإقليمية للمنظمة وبياناتهم على الرابط التالي: https://www.who.int/ar/about/who-we-are/regional-offices
إذا قررنا إقامة التجمع الدولي الحاشد، ما هي الإجراءات التي يمكن أن نتخذها للحد من مخاطر إصابة المشاركين بعدوى مرض كوفيد-19؟,الترويج لغسل اليدين والنظافة التنفسية والمباعدة الاجتماعية أثناء الحدث. والتأكد من حيازتك للبيانات اللازمة للاتصال بجميع المشاركين في حالات الطوارئ، بما في ذلك أماكن إقامتهم أثناء الحدث. وينبغي أن توضح لهم أن هذه المعلومات ستُرسل إلى سلطات الصحة العمومية المحلية لتمكينها من التتبع السريع لمخالطي المريض في حال إصابة أحد المشاركين في الحدث بمرض كوفيد-19. ويلزم على منظمي الحدث أن يضعوا خطة متفق عليها للتأهب في حال إصابة واحد أو أكثر من المشاركين بأعراض مرض كوفيد-19. وينبغي أن تشمل هذه الخطة العزل السريع للشخص المريض ونقله على نحو مأمون إلى مرفق محلي للرعاية الصحية. وينبغي أن تنظر في إمكانية الحد من عدد المشاركين في الحدث، وإتاحة المشاركة عبر الفيديو أو الاجتماع عن بعد، وإن أمكن فحص المشاركين لتحري أعراض مرض كوفيد-19 (السعال أو الحمى أو التوعك) في نقاط الدخول إلى الحدث. ويمكن الاطلاع على المشورة بشأن كيفية حماية فرادى المشاركين لأنفسهم ولأحبائهم من مرض كوفيد-19 على الرابط التالي: https://www.who.int/ar/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public
أين يمكنني أن أجد المزيد من المشورة بشأن تقدير المخاطر الصحية وإدارتها فيما يتعلق بالتجمعات الدولية الحاشدة؟,أصدرت المنظمة إرشادات ودورة تدريبية بشأن كيفية التخطيط للتجمعات الحاشدة. وتتناول الإرشادات والدورة التدريبية كلاهما كيفية إجراء تقدير المخاطر والتخطيط للمخاطر الصحية وإدارتها بمشاركة السلطات المحلية: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/points-of-entry-and-mass-gatherings   ويمكن الاطلاع على المشورة التي يمكن إسداؤها لفرادى المشاركين لحماية أنفسهم وأحبائهم من مرض كوفيد-19 على الرابط التالي: https://www.who.int/ar/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public
كيف يمكن غسل الشراشف والفوط والملابس المتسخة للمرضى المصابين بعدوى كوفيد -19؟,ينبغي لجميع الأفراد الذين يتعاملون مع شراشف وفوط وملابس المرضى المصابين بعدوى كوفيد-19 القيام بما يلي: أ)  ارتداء معدات الحماية الشخصية المناسبة، وتشمل: القفازات المتينة والكمامة وحماية العينين (واقي الوجه/النظارات الواقية) ورداء طبي بأكمام طويلة ومريلة (إذا لم الرداء مقاوماً للبلل) وأحذية طويلة أو مغلقة، قبل لمس أي أغطية وملابس متسخة. ب)  الحذر من حمل الملابس المتسخة قريباً من الجسم، ووضعها في حاوية مانعة للتسرب ومميزة بوضوح (كيس أو دلو مثلاً) ج)  إذا كان على الثياب المتسخة أي فضلات صلبة، مثل الغائط أو القيء، يتعين كشطها بحذر بواسطة أداة مسطحة صلبة ورميها في المرحاض/المكان المخصص لها قبل وضع الملابس المتسخة في الحاوية المخصصة. وإذا لم يكن المرحاض في غرفة المريض نفسه، فتوضع الفضلات في دلومغلق للتخلص منها في المرحاض. د)  غسل الأغطية والملابس المتسخة وتعقيمها: يوصى بتنظيف الملابس والأغطية المتسخة عن طريق غسلها في الغسالة بمسحوق الغسيل وماء دافئ (تتراوح درجة حرارته تتراوح بين 60 و90 درجة مئوية). وإذا لم تتوفر الغسالة، فيمكن نقع الملابس في الماء الحار والصابون فيحوض كبير واستخدام عصا لتحريكها بحذر لتجنب رذاذ الماء. وإذا لم يتوفر الماء الحار، فيمكن نقع الملابس في سائل الكلور المركز بنسبة 0.05 في المائة لمدة 30 دقيقة تقريباً. وأخيراً، تُشطف الملابس بالماء النظيف وتُترك لتجف تماماً تحت أشعة الشمس. ويمكن الاطلاع على موارد إضافية عن أفضل ممارسات التنظيف البيئي في الوثيقتين التاليتين: 1) الوقاية من العدوى ومكافحة الالتهابات التنفسية الحادة التي يسهل تحولها إلى أوبئة وجائحات في سياق الرعاية الصحية (بالإنكليزية): https://www.who.int/csr/bioriskreduction/infection_control/publication/en/ 2) أفضل ممارسات التنظيف البيئي في مرافق الرعاية الصحية في الأماكن المحدودة الموارد، التي أعدّها مركز مكافحة الأمراض والوقاية منها والمركز الوطني للأمراض الناشئة والأمراض المعدية الحيوانية المنشأ (بالإنكليزية): https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/resource-limited/environmental-cleaning-508.pdf.
ما هي التوصيات المتعلقة بتعقيم السيارات والسلع والمنتجات القادمة من الصين أو من بلدان أخرى متضررة بفاشية كوفيد-19؟,لا توجد حتى اليوم معلومات وبائية تشير إلى أن لمس السلع أو المنتجات أو السيارات المصدّرة من البلدان المتضررة بفاشية كوفيد-19 تشكل مصدراً لانتقال العدوى إلى البشر. ولهذه الأسباب، لا توجد توصيات بشأن تعقيم أي من السلع والمنتجات المجلوبة من البلدان المتضررة بفاشية كوفيد-19، إذ لا توجد أي أدلة على أن هذه المنتجات تشكّل خطراً على الصحة العامة. وستواصل المنظمة رصد تطور فاشية كوفيد-19 عن كثب وتحديث التوصيات حسب الحاجة. ما هي معدات الحماية الشخصية (PPE) التي ينبغي أن يستخدمها عاملو الرعاية الصحية الذين يجرون المسحات المخاطية الأنفية أو البلعومية للمرضى المصابين بعدوى كوفيد-19 مؤكدة أو مشتبه بها؟ ينبغي أن يتلقى عاملو الرعاية الصحية الذين يأخذون عيّنات ممسوحة أنفية أو بلعومية من المرضى المصابين بعدوى كوفيد-19 المؤكدة أو المشتبه فيها، تدريباً جيداً على هذا الإجراء الطبي وأن يرتدوا رداء نظيفاً طويل الأكمام غير معقم وكمامة طبية وحماية للعينين(واقي الوجه أو النظارات الواقية) وقفازات. وينبغي تنفيذ هذا الإجراء الطبي في غرفة منفصلة/معزولة، كما ينبغي أن يطلب عاملو الرعاية الصحية من المرضى تغطية فمهم بكمامة طبية أو منديل أثناء أخذ العينة. ورغم أن أخذ المسحات المخاطية الأنفية والبلعوميةينطوي على إمكانية حفز السعال عند المريض الخاضع للإجراء، فلا توجد حالياً بينة على أن السعال الناتج عن أخذ العينة يؤدي إلى تفاقم خطر انتقال فيروس مرض كوفيد-19 عبر الضبوب (الرذاذ).
هل ينبغي أن تجري مراكز التبرع بالدم فحوصاً روتينية للتأكد من خلو مشتقات الدم من فيروس مرض كوفيد-19؟,كلا. رغم اكشتاف شدفات من حمض الرنا لفيروس SARS-CoV-2   في دم المرضى المصابين بأعراض مرض كوفيد-19، فإن ذلك لا يعني أن الفيروس حي أو معدٍ. وبشكل عام، لم يُعرف أن الفيروسات التنفسية تنتقل بواسطة نقل الدم. وينبغي أن تطبق مراكز التبرع تدابيرالفحص الروتينية للمتبرعين بالدم لمنع الأفراد المصابين بأعراض تنفسية أو بالحمى من التبرع بدمهم. وكإجراء احتياطي، يمكن لهذه المراكز أن تشجع الأشخاص الذين سافروا إلى أحد البلدان المتضررة بفاشية كوفيد-19 خلال 14 يوماً الأخيرة أو الذين تم تشخيصإصابتهم بالمرض أو الذين خالطوا حالة تأكّدت إصابتها بالمرض، على الامتناع عن التبرع بدمهم.
هل تعتبر الأحذية الطويلة أو المرايل غير النفّاذة أو المعاطف التي تغطي كامل الجسم من معدات الوقاية الشخصية الضرورية للعاملين في مجال الرعاية الصحية الذين يقدمون الرعاية الروتينية إلى المرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بعدوى فيروس كورونا المستجد (2019-nCoV) أو الذين تأكّدت إصابتهم بها؟,لا. توصي إرشادات المنظمة الحالية المتعلقة بالعاملين في مجال الرعاية الصحية الذين يقدمون الرعاية إلى المرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بمرض تنفسي حاد ناجم عن فيروس كورونا المستجد (2019-nCoV) أو الذين تأكّدت إصابتهم به بتطبيق احتياطات الوقاية منالعدوى المنقولة بالملامسة والقطيرات، فضلا عن الاحتياطات النموذجية التي ينبغي لجميع العاملين في مجال الرعاية الصحية الالتزام بها دوما مع جميع المرضى. وفيما يخص معدات الوقاية الشخصية، تشمل احتياطات الوقاية من العدوى المنقولة بالملامسة والقطيراتارتداء قفازات وحيدة الاستعمال لحماية اليدين، ولباس نظيف غير معقم طويل الأكمام لمنع تلوث الملابس، وأقنعة طبية لحماية الأنف والفم، وواق للعينين (مثل النظارات الواقية وواقي الوجه) قبل الدخول إلى الغرفة حيث يوجد المرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهمبمرض تنفسي حاد ناجم عن فيروس كورونا المستجد (2019-nCoV) أو الذين تأكّدت إصابتهم به. وعلى سبيل المثال، فإن استعمال أجهزة التنفس (مثل جهاز N95)  ضروري عند تنفيذ الإجراءات المولّدة للضبوب فقط. ولمزيد من المعلومات عن معدات الوقاية الشخصيةالخاصة بالعاملين في مجال الرعاية الصحية الذين يقدمون الرعاية إلى المرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بفيروس كورونا المستجد (2019-nCoV) أو الذين تأكّدت إصابتهم به، يرجى النقر على الرابط التالي (بالإنكليزية): https://www.who.int/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control-during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected-20200125.
هل يمكن تعقيم وإعادة استعمال أقنعة الوجه الطبية الوحيدة الاستعمال؟,لا. إن أقنعة الوجه الطبية الوحيدة الاستعمال صُمّمت لتُستعمل مرة واحدة فقط. وبعد الانتهاء من استعمالها، ينبغي إزالتها باتباع التقنيات المناسبة (عدم لمس مقدمة القناع، وإزالة القناع بسحب الأشرطة المرنة أو الأربطة من الخلف مثلا) ورميه فورافي سلة للنفايات المعدية ذات غطاء، ثم تطبيق تدابير نظافة اليدين. ولمزيد من المعلومات عن استعمال الأقنعة في سياق فاشية فيروس كورونا المستجد، يرجى النقر على الرابط التالي (بالإنكليزية): https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-health-care-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak.
لماذا توصي منظمة الصحة العالمية بأن يطبق العاملون في مجال الرعاية الصحية الذين يقدمون الرعاية إلى المرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بعدوى فيروس كورونا المستجد أو الذين تأكّدت إصابتهم بها احتياطات الوقاية من العدوى المنقولة بالملامسة والقطيرات بدلا من تطبيق احتياطات الوقاية من العدوى المنقولة بالهواء بشكل روتيني؟,أعدّت منظمة الصحة العالمية إرشاداتها الأولية بناءً على توافق الآراء الذي توصل إليه الخبراء الدوليون الذين نظروا في البيّنات المتاحة حاليًا بشأن أنماط انتقال عدوى فيروس كورونا المستجد. وتثبت هذه البيّنات انتقال عدوى الفيروس بالقطيراتومن خلال ملامسة أسطح المعدات الملوثة، ولكنها لا تدعم الانتقال الروتيني للعدوى عن طريق الهواء. وقد يحدث انتقال للعدوى بالهواء أثناء تنفيذ الإجراءات المولّدة للضبوب (مثل التنبيب الرغامي وتنظير القصبات)، كما تَبيَّن من أمراض تنفسيةفيروسية أخرى، لذا فإن المنظمة توصي باتخاذ احتياطات الوقاية من العدوى المنقولة بالهواء أثناء القيام بهذه الإجراءات. ولمزيد من المعلومات عن حماية العاملين في مجال الرعاية الصحية من فيروس كورونا المستجد، يرجى النقر على الرابط التالي(بالإنكليزية): https://www.who.int/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control-during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected-20200125.
هل توصي المنظمة بارتداء الأشخاص الأصحاء أقنعة بشكل روتيني أثناء فاشية فيروس كورونا المستجد؟,لا. إن المنظمة لا توصي بأن يرتدي أفراد المجتمع المحلي الذين لا تظهر عليهم أعراض المرض (أي الذين ليس لديهم أي أعراض تنفسية) أقنعة طبية لأنه لا توجد حاليًا أي بيّنات على أن استعمال الأشخاص الأصحاء للأقنعة الطبية بشكل روتيني يمنعانتقال فيروس كورونا المستجد. وبالمقابل، يوصى أفراد المجتمع المحلي الذين تظهر عليهم أعراض المرض بأن يستعملوا الأقنعة الطبية. إن سوء استعمال الأقنعة الطبية والإفراط في استعمالها قد يؤديان إلى نقص حاد في مخزون الأقنعة، ومنثمّ حرمان الأشخاص الذين هم بأمس الحاجة إليها من ارتدائها. وفي مرافق الرعاية الصحية حيث يقدم العاملون في مجال الرعاية الصحية الرعاية إلى المرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بمرض تنفسي حاد ناجم عن فيروس كورونا المستجد (2019-nCoV) أو الذين تأكّدت إصابتهم به، تعد الأقنعة عنصرا هاما في الجهودالرامية إلى احتواء انتشار فيروس كورونا المستجد  بين الناس، إلى جانب معدات الوقاية الشخصية الأخرى وتدابير نظافة اليدين. ولمزيد من المعلومات عن استعمال القناع الطبي، يرجة الانقر على الرابط التالي (بالإنكليزية): https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-health-care-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak.
هل يمكن جمع المرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بعدوى فيروس كورونا المستجد أو الذين تأكّدت إصابتهم بها في نفس الغرفة؟,يُستحسن أن يُعزل المرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بمرض تنفسي حاد ناجم عن فيروس كورونا المستجد أو الذين تأكّدت إصابتهم به، في غرف فردية. ولكن، إذا تَعذّر ذلك (بسبب العدد المحدود للغرف الفردية مثلا)، فإن جمعهم في غرفة واحدةيعد خيارا مقبولا. وفي الواقع، قد يكون بعض المرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بعدوى فيروس كورونا المستجد مصابين بأمراض تنفسية أخرى، ومن ثم فإنه يجب فصلهم عن المرضى الذين تأكّدت إصابتهم بعدوى الفيروس. وينبغي أن تُتركمسافة لا تقل عن متر واحد بين كل سرير في جميع الأوقات.
هل يتعين إدخال المرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بعدوى فيروس كورونا المستجد أو الذين تأكّدت إصابتهم بها إلى المستشفى إذا كانوا يعانون من مرض خفيف؟,لا. بالنسبة للمرضى الذين يعانون من مرض خفيف، مثل الحمى المنخفضة الدرجة والسعال والوعكة والثرّ الأنفي والتهاب الحلق بدون علامات منذرة، مثل ضيق التنفس أو صعوبة في التنفس، وزيادة وتيرة التنفس (مثل البلغم أو نفث الدم)،وأعراض المعدة والأمعاء مثل الغثيان والقيء و/ أو الإسهال ودون حدوث تغييرات في الحالة النفسية، قد لا يتطلب الأمر إدخالهم إلى المستشفى إلا إذا كان هناك خطر في حدوث تدهور سريري سريع. كما أنه ينبغي دعوة جميع المرضى الذينغادروا المستشفى إلى العودة إليه في حال ما إذا تفاقم مرضهم. ولمزيد من المعلومات عن معايير القبول، يرجى النقر على الرابط التالي (بالإنكليزية): https://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected. لمزيد من المعلومات عن الرعاية المنزلية للمرضى المصابين بعدوى فيروس كورونا المستجد الذين تظهر عليهم أعراض خفيفة، يرجى النقر على الرابط التالي (بالإنكليزية): https://www.who.int/publications-detail/home-care-for-patients-with-suspected-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-presenting-with-mild-symptoms-and-management-of-contacts.
في حالة ما إذا اقتضى الأمر إدخال المرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بعدوى فيروس كورونا المستجد أو الذين تأكّدت إصابتهم بها إلى المستشفى، هل تعتبر المستشفيات المتخصصة أو مستشفيات الإحالة ضرورية؟,لا. إن توصيات منظمة الصحة العالمية الحالية لا تتضمن شرطا بالاستعانة حصريا بمستشفيات متخصصة أو مستشفيات إحالة لعلاج المرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بمرض تنفسي حاد ناجم عن فيروس كورونا المستجد أو الذين تأكّدت إصابتهمبه. ومع ذلك، يجوز للبلدان أو الولايات القضائية المحلية أن تختار مثل هذه المستشفيات إذا رأت أنها أكثر المستشفيات المحتملة قدرة على تقديم الرعاية المأمونة للمرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بعدوى فيروس كوروناالمستجد أو الذين تأكّدت إصابتهم بها، أو لأسباب سريرية أخرى (مثل توافر إجراءات الإنعاش الحيوي المتقدم). وعلى أي حال، ينبغي لأي مرفق من مرافق الرعاية الصحية التي تعالج المرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بعدوىفيروس كورونا المستجد أو الذين تأكّدت إصابتهم بها أن تلتزم بتوصيات منظمة الصحة العالمية للوقاية من العدوى ومكافحتها أثناء الرعاية الصحية من أجل حماية المرضى والموظفين والزوار. وللاطلاع على الإرشادات ذات الصلة،يرجى النقر على الرابط التالي (بالإنكليزية): https://www.who.int/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control-during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected-20200125.
ما هي المطهرات الموصى باستخدامها لتنظيف البيئة في مرافق الرعاية الصحية أو المنازل التي يوجد فيها المرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بعدوى فيروس كورونا المستجد أو الذين تأكّدت إصابتهم بها؟,لتنظيف البيئة في مرافق الرعاية الصحية أو المنازل التي يوجد فيها المرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بعدوى فيروس كورونا المستجد أو الذين تأكّدت إصابتهم بها، ينبغي أن تُستخدم المطهرات الفعالة ضد الفيروسات المغلفة،مثل فيروس كورونا المستجد وغيره من أنواع فيروسات كورونا. وهناك العديد من المطهرات، بما فيها تلك الشائعة الاستعمال في المستشفيات، والتي تعد فعالة ضد الفيروسات المغلفة. وتنص توصيات منظمة الصحة العالميةحاليًا على استخدام ما يلي: 70% من الكحول الإيثيلي لتطهير المعدات المخصصة القابلة للاستعمال المتكرر (مثل مقاييس الحرارة) عقب كل استخدامهيبوكلوريت الصوديوم بنسبة 0.5% (ما يعادل 5000 جزء في المليون) لتطهير الأسطح التي تُلمس بشكل متكرر في المنازل أو في مرافق الرعاية الصحية. وللاطلاع على الإرشادات المتعلقة بمرافق الرعاية الصحية أثناء فاشية فيروس كورونا المستجد، يرجى النقر على الرابطين التاليين(بالإنكليزية): https://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected  وhttps://www.who.int/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control-during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected-20200125. ويمكن الاطلاع على المزيد من المعلومات عن تنظيف البيئئة بالنقر على الرابط التالي: https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/resource-limited/environmental-cleaning-508.pdf.
ما مدة بقاء فيروس كورونا المستجد على سطح جاف؟,لا تتوفر حاليًا أي بيانات عن درجة ثبات فيروس كورونا المستجد على الأسطح. وقد أظهرت البيانات المستقاة من الدراسات المختبرية التي أجريت على فيروس كورونا المسبب للمتلازمة التنفسية الحادة الوخيمةوفيروس كورونا المسبب لمتلازمة الشرق الأوسط التنفسية أن درجة ثبات الفيروس في البيئة يتوقف على عدة عوامل، بما فيها درجة الحرارة النسبية والرطوبة ونوع السطح. وتواصل المنظمة رصد البيّناتالقائمة بشأن فيروس كورونا المستجد وستقدم أحدث المعلومات بمجرد توفر هذه البيّنات.
هل هناك إجراء خاص فيما يتعلق بالنفايات الناتجة عن المرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بعدوى فيروس كورونا المستجد أو الذين تأكّدت إصابتهم بها؟,لا. ينبغي التخلص من النفايات الناتجة عن الرعاية الصحية أو المنزلية للمرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بعدوى فيروس كورونا المستجد أو الذين تأكّدت إصابتهم بها باعتبارها نفايات معدية. ولمزيد منالمعلومات عن التخلص من النفايات المعدية، يرجى النقر على الرابطين التاليين (بالإنكليزية): https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/safe-management-of-waste-summary/en/ https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/resource-limited/environmental-cleaning-508.pdf.
هل هناك إجراءات خاصة للتصرف في جثث الأشخاص المتوفين نتيجة فيروس كورونا المستجد؟,لا، لا توجد هناك أي إجراءات خاصة للتصرف في جثث الأشخاص المتوفين نتيجة فيروس كورونا المستجد. وينبغي للسلطات والمرافق الطبية أن تطبق سياساتها ونظمها القائمة التي تنظّم التصرف في جثثالأشخاص المتوفين نتيجة أمراض معدية.
ما هي التوصيات الخاصة باستعمال الكلور لتنظيف اليدين وتعقيمها في سياق فيروس ‏كورونا المستجد؟,يمكن استعمال محلول الكلور المخفف (0.05 في المائة) لتعقيم اليدين عندما لا يتوفر ‏مطهر كحولي لليدين أو صابون. ولكن لا يوصى باستعمال محلول الكلور المخفف عندما ‏يتوفر المطهر الكحوليأو الصابون والماء لأنه ينطوي على مخاطر أكبر بالتسبب في ‏حساسية لليدين وأضرار صحية أخرى جراء تجهيز محاليل الكلور وتخفيفها. إضافة إلى ‏ذلك، يجب تجهيز محاليل الكلور يومياًوتخزينها في مكان جافٍ وبارد في عبوات مغلقة ‏بإحكام بعيداً عن ضوء الشمس، وإلا يمكن أن تفقد شيئاً من مفعولها ونجاعتها في التطهير. ‏غير أن الكلور معقم فعال لأغراض التنظيفالبيئتي (بمستوى تركيز 0.05 في المائة) إذا ‏استُعمل بعد التنظيف بالصابون والماء.   ‏

ما هو النشاط البدني؟,يشمل النشاط البدني جميع أشكال الترفيه النشط وممارسة الرياضة وركوب الدراجة والمشي، فضلا عن الأنشطة التي تمارسها خلال أداء عملك والأعمال المنزلية وخلال الاعتناء بحديقتك. ولا تعني الرياضة بالضرورة القيام بتمارين رياضية - فاللعب والرقص والبستنة وحتى تنظيف المنزل وحمل المشتريات الثقيلة تعتبر كلها نوعا من النشاط البدني.وخلال فاشية كوفيد-19، حيث العديد منا مقيّد الحركة، من المهم بمكان أن يظل جميع الناس بجميع فئات أعمارهم وقدراتهم نشطين قدر الإمكان. فأخذ فترة استراحة للوقوف والقيام، ولو لمدة 3 إلى 5 دقائق من النشاط البدني، مثل المشي أو تمارين التمدد، ستساعد على استرخاء العضلات المجهدة، وتخفيف التوتر العقلي وتحسين نشاط الدورة الدموية وتنشيط العضلات. ويمكن أن يساعد النشاط البدني المنتظم أيضًا على إضفاء شيء من الروتين على الأيام وأن يكون وسيلة للبقاء على اتصال مع الأهل والأصدقاء.
لماذا نحتاج إلى ممارسة النشاط البدني؟,النشاط البدني المنتظم مفيد للجسم والعقل على حد السواء. فمن شأنه خفض ضغط الدم المرتفع والمساعدة على التحكم في الوزن وتقليل خطر الإصابة بأمراض القلب والسكتة الدماغية والسكري من النمط الثاني وأنواع مختلفة من مرض السرطان. كما أنه يساعد على تقوية العظام والعضلات ويزيد من التوازن والمرونة واللياقة البدنية. وأما بالنسبة إلى الأشخاص المسنين، فتساعد الأنشطة البدنية على تحسين التوازن والحد من مخاطر السقوط والإصابات. وبالنسبة إلى الأطفال، يساعد النشاط البدني المنتظم على ضمان النماء والنمو الصحي ويقلل من خطر الإصابة بالأمراض في مرحلة متقدمة من العمر، كما يمكّن الأطفال من تطوير المهارات الحركية الأساسية وبناء العلاقات الاجتماعية.وللنشاط البدني المنتظم أيضا دور في تقوية الصحة العقلية ويمكن أن يقلل من مخاطر الإصابة بالاكتئاب والتدهور المعرفي ويؤخر ظهور الخرف - ويضفي شعورا عاما بالرفاهية.
ما مقدار النشاط البدني الموصى به؟,أصدرت منظمة الصحة العالمية توصيات مفصلة عن مقدار النشاط البدني الذي يجب على الناس من جميع الفئات العمرية مزاولته ليعود بالنفع على صحتهم ورفاههم (انظر الموقع على الإنترنت)[1]. وفيما يلي المستويات الدنيا التي نوصي بها: الرضع الذين تقل أعمارهم عن سنة واحدة يحتاجون إلى الحركة البدنية عدة مرات في اليوم. الأطفال دون سن الخامسة ينبغي أن يمارس الأطفال دون سن الخامسة ما لا يقل عن 180 دقيقة من الأنشطة البدنية يوميا، فيما ينبغي أن يمارس الأطفال بين 3 و 4 أعوام ما لا يقل عن 60 دقيقة يوميا من النشاط البدني المعتدل إلى الشديد يومياً.الأطفال والمراهقون من 5 إلى 17 عاماينبغي أن يمارس جميع الأطفال والمراهقين ما لا يقل عن 60 دقيقة يوميًا من النشاط البدني المعتدل إلى الشديد، بما في ذلك الأنشطة التي تقوي العضلات والعظام ثلاث مرات على الأقل في الأسبوع. البالغون فوق سن 18 عاما ينبغي أن تمارس هذه الفئة العمرية ما لا يقل عن 150 دقيقة من النشاط البدني المعتدل على مدار الأسبوع، أو 75 دقيقة على الأقل من النشاط البدني الشديد على مدار الأسبوع،  بما في ذلك الأنشطة التي تساعد على تقوية العضلات لمدة يومين أو أكثر أسبوعيا.ينبغي أن يمارس المسنون قليلو الحركة النشاط البدني 3 مرات أسبوعيا أو أكثر للحفاظ على التوازن والوقاية من السقوط.وتظل ممارسة أي مستوى من النشاط البدني أفضل من عدمه.  فابدأ إذن بممارسة النشاط البدني لفترة قصيرة تزيدها من حيث المدة والشدة تدريجياً مع مرور الوقت. ومن الصعب علينا جميعا المحافظة على نشاطنا خلال جائحة كوفيد-19.  وبما أن فرص ممارسة النشاط البدني تبدو أكثر تقييدًا، فمن الضروري التخطيط يوميا لطرق تحافظ من خلالها على نشاطك وتقلل من الوقت الذي تقضيه جالسا لفترات طويلة. أي ببساطة، إنها فترة حاسمة  للتأكد من أننا جميعًا نكثر من الحركة ونقلل من الجلوس.   [1] https://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_recommendations/ar/
كيف لي أن أبقى آمناً أثناء ممارسة التمارين الرياضية خلال جائحة كوفيد-19؟,لا تمارس الرياضة إذا كنت تعاني من الحمى والسعال وصعوبة التنفس. الزم منزلك واحرص على أخذ الراحة اللازمة، واطلب العناية الطبية ولكن اتصل أولا هاتفيا بمقدمي الرعاية. واتبع توجيهات سلطات الصحة الوطنية والمحلية في مجتمعك.إذا كان بمقدورك الخروج للمشي أو ركوب الدراجة فاحرص دائمًا على ترك مسافة كافية تفصل بينك وبين الآخرين وعلى غسل يديك بالماء والصابون قبل مغادرتك، وعند وصولك إلى المكان المقصود وبعد عودتك إلى المنزل مباشرة.  وإذا لم يتوفر الماء والصابون فورا، فافرك يديك بمطهر كحولي. إذا ذهبت إلى منتزه أو مكان عمومي مفتوح للمشي أو الركض أو ممارسة الرياضة فاحرص دائمًا على ترك مسافة كافية تفصل بينك وبين الآخرين واغسل يديك بالماء والصابون قبل أن تغادر وعندما تصل إلى مقصدك و بعد عودتك إلى المنزل مباشرة.  وإذا لم يتوفر الماء والصابون فورا، فافرك يديك بمطهر كحولي. واتبع توجيهات هيئة الصحة المحلية في مجتمعك بشأن أي قيود على العدد الأقصى للأشخاص الذين يمكن مصاحبتهم و/أو أي قيود على استخدام المعدات العامة المخصصة للّعب أو للتمارين. إذا لم تكن تمارس عادة أي نشاط، فابدأ ببطء وبأنشطة خفيفة، مثل المشي والتمارين غير المجهدة. وابدأ ممارسة النشاط لفترات قصيرة، مثلا 5 إلى 10 دقائق ثم زدها تدريجيا حتى تصل إلى 30 دقيقة أو أكثر باستمرار على مدى بضعة أسابيع. وممارسة النشاط لفترات قصيرة أكثر تواترا أفضل وأسلم من ممارسته لفترات طويلة عندما لا تكون معتادا على ذلك. ختر النشاط الملائم حتى تقلل من خطر الإصابة وتضمن استمتاعك بهذا النشاط. اختر الشدة المناسبة للتمارين حسب حالتك الصحية ومستوى لياقتك. فينبغي أن تكون قادرًا على التنفس بشكل مريح وعلى التحدث أثناء قيامك بنشاط بدني خفيف ومعتدل.
كيف أظل نشيطا في المنزل وفي الجوار؟,"حاول أن تقلل من فترات الجلوس الطويلة، سواء التي تقضيها في العمل أو الدراسة أو مشاهدة التلفزيون أو القراءة أو استخدام وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي أو اللعب أمام الشاشات الإلكترونية. قلل الجلوس لفترات طويلة من خلال أخذ فترات راحة قصيرة لمدةتتراوح بين 3 إلى 5 دقائق كل 20 إلى 30 دقيقة. قف ومدد عضلاتك والأفضل من ذلك أن تتمشى في أرجاء المنزل أو تصعد وتنزل الدرج أو تتمشى في الحديقة. فبمجرد التحرك والتمدد في المنزل يمكنك تحسين صحتك ورفاهيتك. للمزيد من الأفكار والرسوم التوضيحية عن تمارين التمددالصحي، انظر الرابط أدناه [1].اتبع روتينا منتظما لتظل نشطًا يوميا، من خلال وضع برنامج لممارسة نشاط بدني أو أخذ استراحة لمزاولة التمارين إما لوحدك أو بمتابعة دروس متاحة على الإنترنت أو بتحديد وقت للقيام بنشاط عبر الإنترنت مع أصدقائك أو زملائك. ويساعد تحديد وقت مخصصللنشاط على ضمان ممارسة نشاطك البدني يوميا. ودوّن الوقت الذي تخصصه للنشاط في يومياتك للتذكير. والتزم به لأن ذلك سيساعدك على إرساء روتين منتظم وعلى التكيف مع طرق العمل والدراسة والحياة الأسرية الجديدة التي تفرضها قيود كوفيد-19.كن نشطًا مع أسرتك وأصدقائك، يمكن أن يساعدك التواصل مع الآخرين أنت وأسرتك في المنزل وفي أماكن أخرى على قضاء الوقت سويا وعلى البقاء نشيطًا. إن التخطيط لأوقات محددة لممارسة أنشطة مع أطفالك مثل الألعاب التيتحفّز على النشاط في المنزل أو المشي في المنتزهات العامة أو ركوب الدراجات، يمكن أن يكون وسيلة لاسترخاء جميع أفراد الأسرة وقضاء الوقت معًا والحفاظ على النشاط والتمتع بالصحة أثناء لزوم المنزل.   حدد لنفسك ولأسرتك أهدافًا للحفاظ على النشاط عن طريق اختيار نوع معين منه وتحديد الوقت المناسب لممارسته و/أو عدد الدقائق التي ستمارس خلالها هذا النشاط يوميا. واطلب من كل فرد من أفراد أسرتك أن يحدد لنفسه هدفاً ينطوي على شيء من الصعوبة ولكنيمكن تحقيقه بمساعدة الأهل أو الأصدقاء والإرادة. سجّل التقدم الذي تحرزه في جدول نشاط أسبوعي، وكافئ نفسك بشيء تحبه إن كنت تعتقد أن ذلك سيشجعك.المزيد من الأفكار المتعلقة بالنشاط البدني لمساعدتك على البقاء نشطًاللرضع الذين تقل أعمارهم عن سنة واحدةاقضِ وقتًا منتظمًا مستلقيا على الأرض للعب مع رضيعك (""وقت الاستلقاء على البطن للرضيع"") ووزع ذلك طوال اليوم عندما يكون الرضيع مستيقظًا.للأطفال دون سن الخامسةمارس ألعابا نشطة في المنزل وفي الجوار - فكر في الألعاب التي تنطوي على حركات نشطة وتمكن من تطوير مهارات رمي الأشياء والتقاطها وركلها، بالإضافة إلى المساعدة على تحسين استقامة الجسم والتوازن.اختر الألعاب النشطة والمباريات التي تحفز الأطفال على الحركة الشديدة مثل الجري والقفز وتخطي الحواجز. للأطفال والمراهقين الذين تتراوح أعمارهم من 5 إلى 17 عامانظِّم مباريات وألعاب نشطة بين أفراد الأسرة.انضم إلى دورات عن الألعاب أو الأنشطة المتاحة على الإنترنت، وابحث أيضًا عن دروس التربية البدنية عبر الإنترنت وكذا التمارين الروتينية المناسبة للمراهقين.هيىء ساحة للعب داخل المنزل مثل القفز بالحبل ولعبة المربعات - واصنع ألعابًا وتحديات جديدة تستدعي البقاء نشطا. تعلّم مهارات جديدة - مثلاً تمارين الخفة البهلوانية. تَشجّع على القيام ببعض الأنشطة التدريبية التي تقوي العضلات مثل رفع الأوزان ويمكنك أن تصنع بنفسك الأوزان مستخدما مثلا قنّينات مليئة بالماء أو الرمل.للأشخاص البالغين اصعد الدرج ما أمكنك ذلك، اجعل منه فرصة للحركة. استغل القيام بالأعمال المنزلية كوسيلة لزيادة نشاطك البدني. خصص وقتًا للترفيه، مثل الرقص على نغمات الموسيقى.شارك في فصول التمارين البدنية على الإنترنت أو ابتكر روتينا خاصا بك مثل الرقص على الموسيقى التي تحبها والتي تجعلك تستخدم كتلة العضلات الرئيسية وترفع معدل نبض القلب. قم ببعض الأنشطة لتقوية العضلات مثل رفع الأوزان ويمكنك أن تصنع بنفسك الأوزان مستخدما مثلا قنّينات ممتلئة بالماء أو بكل بساطة استخدم وزن جسمك ممارسا مجموعة من تمارين الضغط وتمارين شد البطن وتمرين القرفصاء.     [1] http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-technical-guidance/stay-physically-active-during-self- quarantine / _recache؟ fbclid = IwAR2RQYVYBnmpDCMjBwqmoz0hZxzmit_9yKzXu6ZhjGNywRTEzWOUQefU8V0"
كم يبلغ عدد البلدان الموبوءة بالملاريا التي بلّغت عن حالات الإصابة بمرض كوفيد-19؟,أبلغت البلدان التي تتوطنها الملاريا في جميع أقاليم المنظمة عن حالات إصابة بمرض كوفيد-19. وفي إقليم المنظمة الأفريقي الذي يتحمّل أكثر من 90% من عبء الملاريا العالمي، أبلغ 37 بلداً عن حالات إصابة بمرض كوفيد-19 حتى 25 آذار/ مارس، منها 10 بلدان أفادت بانتقال مجتمعي للعدوى على المستوى المحلي. وتتاح آخر تقارير الحالة عن جائحة كوفيد-19 على الموقع الإلكتروني للمنظمة.
هل ينبغي مواصلة تنفيذ التدخلات الأساسية لمكافحة نواقل الملاريا نظراً لسرعة انتشار مرض كوفيد-19 على الصعيد العالمي؟,أُبلغ في الأيام الأخيرة عن وقف حملات توزيع الناموسيات المعالجة بمبيدات الحشرات والرش الثمالي داخل المباني في عدة بلدان أفريقية بسبب القلق من مخاطر التعرض لعدوى كوفيد-19. وسيجعل وقف هذه الحملات عدة فئات سكانية ضعيفة أكثر عرضة لخطر الإصابة بالملاريا، ولا سيما صغار الأطفال والنساء الحوامل. وتشجع المنظمة بشدة البلدان على عدم وقف تخطيط أو تنفيذ أنشطة مكافحة النواقل، بما فيها حملات توزيع الناموسيات المعالجة بمبيدات الحشرات والرش الثمالي داخل المباني، على نحو يضمن توفير هذه الخدمات باتباع أفضل الممارسات لحماية العاملين الصحيين والمجتمعات المحلية من عدوى كوفيد-19 في الوقت نفسه. وقد يكون من الضروري تعديل استراتيجيات التوزيع المقررة لتقليل التعرض للعدوى بفيروس كورونا إلى أدنى حد. وقد أتاح التحالف للوقاية من الملاريا إرشادات قيّمة للبرامج الوطنية لمكافحة الملاريا بشأن توزيع الناموسيات المعالجة بمبيدات الحشرات في سياق الاستجابة لجائحة كوفيد-19، وتتسق هذه التوصيات مع الإرشادات العالمية الصادرة عن المنظمة. وفيما يتصل بحملات الرش الثمالي داخل المباني، تدعم المنظمة الإرشادات التي أعدتها مبادرة رئيس الولايات المتحدة لمكافحة الملاريا في سياق جائحة كوفيد-19. وتوصي الإرشادات الأفرقة المعنية بإجراء الرش الثمالي داخل المباني باتخاذ عدة إجراءات منها ما يلي: زيادة عدد مراكز غسل اليدين والصابون في جميع  مواقع العمليات؛ وتعزيز إجراء الفحوص الصحية الصباحية لجميع أعضاء الأفرقة بإضافة فحص درجة حرارة الجسم حيثما أمكن؛ وارتداء كمامات من فئة N-95 ومعدات للوقاية الشخصية قبل دخول مواقع العمليات؛ والمواظبة على مسح أي أسطح تلمسها الأيدي (مقابض الأبواب ودرابزين السيارات وغير ذلك). وإضافة إلى التوصيات المشار إليها أعلاه، ينبغي إتاحة التدابير الوقائية الأساسية التي توصي بها المنظمة لعامة السكان.
هل ينبغي مواصلة توفير العلاجات الوقائية التي توصي بها المنظمة في أفريقيا جنوب الصحراء الكبرى؟,نعم ينبغي مواصلة توفير العلاج الوقائي المتقطع للنساء الحوامل والعلاج الكيميائي الوقائي الموسمي ضد الملاريا والعلاج الوقائي المتقطع للرضع، شريطة اتباع أفضل الممارسات لحماية العاملين الصحيين وغيرهم من العاملين في الخطوط الأمامية للاستجابة لجائحة كوفيد-19. ويسهم ضمان إتاحة هذه الأدوات وغيرها من الأدوات الأساسية للوقاية من الملاريا في إنقاذ الأرواح ويعتبر استراتيجية مهمة لتخفيف الضغط على النُظم الصحية في إطار جهود الاستجابة.وتصف إرشادات جديدة صادرة عن المنظمة الحقوق والأدوار والمسؤوليات الخاصة بالعاملين الصحيين في سياق جائحة كوفيد-19. كما أعدت المنظمة إرشادات للبلدان من أجل مواصلة الخدمات الصحية الأساسية على نحو مأمون أثناء الجائحة.
هل هناك أي تعديلات على إرشادات المنظمة بشأن تشخيص الملاريا وعلاجها؟,ليست هناك أي تعديلات على إرشادات المنظمة. فالتشخيص المبكر والعلاج أمران حاسمان للوقاية من تطوّر حالات الإصابة بالملاريا الخفيفية إلى الحالات الوخيمة أو الوفاة. ولا ينبغي للبلدان أن تقلل جهودها الرامية إلى الكشف عن الملاريا وعلاجها لأن من شأن ذلك أن يقوّض بشكل خطير صحة ورفاهية ملايين الأشخاص المصابين بالعدوى بمرض يُحتمل أن يهدد أرواحهم.
ما هي التدابير الخاصة الإضافية التي قد يكون من الضروري اتخاذها في سياق جائحة كوفيد-19؟,إضافة إلى النُهج الروتينية لمكافحة الملاريا، قد يكون من الضروري اتخاذ تدابير خاصة في سياق جائحة كوفيد-19 مثل تدابير العودة المؤقتة إلى استخدام علاج الحالات المفترضة للإصابة بالملاريا أو التوزيع الواسع النطاق للأدوية التي أثبتت فائدتها في بعض حالات الطوارئ السابقة. ويشير علاج الحالات المفترضة للإصابة بالملاريا إلى علاج حالات الإصابة بالملاريا المشتبه فيها دون تأكيدها التشخيصي (عن طريق اختبار تشخيصي سريع مثلاً). ويقتصر استخدام هذا النهج عادة على الظروف القصوى مثل ظهور المرض في سياقات لم يعد يتوافر فيها التشخيص السريع.  أما توزيع الأدوية على نطاق واسع فهو نهج توصي المنظمة باتباعه للحد من معدلات الوفيات والمراضة الناجمة عن الملاريا بسرعة أثناء الأوبئة وفي سياقات الطوارئ المعقدة. وتوزَّع الأدوية المضادة للملاريا بفضل هذا النهج على جميع أفراد فئة سكانية مستهدفة على فترات متكررة عادةً، بصرف النظر عن ظهور أعراض المرض أو عدم ظهورها عليهم.  ولا ينبغي اعتماد مثل هذه التدابير الخاصة إلا بعد النظر بعناية في هدفين رئيسيين هما: تخفيض معدلات الوفيات المرتبطة بالملاريا والحفاظ على سلامة العاملين الصحيين. وتستكشف المنظمة اقتراحات ملموسة بشأن فترة تفعيل هذه التدابير وطريقة تفعيلها وستُنشر الإرشادات ذات الصلة في الوقت المناسب.
ما هي دواعي قلق المنظمة بوجه خاص بشأن تفشي كوفيد-19 في المناطق الموبوءة بالملاريا؟,بيّنت الخبرة المكتسبة من فاشيات الأمراض السابقة ما لهذه الفاشيات من آثار مدمرة على توفير الخدمات الصحية وعواقبها الوخيمة على أمراض مثل الملاريا. وعلى سبيل المثال، قوّضت فاشية الإيبولا في الفترة 2014-2016 في غينيا وليبريا وسيراليون جهود مكافحة الملاريا وأدت إلى زيادة هائلة في عدد حالات الإصابة بالملاريا والوفاة الناجمة عنها في هذه البلدان الثلاثة. وفي الأسابيع الأخيرة، شكّلت جائحة كوفيد-19 امتحاناً عسيراً لقدرة النُظم الصحية المتينة على الصمود في جميع أنحاء العالم. واعترافاً بالخسائر الفادحة التي تلحقها الملاريا بالسكان الضعفاء في البلدان ذات النظم الصحية الهشة، تشدد المنظمة على الأهمية الحاسمة لاستمرار الجهود المبذولة للوقاية من الملاريا والكشف عنها وعلاجها. وينبغي استخدام التدابير الوقائية في جميع الأقاليم لتقليل خطر انتقال عدوى كوفيد-19 إلى أدنى حد بين المرضى والمجتمعات المحلية ومقدمي الخدمات الصحية. وقد أعدت المنظمة إرشادات مفصلة للعاملين الصحيين في سياق الاستجابة لفاشية كوفيد-19 وإرشادات تشغيلية لمواصلة توفير الخدمات الصحية الأساسية على نحو مأمون.
ما هي الاعتبارات الرئيسية الخاصة بالبلدان التي تعمل من أجل القضاء على الملاريا أو الوقاية من معاودة انتقال المرض؟,تنطبق جميع الاعتبارات المذكورة أعلاه على البلدان التي تعمل على القضاء على الملاريا والبلدان التي تقي من معاودة ظهور المرض. فيجب استمرار الجهود المبذولة للوقاية من حالات الإصابة بالملاريا والكشف عنها وعلاجها مع العمل في الوقت ذاته على الوقاية من تفشي كوفيد-19 وضمان سلامة مقدمي الخدمات. ويجب على البلدان التي تقترب من هدف القضاء على الملاريا أن تحمي مكاسبها المهمة المحققة وتتجنب معاودة ظهور الملاريا. أما البلدان التي قضت على الملاريا بالفعل، فيجب أن تظل على حذر من احتمال ظهور أي حالات ملاريا وافدة للوقاية من معاودة ظهور المرض.
ما هي الأعمال التي تضطلع بها المنظمة لدعم البلدان الموبوءة بالملاريا في سياق جائحة كوفيد-19؟,تعمل المنظمة على نطاق مستوياتها الثلاثة (القطري والإقليمي وفي المقر الرئيسي) لضمان أن أي نصائح تستهدف الوقاية من انتشار فيروس كورونا وتوجيه التدبير العلاجي لمرض كوفيد-19 تتواءم مع السياقات الموبوءة بالملاريا. وقد حددت المنظمة أيضاً، بالتعاون مع شركائها، مجموعة من الإجراءات المترابطة الضرورية لتخفيف وطأة كوفيد-19 في البلدان الأكثر تضرراً من الملاريا. ودعت المنظمة شركاءها مؤخراً إلى بحث مجالات التعاون والتنسيق بهدف تحقيق ما يلي: إعداد معلومات دقيقة واستخدامها ونشرها؛تخفيف مخاطر تعطّل النُظم الصحية؛ضمان استمرار الخدمات الروتينية الخاصة بالملاريا مع إتاحة تدابير خاصة إضافية في بعض السياقات. والمنظمة على استعداد للعمل مع البلدان وسائر الجهات صاحبة المصلحة من أجل تخفيف الأثر السلبي لفيروس كورونا على جهود الاستجابة للملاريا المبذولة في العالم والمساهمة في إنجاح الاستجابة لفاشية كوفيد-19، حيثما أمكن.
هل تعطّل الإمداد بالسلع الأساسية الرئيسية المرتبطة بالملاريا على الصعيد العالمي نتيجة لجائحة كوفيد-19؟,نعم. لقد بُلّغ في الأيام الأخيرة عن تعطّل سلاسل الإمداد بالسلع الأساسية المرتبطة بالملاريا مثل الناموسيات المعالجة بمبيدات الحشرات الطويلة المفعول والاختبارات التشخيصية السريعة والأدوية المضادة للملاريا من جراء تدابير العزل ووقف استيراد السلع وتصديرها استجابةً لمرض كوفيد-19. ومن الضروري تنسيق العمل لضمان توافر الأدوات الرئيسية لمكافحة الملاريا، ولا سيما في البلدان ذات عبء المرض الثقيل، وعدم تعرّض إتاحة خدمات الوقاية من الملاريا وتشخيصها وعلاجها للخطر نتيجة للجهود الرامية إلى الحد من تفشي كوفيد-19.
ما هو موقف المنظمة بشأن استخدام دواءي كلوروكين وهيدروكسي كلوروكوين في سياق الاستجابة لجائحة كوفيد-19؟,"تتابع المنظمة بهمة التجارب السريرية التي تُجرى حالياً استجابةً لجائحة كوفيد-19، بما في ذلك الدراسات عن استخدام دواءي كلوروكين وهيدروكسي كلوروكين المشتق منه لأغراض العلاج و/ أو الوقاية. ولا تتوافر في الوقت الحالي بيانات كافية لتقييم نجاعة هذين الدواءين في علاج الأشخاص المصابين بمرض كوفيد-19 أو في الوقاية من الإصابة بعدوى فيروس كورونا. وتوصي المنظمة حالياً باستخدام دواء كلوروكين لعلاج الملاريا التي تسببها المتصوّرة النشطة. وفي سياق الاستجابة لجائحة كوفيد-19، فإن البرنامج قيد النظر حالياً للعلاج بعقاري كلوروكين وهيدروكسي كلوروكين وتحديد جرعاتهما لا يمسّ المخزون المتاح لعلاج المصابين بالملاريا. وقد يسفر تناول جرعات كبيرة من هذين الدواءين عن حصائل صحية ضارة أو ضارة بشكل خطير. وتعتمد المنظمة في حالات طوارئ الصحة العمومية على عملية منهجية وشفافة للبحث والتطوير، ولا سيما لإجراء التجارب السريرية المتعلقة بالأدوية. ويهدف ""مخطط المنظمة الأولي للبحث والتطوير"" في سياق فاشية كوفيد-19، المستهل في 7 كانون الثاني/ يناير 2020، إلى تسريع وتيرة التوصل إلى فحوص ولقاحات وأدوية ناجعة يمكن استخدامها لإنقاذ الأرواح وتجنب الأزمات الواسعة النطاق. وقد صممت المنظمة أيضاً مجموعة من الإجراءات لتقييم أداء التكنولوجيات الطبية وجودتها ومأمونيتها خلال حالات الطوارئ."
هل يزداد خطر التعرض للعدوى بمرض كوفيد-19 لدى المصابين بعدوى فيروس العوز المناعي البشري؟,يزداد خطر التعرض للعدوى بالأمراض ومضاعفاتها بصفة عامة لدى الأشخاص المصابين بمرض فيروس العوز المناعي البشري المتقدم وأولئك الذين تنخفض لديهم خلايا CD4 ويرتفع لديهم الحمل الفيروسي ولا يخضعون للعلاج بالأدوية المضادة للفيروسات القهقرية. وليس من المعروف ماإذا كان الكبت المناعي الذي يسببه فيروس العوز المناعي البشري سيزيد من خطر تعرض شخص للعدوى بمرض كوفيد-19. وعليه، ما لم تزداد المعارف في هذا الصدد، ينبغي اتخاذ تدابير احتياطية إضافية فيما يخص جميع الأشخاص المصابين بمرض فيروس العوز المناعي البشري المتقدمأو الخاضع لمراقبة ضعيفة.[1]،[2]وفي الوقت الحالي، ليس هناك ما يدل على وجود اختلاف في التعرض لخطر الإصابة بعدوى كوفيد-19 أو مضاعفاته لدى المصابين بالعدوى بفيروس العوز المناعي البشري الذين يكون وضعهم السريري والمناعي مستقراً ويتلقون العلاج بالأدوية المضادة للفيروسات القهقرية مقارنة بعامةالناس. وقد يعاني بعض المصابين بعدوى فيروس العوز المناعي البشري من عوامل خطر يُعرف أنها تسبب مضاعفات مرض كوفيد-19، مثل السكري وارتفاع ضغط الدم والأمراض غير السارية الأخرى، وقد يزيد من هذا المنطلق خطر تعرضهم لمضاعفات كوفيد-19 غير المرتبطة بفيروس العوزالمناعي البشري. ونعلم أنه لم يبلَّغ إلا عن عدد قليل من حالات الإصابة بمرض خفيف لدى المصابين بفيروس العوز المناعي البشري إبان فاشيات متلازمة الالتهاب الرئوي الحاد الوخيم ومتلازمة الشرق الأوسط التنفسية. وحتى الآن، هناك تقرير فردي عن شخص مصاب بعدوى فيروس العوز المناعي البشري أُصيب بمرض كوفيد-19 وتعافى منه[3] ودراسة صغيرة عن عوامل الخطر والأدوية المضادة للفيروسات القهقرية المستخدمة لدى المصابين بعدوى فيروس العوز المناعي البشري ومرض كوفيد-19 صدراعن الصين. وبلّغت هذه الدراسة عن تسجيل معدلات مماثلة للإصابة بمرض كوفيد-19 مقارنة بجميع السكان وعن زيادة خطر التعرض لهذا المرض مع التقدم في السن وليس عند انخفاض مستوى خلايا CD4 أو ارتفاع الحمل الفيروسي أو الخضوع لنظام العلاج بالأدوية المضادة للفيروساتالقهقرية.[4] وتشير البيانات السريرية الحالية إلى ارتباط عوامل الخطر الرئيسية المسببة للوفيات بالتقدم في السن والإصابة بأمراض مصاحبة أخرى تشمل أمراض القلب والأوعية الدموية والسكري وأمراض الجهاز التنفسي المزمنة وارتفاع ضغط الدم. وقد أصيب بعض الأشخاصالمتمتعين بصحة جيدة جداً بالمضاعفات الوخيمة لعدوى فيروس كورونا.[5] ويوصى المصابون بفيروس العوز المناعي البشري باتخاذ التدابير الاحتياطية ذاتها التي يوصى بها عامة الناس:[6]،[7]تكرار غسل اليدينالالتزام بآداب السعالالتباعد عن الآخرينالتماس الرعاية الطبية عند ظهور الأعراضالعزل الذاتي عند مخالطة شخص مصاب بمرض كوفيد-19اتخاذ إجراءات أخرى وفقاً لاستجابة الحكومة وينبغي للمصابين بفيروس العوز المناعي البشري الذين يتلقون علاجاً بالأدوية المضادة للفيروسات القهقرية التزود بكمية من الأدوية تغطي فترة لا تقل عن 30 يوماً وتصل إلى ستة أشهر والتأكد من تجديد اللقاحات اللازمة (لقاح الأنفلونزا ولقاح المكورات الرئوية).وينبغي أيضاً ضمان التزود بكميات كافية من الأدوية لعلاج حالات العدوى المصاحبة والأمراض المصاحبة والإدمان.
هل يمكن استخدام الأدوية المضادة للفيروسات القهقرية لعلاج مرض كوفيد-19؟,أشارت عدة دراسات إلى الحصائل السريرية الجيدة التي تحقّقت لدى المرضى المصابين بعدوى الفيروس المسبب لمرض كوفيد-19 والعدوى بفيروسات كورونا ذات الصلة (فيروس كورونا المسبب لمتلازمة الالتهاب الرئوي الحاد الوخيم وفيروس كورونا المسبب لمتلازمة الشرق الأوسط التنفسية)، إذ تعافى معظم المرضى بالكامل. وقد أُعطي المرضى في بعض الحالات دواء مضاد للفيروسات القهقرية أي دواء لوبينافير المعزز بدواء ريتونافير (الدواء المركب لوبينافير/ريتونافير). وأُجريت هذه الدراسات أساساً على أفراد غير حاملين لفيروس العوز المناعي البشري. ومن المهم ملاحظة القيود الكبيرة التي انطوت عليها تلك الدراسات المعتمدة على استخدام الدواء المركب لوبينافير/ريتونافير. فقد كانت الدراسات صغيرة واختلف العلاج من حيث توقيته ومدته وجرعاته واستفاد معظم المرضى من تدخلات/علاجات مصاحبة لا يُستبعد أنها ساهمت في تحقيق الحصائل المبلّغ عنها.  وعلى الرغم من أن مستوى اليقين منخفض جداً من حيث البيّنات على فائدة استخدام الأدوية المضادة للفيروسات القهقرية لعلاج حالات العدوى بفيروس كورونا، فقد كانت الآثار الجانبية الخطيرة نادرة. ويرتبط الاستخدام الروتيني للدواء المركب لوبينافير/ريتونافير كعلاج لفيروس العوز المناعي البشري لدى المصابين به بعدة آثار جانبية معتدلة. ومع ذلك، نظراً لاقتصار مدة العلاج لدى المرضى المصابين بالعدوى بفيروس كورونا على بضعة أسابيع بصفة عامة، فمن الممكن توقع أن يكون مستوى هذه الآثار الجانبية منخفضاً أو أقل من المستويات المبلغ عنها نتيجة الاستخدام الروتيني.
هل يمكن استخدام الأدوية المضادة للفيروسات القهقرية للوقاية من العدوى بمرض كوفيد-19؟,أفادت دراستان باستخدام الدواء المركب لوبينافير/ريتونافير كعلاج وقائي بعد التعرض لفيروس كورونا المسبب لمتلازمة الالتهاب الرئوي الحاد الوخيم وفيروس كورونا المسبب لمتلازمة الشرق الأوسط التنفسية. وأشارت إحدى الدراستين إلى انخفاض حالات الإصابة بالعدوى بفيروس كورونا المسبب لمتلازمة الشرق الأوسط التنفسية لدى العاملين الصحيين الذين تلقوا الدواء المركب مقارنة بالعاملين الصحيين الذين لم يتعاطوا أي أدوية. وتبيّن الدراسة الأخرى انعدام حالات العدوى بفيروس كورونا المسبب لمتلازمة الالتهاب الرئوي الحاد الوخيم (سارس) لدى 19 شخصاً مصاباً بعدوى فيروس العوز المناعي البشري كانوا يتلقون العلاج في المستشفى في نفس الجناح الذي كان يستضيف المرضى المصابين بمتلازمة سارس، علماً أن 11 شخصاً منهم يتلقى علاجا بالأدوية المضادة للفيروسات القهقرية. ومرة أخرى، يعتبر مستوى اليقين من حيث البيّنات المتوافرة منخفضاً جداً نتيجة لصغر حجم العينات وتباين الأدوية المستخدمة وعدم اليقين بشأن حدة التعرض.
ما هي الدراسات المقرر إجراؤها بشأن علاج مرض كوفيد-19 والوقاية منه باستخدام الأدوية المضادة للفيروسات ‏القهقرية؟,من المقرر إجراء عدة تجارب عشوائية لتقييم مأمونية ونجاعة الأدوية المضادة للفيروسات القهقرية، ولا سيما الدواء المركب لوبينافير/ريتونافير، من أجل علاج مرض كوفيد-19 باستخدام هذه الأدوية بالاقتران مع أدوية أخرى. ويتوقع الإعلان عن النتائج اعتباراً من منتصف عام 2020.
ما هو موقف المنظمة بشأن استخدام الكورتيكوستيرويدات في علاج مرض كوفيد-19؟,تنصح الإرشادات المبدئية الحالية الصادرة عن المنظمة بشأن التدبير العلاجي السريري للعدوى التنفسية الحادة الوخيمة عند الاشتباه في العدوى بمرض كوفيد-19 بعدم استخدام الكورتيكوستيرويدات ما لم يوص باستخدامها لسبب آخر.[8]وتستند هذه الإرشادات إلى عدة استعراضات منهجية تشير إلى عدم فعالية العلاج الروتيني بالكورتيكوستيرويدات لمكافحة الالتهاب الرئوي الفيروسي أو متلازمة الضائقة التنفسية الحادة واحتمال التضرر منه.[9]
ما هو موقف المنظمة بشأن استخدام الأدوية المضادة للفيروسات القهقرية من أجل علاج مرض كوفيد-19؟,لا تتوافر حالياً بيانات كافية لتقييم نجاعة الدواء المركب لوبينافير/ريتونافير أو غيره من الأدوية المضادة للفيروسات في علاج مرض كوفيد-19. وتعكف عدة بلدان على تقييم استخدام الدواء المركب لوبينافير/ريتونافير وغيره من الأدوية المضادة للفيروسات وترحب المنظمة بالنتائج التي ستتوصل إليها هذه التحريات.  ومجدداً، في إطار استجابة المنظمة للفاشية، جرى تفعيل مخطط المنظمة الأولي للبحث والتطويربهدف تسريع وتيرة تقييم الوسائل التشخيصية واللقاحات والعلاجات الخاصة بفيروس كورونا المستجد. وصممت المنظمة أيضاً مجموعة من الإجراءات لتقييم أداء التكنولوجيات الطبية وجودتها ومأمونيتها خلال حالات الطوارئ.
هل هناك ما يثير القلق بشأن حدوث نقص في الأدوية المضادة للفيروسات القهقرية لمعالجة المصابين بعدوى فيروس ‏العوز المناعي البشري إذا استخدمت البلدان هذه الأدوية لعلاج مرض كوفيد-19؟,تمثل الأدوية المضادة للفيروسات القهقرية علاجاً ناجعاً مُحتملاً جداً للمصابين بعدوى فيروس العوز المناعي البشري. ويجري حاليا تحري إمكانية استخدام الدواء المركب لوبينافير/ريتونافير المضاد للفيروسات القهقرية كعلاج محتمل لمرض كوفيد-19. وفي حال استخدام هذه الأدوية لعلاج مرض كوفيد-19، ينبغي وضع خطة تضمن وجود إمدادات كافية ومستمرة لتلبية احتياجات جميع المصابين بفيروس العوز المناعي البشري الذين يستخدمون أصلاً الدواء المركب لوبينافير/ريتونافير والأشخاص الذين سيحتاجون إلى بدء العلاج. ومع ذلك، هناك نسبة صغيرة نسبياً من الأشخاص الذين يتبعون علاجاً يشمل الدواء المركب نظراً إلى استخدامه كعلاج من الخط الثاني وفقاً للمبادئ التوجيهية للمنظمة بشأن علاج العدوى بفيروس العوز المناعي البشري. ويجب على أي بلد يسمح باستخدام الأدوية المضادة لفيروس العوز المناعي البشري لعلاج مرض كوفيد-19 أن يضمن توفير إمدادات كافية ومستدامة.
ما هي الطرق المتبعة لضمان حقوق الإنسان ومكافحة الوصم والتمييز؟,إذ يكثف العالم استجاباته الصحية العمومية لجائحة كوفيد-19، تُحث البلدان على اتخاذ إجراءات حاسمة لمكافحة الوباء. وقد حثت المنظمة جميع البلدان على ضمان التوازن المناسب بين حماية الصحة ومنع الاضطرابات الاقتصادية والاجتماعية واحترام حقوق الإنسان. وتعمل المنظمة مع شركاء من بينهم برنامج الأمم المتحدة المشترك لمكافحة الأيدز والشبكة العالمية للمصابين بالعدوى بفيروس العوز المناعي البشري، لضمان عدم تقويض حقوق الإنسان في إطار الاستجابة لمرض كوفيد-19، وكفالة إتاحة الخدمات للمصابين بعدوى فيروس العوز المناعي البشري أو المتأثرين بها دون التمييز بينهم وبين سائر الأشخاص، وتوفير الخدمات ذات الصلة باستمرار ودون تعطيل. وسعياً إلى تخفيف وطأة الفاشيات المحتملة لمرض كوفيد-19 في السجون وتخفيض معدلات المراضة والوفيات لدى الأشخاص في السجون وفي الأماكن الأخرى المغلقة، من الأساسي إدماج السجون ومراكز احتجاز المهاجرين في استجابة الصحة العمومية الأوسع نطاقاً. وهذا أمر يقتضي التعاون الوثيق بين وزارات الصحة والعدل وينطوي على تطبيق بروتوكولات لإجراء الفحوص قبل الدخول واتخاذ تدابير الحماية الشخصية وتجنب الاقتراب الشديد من الناس وتنظيف البيئة وتعقيمها وتقييد الحركة، بما في ذلك تقييد النقل والوصول فيما يخص الموظفين غير الأساسيين والزائرين. وفي السياق الحالي، من الأهمية بمكان أن تعمل البلدان من أجل وضع استراتيجيات غير احتجازية لمنع اكتظاظ الأماكن المغلقة.[10] ويُرجح أن يتيسير تحقيق ذلك إذا تولت وزارة الصحة عوضاً عن وزارة العدل أو غيرها، تصريف شؤون الصحة في السجون.[11]
كيف يمكن للبرامج أن تضمن استمرار إتاحة الخدمات المتعلقة بفيروس العوز المناعي البشري؟,من المهم ضمان استمرار إتاحة خدمات الوقاية والتحري والعلاج الأساسية فيما يتعلق بفيروس العوز المناعي البشري، لا سيما عند اتخاذ تدابير العزل في إطار استجابة الصحة العمومية لجائحة كوفيد-19. وفي حين يتعين مواصلة إتاحة هذه الخدمات الأساسية، فينبغيالنظر في تدابير مكيّفة ومسنّدة بالبيّنات للحد من احتمال نقل العدوى وتنفيذ هذه التدابير التي تشمل ما يلي:[12] تطبيق الاحتياطات النموذجية على جميع المرضى (بما في ذلك ضمان أن يغطي كل مريض أنفه وفمه بمنديل ورقي أو بثني المرفق عند السعال أو العطس؛ وتوزيع كمامات طبية على المرضى الذين يُشتبه في إصابتهم بعدوى كوفيد-19 ريثما ينتظرون الحصول على خدمات الرعاية،والتقيد بقواعد نظافة اليدين وغير ذلك).ضرورة اعتماد تدابير مكيّفة للتقيد بقواعد نظافة اليدين لدى العاملين في مجالي الرعاية الصحية والتوعية والإرشاد والأشخاص المستفيدين من خدماتهم.ضمان فرز الحالات والكشف المبكر عنها ومراقبة مصدر العدوى (بعزل المرضى المشتبه في إصابتهم بعدوى كوفيد-19).ضمان وجود تهوية كافية في جميع الأماكن داخل مرفق الرعاية الصحية.ضرورة الحفاظ على مسافة لا تقل عن متر واحد على الأمثل بين جميع المرضى داخل جميع الأقسام.ضرورة التقيد بإجراءات التنظيف والتعقيم المتكرر وبشكل صحيح.صرف الأدوية اللازمة (لعلاج العدوى بفيروس العوز المناعي البشري والسل والاعتلالات المزمنة الأخرى مثل الاعتماد على المواد الأفيونية) لتغطية فترات أطول، مما يسمح بالحد من عدد زيارات المرضى.النظر في الاقتصار على تقديم الخدمات الأساسية (توفير خدمات العلاج والوقاية الأساسية؛ وإمكانية الحد من خدمات مثل خدمات الإرشاد أو تكييفها). وعموماً، قد يزيد خطر التعرض للعدوى في صفوف الفئات السكانية الأضعف، بمن فيهم أفراد من فئات سكانية رئيسية، والأشخاص بلا مأوى و/ أو المشردين، بسبب تأثير الأمراض المصاحبة الإضافية على جهازهم المناعي وعجزهم عن على تطبيق تدابير العزل والمباعدة بينالأشخاص وحصولهم المحدود بصفة عامة على الخدمات الصحية. ومن الأساسي أن يتسنى للخدمات التي تستهدف هذه الفئات السكانية، مثل الخدمات المجتمعية ومراكز الاستقبال وخدمات التوعية، الاستمرار في توفير خدمات الوقاية (توزيع العوازل الذكرية والإبر والمحاقن)والتحري والعلاج المنقذة للأرواح، على نحو يضمن سلامة الموظفين والأشخاص المستفيدين من خدماتهم. ويمكن تكييف الخدمات وفقاً للاعتبارات الواردة أعلاه عند الاقتضاء.
ما هو دور وصف الأدوية المضادة للفيروسات القهقرية والأدوية الأخرى وصرفها لتغطية عدة أشهر؟,يمكن للأشخاص الذين يكون وضعهم السريري مستقراً من البالغين والأطفال والنساء الحوامل والمرضعات والأفراد من فئات سكانية رئيسية (متعاطو المخدرات حقناً والعاملون في الجنس والرجال الذين يمارسون الجنس مع الرجال والمتحوِّلون جنسياً والمودعون في السجن أو أماكن أخرى مغلقة) أن يستفيدوا من نماذج مبسطة لتوفير العلاج بالأدوية المضادة للفيروسات القهقرية، تشمل وصف الأدوية وصرفها لتغطية عدة أشهر (إمدادات لمدة تتراوح بين 3 و6 أشهر) مما يؤدي إلى الحد من عدد الزيارات في السياقات السريرية ويضمن استمرار العلاج في حال تعطل الحركة الممكن خلال فاشية فيروس كورونا. وينبغي النظر كذلك في زيادة فرص حصول الأشخاص الذين يكون وضعهم السريري مستفرا بالعلاج البديل بواسطة الميثادون أو البوبرينورفين، على هذه الأدوية في المنزل بغية تخفيف العبء الإضافي عن كاهل قطاع الصحة.
هل يمكن للمرأة المصابة بعدوى فيروس العوز المناعي البشري أن تنقل فيروس مرض كوفيد-19 إلى الجنين أو ‏الرضيع أثناء الحمل أو بعد الولادة؟,تتوافر بيانات قليلة بشأن المظاهر السريرية لمرض كوفيد-19 لدى فئات سكانية محددة مثل الأطفال والحوامل[13] إلا أن نتائج دراسة صغيرة منشورة تشير إلى عدم وجود بيّنات في الوقت الحالي تدلّ على الإصابة بالعدوى داخل الرحم بسبب الانتقال العمودى من الأم إلى الجنين لدى النساء اللواتي يُصبن بالالتهاب الرئوي الناجم عن مرض كوفيد-19 في المرحلة الأخيرة من الحمل.[14] وعلى الرغم من عدم توثيق انتقال العمودى للعدوى، فإن انتقالها بعد الولادة عن طريق الاحتكاك بإفرازات تنفسية معدية يظل مثاراً للقلق. وينبغي تغذية الرضع لأمهات مصابات بعدوى كوفيد-19 مشتبه فيها أو محتملة أو مؤكدة، وفقاً للمبادئ التوجيهية النموذجية لتغذية الرضع،[15] باتخاذ التدابير الاحتياطية اللازمة للوقاية من العدوى ومكافحتها. وعلى غرار جميع حالات الإصابة بمرض كوفيد-19 المؤكدة أو المشتبه فيها، ينبغي للأمهات اللواتي تظهر عليهن أعراض المرض ويرضعن مواليدهن أو يتبعن ممارسة ملامسة بشرة الطفل لبشرة الأم أو طريقة الكنغر لرعاية الطفل، أن يحرصن على ممارسات النظافة التنفسية، بما في ذلك لدى تغذية الطفل (باستخدام كمامة طبية مثلاً عند مقاربة الطفل في حالة ظهور أعراض تنفسية على الأم)، والتقيد بقواعد نظافة اليدين قبل ملامسة الطفل وبعدها وتنظيف كل ما يلمسنه وتعقيمه بشكل روتيني.[16]
هل ينبغي توفير التدبير العلاجي بصورة مختلفة للمرأة الحامل والمرضعة المصابة بعدوى فيروس العوز المناعي البشري ‏ومرض كوفيد-19 ومولودها؟,"لا يوجد حالياً أي اختلاف معروف بين المظاهر السريرية لمرض كوفيد-19 أو خطر الإصابة بمرض وخيم أو تعرض الجنين للخطر لدى النساء الحوامل وغير الحوامل أو البالغات في سن الإنجاب. وينبغي أن تحصل النساء الحوامل أو اللاتي كن حوامل مؤخراً،  المشتبه في إصابتهن بمرض كوفيد-19 أو تأكدت إصابتهن به، على خدمات الدعم والتدبير العلاجي، مع مراعاة التغيرات المناعية والفسيولوجية أثناء الحمل وبعده التي قد تتداخل مع أعراض مرض كوفيد-19. ورغم البيانات المحدودة إلا أنه ينبغي إيلاء عناية خاصة للحوامل اللاتي يعانين من أمراض متزامنة وتُحتمل إصابتهن بعدوى كوفيد-19، ما لم توفر قاعدة البيّنات المتاحة معلومات أوضح في هذا الصدد. ولم يبلَّغ عن أي حالات وفاة لدى النساء الحوامل حتى وقت نشر هذه المعلومات[17] غير أنه قد يتعين منح الأولوية لإجراء فحص الكشف عن مرض كوفيد-19 لدى الحوامل اللواتي تظهر عليهن الأعراض لتمكينهن من الحصول على الرعاية المتخصصة. كما ينبغي تزويد جميع النساء اللاتي كن حوامل مؤخراً المصابات بمرض كوفيد-19 أو المتعافيات منه بالمعلومات والمشورة بشأن تغذية الرضع المأمونة والتدابير الملائمة للوقاية من العدوى ومكافحتها بغرض الوقاية من انتقال عدوى الفيروس المسبب لكوفيد-19.[18] وفي حال تأكيد الإصابة بالمرض أو أثناء تحريها، يكون التدبير العلاجي مماثلاً للتدبير العلاجي المتاح للنساء غير الحوامل باتخاذ تدابير العزل المناسبة. ويجب إبلاغ مرافق التوليد وتهيئتها، علماً بأنه ينبغي اعتبار أي مولود تؤكد إصابة أمه بمرض كوفيد-19 ""موضع تحرٍ"" وعزله وفقاً للإرشادات بشأن الوقاية من العدوى ومكافحتها. وفي الوقت الحالي، ليس من المعلوم ما إذا كان المواليد المصابون بمرض كوفيد-19 أكثر عرضةً للإصابة بمضاعفات وخيمة."
هل المدخنون ومستخدمو منتجات التبغ أكثر عرضةً لعدوى كوفيد-19؟,من الأرجح أن المدخنين أكثر عرضةً لمخاطر كوفيد-19 لأن ممارسة التدخين بحد ذاتها تعني أن الأصابع (وربما السجائر الملوثة) تلامس الشفتين بشكل مستمر، مما يزيد من احتمالات انتقال الفيروس من اليد إلى الفم. ولا يستبعد كذلك أن يكون المدخنين مصابين بالفعل بمرض رئوي أو يعانون من ضعف في وظائف الرئة، مما يزيد من احتمالات تعرضهم لمضاعفات خطيرة.كما أن أدوات التدخين، مثل الغليون (الشيشة)، كثيراً ما تنطوي على استخدام قطع التنشق والخراطيم نفسها لأكثر من شخص، مما قد يسهل انتقال عدوى كوفيد-19 في الأوساط المحلية والاجتماعية.والظروف التي تزيد الحاجة إلى الأكسجين أو تحدّ من قدرة الجسم على توظيفه كما ينبغي تعرّض المرضى بشكل أكبر لخطر الإصابة بأمراض رئوية خطيرة كالالتهاب الرئوي.
هل النساء الحوامل أكثر عرضة للتأثر بمرض كوفيد-19؟,هناك أبحاث جارية حالياً لفهم آثار الإصابة بعدوى كوفيد-19 على الحوامل. ولا تزال البيانات محدودة في هذا الشأن، ولكن لا يوجد دليل حالياً على أن الحوامل أكثر عرضة للإصابة بمرض وخيم من بقية السكان. غير أنه نظراً للتغيرات التي يتعرض لها جسم المرأة الحامل وجهازها المناعي، فمن المعلوم أن بعض الأمراض التنفسية قد يكون لها تأثير سيء على الحوامل. لذلك من المهم أن يتخذن تدابير احتياطية لحماية أنفسهن من مرض كوفيد-19 وأن يبلغن الطبيب أو مقدم الرعاية الصحية بأي أعراض ممكنة (بما في ذلك الحمى والسعال أو صعوبة التنفس).وستواصل المنظمة استعراض هذه المعلومات والنصائح وتحديثها كلما توافر المزيد من البيّنات في هذا الصدد.
أنا امرأة حامل، كيف يمكنني حماية نفسي من الإصابة بمرض كوفيد-19؟,ينبغي للنساء الحوامل اتباع نفس التدابير الاحتياطية التي يتبعها عامة الناس لتحاشي الإصابة بعدوى كوفيد-19. وتشمل تدابير الحماية ما يلي:المواظبة على غسل اليدين بمطهر كحولي لليدين أو بالماء والصابون.الحفاظ على مسافة بينك وبين الآخرين.تجنب لمس العينين والأنف والفم.الحرص على النطافة التنفسية. ويعني ذلك تغطية الفم والأنف بثني المرفق أو بمنديل ورقي عند العطس أو السعال، ثم التخلص من المنديل المستعمل على الفور.إذا كنت مصابة بالحمى أو السعال أو صعوبة في التنفس، فالتمسي الرعاية الطبية مبكرا. واتصلي بمرفق الرعاية الصحية قبل التوجه إليه واتبعي تعليمات السلطات الصحية المحلية.وينبغي أن تحرص النساء الحوامل أو اللاتي وضعن مؤخراً، بمن فيهن المصابات بمرض كوفيد-19، على متابعة مواعيد الزيارات الطبية الروتينية.
هل ينبغي فحص النساء الحوامل لتحري إصابتهن بمرض كوفيد-19؟,تتفاوت بروتوكولات الفحص وأهليته حسب بلد الإقامة. غير أن المنظمة توصي بإعطاء الأولوية في إجراء الفحوص للحوامل اللاتي تظهر عليهن أعراض مرض كوفيد-19. وإذا كانت نتيجة الفحص إيجابية فقد يحتجن إلى رعاية متخصصة.
هل يمكن أن ينتقل فيروس مرض كوفيد-19 من المرأة إلى جنينها أو وليدها؟,ما زلنا نجهل ما إذا كان بوسع المرأة الحامل المصابة بكوفيد-19 نقل الفيروس إلى جنينها أو رضيعها أثناء الحمل أو الولادة. ولم يُعثر على الفيروس حتى الآن في عيّنات الحمض الأميني أو في حليب الأم.
ما نوع الرعاية التي ينبغي توفيره أثناء الحمل والولادة؟,يحق لجميع الحوامل، بمن فيهن المصابات بعدوى كوفيد-19 المؤكدة أو المشتبه فيها، الحصول على رعاية طبية عالية الجودة قبل الولادة وأثناءها وبعدها. ويشمل ذلك الرعاية في فترة ما قبل الولادة وأثناء الولادة وما بعدها والرعاية الصحية النفسية. وتشمل تجربة الولادة المأمونة والإيجابية ما يلي:المعاملة باحترام وعلى نحو يحفظ الكرامة؛حضور مرافق تختاره المرأة أثناء الولادة؛الحصول على معلومات واضحة من موظفي الأمومة؛بحث الاستراتيجيات المناسبة لتخفيف الألم؛الحق في التحرك أثناء الوضع، قدر الإمكان، واختيار وضعية الولادة. وفي حالة الإصابة بعدوى كوفيد-19 المشتبه فيها أو المؤكدة، فينبغي لعاملي الرعاية الصحية اتخاذ الاحتياطات المناسبة للحد من مخاطر انتقال العدوى إليهم أو إلى الآخرين، بما في ذلك ارتداء الملابس الواقية.
هل يتعين على الحوامل المصابات بعدوى كوفيد-19 المؤكدة أو المشتبه فيها الخضوع لولادة قيصرية؟,لا. توصي المنظمة باقتصار الولادة القيصرية على الحالات المبررة طبياً.  ينبغي تحديد إجراء الولادة في كل حالة على حدة استناداً إلى رغبة المرأة وتفضيلها بالإضافة إلى رأي أخصائي التوليد.
هل يمكن للمرأة المصابة بمرض كوفيد-19 أن ترضع طفلها؟,نعم. يمكن للنساء المصابات بمرض كوفيد-19 ممارسة الرضاعة الطبيعية إن رغبن في ذلك. ويتعين عليهن اتباع التدابير التالية:تطبيق ممارسات النظافة التنفسية أثناء الرضاعة ووضع كمامة إذا توفرت؛غسل اليدين قبل لمس الرضيع وبعد لمسه؛ تنظيف الأسطح التي يلامسنها وتعقيمها بشكل مستمر.
هل بإمكاني لمس وليدي وحمله إذا كنت مصابة بكوفيد-19؟,نعم. فالاتصال الوثيق والمبكر مع المولود ورضاعته بالثدي يساعدان في نموه. وينبغي أن تحصل الأم على الدعم والتشجيع للقيام بما يلي:الرضاعة المأمونةمع الحرص على ممارسات النظافة التنفسية السليمة؛حمل المولودواحتضانه بحيث تلتصق بشرته ببشرة الأم؛نوم الرضيع في نفسالغرفة مع أمه.وينبغي أن تغسلي يديك قبل لمس رضيعك وبعد لمسه وأن تحافظى على نظافة جميع الأسطح.
أنا مصابة بمرض كوفيد-19 وأشعر بتوعك شديد لا يسمح لي بإرضاع طفلي مباشرة. ماذا أفعل؟,إذا كنت تشعرين بتوعك شديد يمنعك من إرضاع طفلك مباشرة سواء بسبب مرض كوفيد-19 أو غيره من المضاعفات، فينبغي أن تلتمسي الدعم لتوفير حليبك لطفلك على  نحو مأمون وبطريقة مناسبة ومتاحة ومقبولة لك. ويمكن أن يشمل ذلك ما يلي:استخراج الحليب من الثدي؛استدرار الحليب بعد انقطاعه؛الحصول على حليب أم متبرعة.
ما هي أوجه الشبه بين فيروس كوفيد-19 وفيروس الإنفلونزا؟,أولاً، يسبب كلٌ من فيروس كوفيد-19 وفيروس الإنفلونزا أعراضاً متشابهة. فكلاهما يسبب مرضاً تنفسياً يتجلى في اعتلالات واسعة النطاق تتراوح من انعدام الأعراض أو الأعراض الخفيفة إلى المرض الوخيم وحتى الوفاة.ثانياً، كلا الفيروسين ينتقل باللمس والقطيرات والأدوات المعدية. وبالتالي فإن تدابير الصحة العامة نفسها، كتنظيف اليدين وآداب النظافة التنفسية (أي السعال بطي المرفق أو في منديل ورقي يتم التخلص منه على الفور بعد ذلك)، تعدّ تدابير مهمة قد تكفي للوقاية من العدوى.
ما هي أوجه الاختلاف بين فيروس كوفيد-19 وفيروس الإنفلونزا؟,تعدّ سرعة الانتقال نقطة اختلاف هامة بين الفيروسين. فمتوسط فترة حضانة فيروس الإنفلونزا (أي الفترة من لحظة العدوى حتى ظهور الأعراض) وكذلك فترة الفاصل التسلسلي (أي المدة الفاصلة بين الحالات المتعاقبة) كلتاهما أقصر من فيروس كوفيد-19. ففترة الفاصل التسلسلي لفيروس كوفيد-19 تُقدّر بين 5 و6 أيام، في حين تبلغ 3 أيام بالنسبة لفيروس الإنفلونزا. وهو ما يعني أن الإنفلونزا يمكن أن تنتشر بوتيرة أسرع من كوفيد-19. كما أن انتقال الفيروس في الأيام 3 إلى 5 الأولى من المرض، أو ربما انتقاله في الفترة السابقة لظهور الأعراض، هو عامل انتقال رئيسي بالنسبة للإنفلونزا. وبالمقابل، في حين تعلمنا أن هناك أشخاصاً بإمكانهم طرح فيروس كوفيد-19 قبل 24 إلى 48 ساعة من بداية ظهور الأعراض، فلا يبدو في الوقت الراهن أن ذلك يشكّل عاملاً رئيسياً في انتقال العدوى.ومن المفهوم أن معدل التكاثر الأساسي – أي عدد العدواى الثانوية التي تنتج عن كل فرد مصاب بالعدوى – يتراوح بين 2 و2.5 بالنسبة لفيروس كوفيد-19، وهو أعلى من معدل التكاثر بالنسبة لفيروس الإنفلونزا. غير أن التقديرات المتعلقة بكل من فيروس كوفيد-19 وفيروس الإنفلونزا ترتبط بسياق وفترة زمنية محددين، مما يجعل من الصعب عقد مقارنات مباشرة بينهما.والأطفال عامل مهم في نقل فيروس الإنفلونزا وسط المجتمع المحلي. أما بالنسبة لفيروس كوفيد-19، فتشير البيانات الأولية إلى أن الأطفال أقل تعرضاً للعدوى من البالغين وأن معدلات النوبات السريرية بين الفئات العمرية من 0 إلى 19 عاماً متدنية. كما تشير بيانات أولية إضافية من دراسات الانتقال الأسري في الصين إلى أن الأطفال هم من يصابون بالعدوى من الكبار وليس العكس.وفي حين يتشابه طيف الأعراض التي يسببها الفيروسان، فإن نسبة المرض الوخيم تبدو مختلفة. فبالنسبة لفيروس كوفيد-19، تشير البيانات إلى أن 80 في المائة من حالات العدوى إما خفيفة أو عديمة الأعراض، في حين أن 15 في المائة منها وخيمة وتتطلب التزويد بالأكسجين، و5 في المائة منها حرجة وتتطلب التهوية. وهذه النسب من الإصابة بالعدوى الوخيمة والحرجة أعلى مما هو ملحوظ في حالات العدوى بالإنفلونزا.وتشمل الفئات الأكثر عرضةً لخطر الإصابة بعدوى الإنفلونزا الوخيمة الأطفال والحوامل والمسنّين والمصابين بمشاكل طبية أخرى مزمنة أو بالكبت المناعي. أما بالنسبة لكوفيد-19، فيشير الفهم الحالي إلى ازدياد مخاطر الإصابة بمرض وخيم مع تقدم السن ووجود أمراض أخرى متلازمة.ويبدو أن معدل الوفيات الناجمة عن الإصابة بكوفيد-19 أعلى من معدل الوفيات المرتبطة بالإنفلونزا، لا سيما الإنفلونزا الموسمية. وفي حين لن يتسنى استيعاب معدل الوفيات الحقيقي لفيروس كوفيد-19 بشكل كامل قبل مرور فترة من الزمن، فإن البيانات المتاحة لدينا حتى الآن تشير إلى أن معدل الوفيات الخام (أي عدد الوفيات المبلغ عنها مقسوماً على عدد الحالات المبلغ عنها) يتراوح بين 3 إلى 4 في المائة، أما معدل الوفيات بالعدوى (أي عدد الوفيات المبلغ عنها مقسوماً على عدد العداوى الفعلية) فسيكون أقل من ذلك. وبالمقابل فإن معدّل الوفيات بالنسبة للإنفلونزا الموسمية أقل بكثير من 0.1 في المائة. غير أن الوفيات ترتبط إلى حد كبير بالحصول على الرعاية الطبية وجودتها.
ما هي التدخلات الطبية المتاحة لكل من فيروس كوفيد-19 وفيروس الإنفلونزا؟,في حين أن هناك عدداً من العلاجات قيد التجارب السريرية حالياً في الصين وأكثر من 20 لقاحاً يجري تطويرها ضد فيروس كوفيد-19، فلا توجد حالياً أي لقاحات أو علاجات مرخصة لكوفيد-19. وبالمقابل، تتوفر مضادات فيروسات ولقاحات ضد الإنفلونزا. ورغم أن لقاح الإنفلونزا ليس فعالاً ضد فيروس كوفيد-19، يوصى بشدة بأخذ هذا اللقاح كل عام للوقاية من الإصابة بعدوى الإنفلونزا.
什么是冠状病毒？,冠状病毒是可以导致动物或人类疾病的一个大型病毒家族。一些冠状病毒已知可引起人类感冒以及中东呼吸综合征（MERS）和严重急性呼吸综合征（SARS）等较严重疾病。最近发现的新型冠状病毒是造成2019冠状病毒病的病原体。有关冠状病毒的全面信息
什么是2019冠状病毒病？,2019冠状病毒病是由最近发现的新型冠状病毒引起的传染病。在2019年12月中国武汉暴发疫情之前，未发现这一新型病毒和疾病。
2019冠状病毒病有何症状？,2019冠状病毒病最常见症状是发热、乏力和干咳。有些患者可能会有疼痛、鼻塞、流涕、咽痛或腹泻等症状。这些症状往往轻微，且逐渐出现。有些感染者并无任何症状，也无不适感。大多数感染者（约80%）无需特别治疗即可康复。大约六分之一感染者病情严重，呼吸困难。老人以及那些有基础性疾病（如高血压、心脏病或糖尿病）的人可能会患严重疾病。发热、咳嗽和呼吸困难者应就医。
2019冠状病毒病如何传播？,人们可以从其他感染者那里感染该病毒。2019冠状病毒病可以通过患者咳嗽或呼气时鼻或口产生的飞沫在人与人之间传播。这些飞沫掉落在患者周围的物体和表面上。其他人触摸这些物体或表面后触摸本人眼、鼻或口，就有可能患上2019冠状病毒病。如果吸入感染者咳嗽或呼气时产生的飞沫，也可能会感染病毒。因此，与患者保持1米（3英尺）以上的距离很重要。世卫组织正在评估目前关于2019冠状病毒病传播方式的研究，并将继续分享最新研究结果。该病毒能通过空气传播吗？迄今的研究结果显示，该病毒主要通过呼吸道飞沫传播，而不是通过空气传播。参见上面对“2019冠状病毒病如何传播？”问题的答复。无症状感染者是否也可以传播2019冠状病毒病？这一疾病主要通过咳嗽者的呼吸道飞沫传播。从没有任何症状的人那里感染2019冠状病毒病的风险很低。但2019冠状病毒病的许多患者仅有轻微症状，在发病早期尤其如此。因此，从轻微咳嗽且并未感到不适的人那里感染2019冠状病毒病是可能的。世卫组织正在评估目前关于2019冠状病毒病传染期的研究，并将继续分享最新研究结果。2019冠状病毒病会粪口传播吗？从感染者粪便中感染2019冠状病毒病的风险似乎很低。尽管初步调查表明在某些情况下该病毒可能存于粪便中，但粪口传播并非本次疫情的主要传播途径。世卫组织正在评估目前关于2019冠状病毒病传播方式的研究，并将继续分享新的研究结果。考虑到有此风险，更应在便后和饭前勤洗手。
我能做些什么保护自己并防止疾病传播？,适用于每个人的防护措施请随时关注世卫组织网站上以及国家和地方公共卫生机构提供的关于COVID-19疫情的最新信息。世界许多国家都发现了COVID-19病例，且若干国家出现了疫情。中国和其他一些国家的主管部门已经成功地减缓或阻止了疫情的蔓延。然而，情况是不可预测的，因此请定期查看最新信息。您可通过采取一些简单的防范措施，降低自己感染或传播COVID-19的几率：经常用含酒精成分的免洗洗手液或用肥皂和清水认真洗手。理由：用肥皂和清水或用含酒精成分的免洗洗手液洗手可以杀灭手上的病毒。与咳嗽或打喷嚏的人保持至少1米（3英尺）的距离。理由：人咳嗽或打喷嚏时，鼻或口会喷出可能含有病毒的飞沫。如果您离得太近，而咳嗽或打喷嚏者已感染了病毒，您就可能会吸入飞沫和病毒。避免触摸眼、鼻、口理由：手接触许多物品的表面，可能会沾上病毒。已被病毒污染的手可能会将病毒传至眼、鼻或口，病毒就会趁虚而入进入体内并引发疾病。应确保自己及周围的人保持良好的呼吸卫生习惯。打喷嚏或咳嗽时，需用弯曲的肘部遮挡口鼻，或用纸巾并立即妥善处置用过的纸巾。理由：飞沫会传播病毒。应保持良好的呼吸卫生习惯，保护周围的人免受普通感冒、流感和新型冠状病毒等病毒侵害。如果感觉不适，就应居家静养。如果发热、咳嗽或呼吸困难，应求医并预先打电话。应遵循当地卫生部门的指示。理由：国家和地方主管部门掌握您所在地区的最新情况。预先打电话可以使医务人员快速指导您与适当医疗机构联络。这也有助于保护您，并有助于防止传播病毒和其他感染。随时了解2019冠状病毒病的最新动态。遵循医务人员、国家和地方公共卫生部门或雇主提供的关于您自己和他人如何防范2019冠状病毒病的建议。理由：国家和地方主管部门掌握2019冠状病毒病是否在您所在地区传播的最新信息。它们最有资格建议您所在地区的居民如何进行自我防护。及时了解COVID-19的最新热点（即当前存在COVID-19广泛传播的城市或地区）。如可能，避免前往这些地方——尤其是老年人或糖尿病、心脏病或肺病患者。理由：在这些地方，感染COVID-19的几率更高。 针对身在或最近（过去14天）去过目前存在COVID-19传播地区的人员的保护措施遵循上述指导（适用于每个人的防护措施）如果开始感到不适，即使是轻微症状，如头痛、低烧（37.3摄氏度或以上）和有点流鼻涕，也要呆在家中，直到康复。如果必须请人上门送补给品或自己必须出去买食品等，请佩戴口罩以避免传染给其他人。理由：避免与他人接触和避免去医疗机构有助于医疗机构更有效运作，并有助于保护您和他人免受新型冠状病毒和其他病毒的侵害。如果发热、咳嗽和呼吸困难，这可能是呼吸道感染或其他严重疾病所致，因此应迅速就医。请预先打电话并告知医务人员您最近的任何旅行史或与旅行者接触史。理由：预先打电话可以使医务人员快速指导您与适当医疗机构联络。这也有助于防止传播2019冠状病毒病和其他病毒。
我患COVID-19的可能性有多大？,风险取决于你在哪里，更具体地说，取决于你所在的地方是否正暴发COVID-19疫情。对于大多数地方的大多数人而言，感染COVID-19的风险仍然很低。然而，目前该疾病正在世界各地的一些城市或地区传播。对于在这些地区生活或访问的人而言，感染COVID-19的风险更高。每当识别新的COVID-19病例时，政府和卫生主管部门都会采取有力措施。务必遵守当地对旅行、活动或大型集会的任何限制。配合疾病控制工作将可降低感染或传播COVID-19的风险。我们在中国和其他一些国家已经看到，COVID-19疫情可以得到控制，并且可以遏制其传播。不幸的是，可能会迅速出现新的疫情。因此，必须要了解你所在或打算去的地方的情况。世卫组织每天公布世界各地COVID-19的最新情况。请查看https://www.who.int/ emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/。
我应该对COVID-19感到担忧吗？,由COVID-19感染引起的病症通常是轻微的，尤其是对于儿童和年轻人。然而，也会导致严重病症：大约五分之一的感染者需要住院护理。因此，人们对COVID-19疫情会如何影响自己及亲人感到担忧很正常。我们可以将担忧转化为保护自己、保护亲人和社区的行动。这些行动中最重要的就是经常彻底洗手和保持良好的呼吸卫生习惯。其次，要随时了解情况并遵循当地卫生主管部门的建议，包括对旅行、活动和集会的任何限制。关于如何保护自己的更多信息，请访问：https://www.who.int/zh/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public。
谁有患重症的危险？,我们仍需要进一步了解2019冠状病毒病对各种人群的影响情况，但老年人和有基础病症（如高血压、心脏病、肺部疾病、癌症和糖尿病）的人似乎发展成重症的风险较高。
抗生素能有效预防和治疗2019冠状病毒病吗？,不能。抗生素对病毒不起作用，只对细菌感染有作用。2019冠状病毒病由病毒导致，因此，使用抗生素并无效果。不应使用抗生素预防或治疗2019冠状病毒病。只有在按医嘱治疗细菌感染的情况下才应使用抗生素。
是否有可用来预防或治愈COVID-19的药物或疗法？,尽管有一些西药、传统药物或家庭自创的治疗方法可使病人感到舒适并减轻COVID-19症状，但是尚无证据表明这些药物可以预防或治愈COVID-19。世卫组织也不建议自行使用包括抗生素在内的任何药物来预防或治疗COVID-19。不过，目前已有几种西药和传统药物进入临床试验。世卫组织将持续更新这方面的信息。
有预防2019冠状病毒病的疫苗或对症药物或疗法吗？,没有。目前还没有疫苗以及可预防或治疗2019冠状病毒病的任何特效抗病毒药物。但感染者应接受治疗，以缓解症状。重症患者应住院治疗。多数患者在接受支持性治疗后康复。正在研究疫苗和一些特异药物疗法，并通过临床试验予以测试。世卫组织正协调疫苗和药物开发工作，以预防和治疗2019冠状病毒病。针对2019冠状病毒病，保护自己和他人的最有效方法是勤洗手，咳嗽时用肘部或纸巾遮掩口鼻，并与咳嗽或打喷嚏的人保持至少1米（3英尺）的距离（见“我能做些什么保护自己和防止疾病传播？”）。
COVID-19与SARS一样吗？,不一样。导致COVID-19的病毒与严重急性呼吸综合征（SARS）病毒在基因上有关联，但并非同一种病毒。与COVID-19相比，SARS病死率较高，但传染性则低得多。自2003年以来，在世界上任何地方均未发生SARS疫情。
我应该戴口罩保护自己吗？,只有在出现COVID-19症状（尤其是咳嗽）或照顾可能感染COVID-19的人时，才需要戴口罩。一次性口罩只能使用一次。如果未生病或未在照顾病人，那么戴口罩便是浪费。目前世界各地都短缺口罩，世卫组织促请人们明智地使用口罩。世卫组织建议合理使用医用口罩，避免不必要浪费宝贵资源，并避免错误使用口罩（见口罩使用建议）。针对COVID-19，保护自己和他人的最有效方法是勤洗手，咳嗽时用肘部或纸巾遮掩口鼻，并与咳嗽或打喷嚏的人保持至少1米（3英尺）的距离。更多信息见针对新型冠状病毒的基本防护措施。
如何佩戴、使用、取下和处置口罩,请记住，口罩只应由医务人员、护理人员和有发热和咳嗽等呼吸道症状的人使用。在拿口罩前，用含酒精成分的免洗洗手液或用肥皂和清水洗手。拿起口罩，检查有无撕裂或破损。确定哪一边向上（有金属片的一边向上）。看清口罩正反面，口罩深色面朝外。将口罩戴在脸上。捏紧金属鼻夹或口罩硬边，使其贴紧鼻子。下拉口罩底部，使口罩覆盖口和下颌。使用后取下口罩；从耳后移除线绳，取下口罩后，注意不让口罩触碰脸部和衣服，以免接触可能被污染的口罩表面。用后立即将口罩丢进封闭的垃圾桶。触摸或丢弃口罩后，采取手卫生措施。使用含酒精成分的免洗洗手液洗手，如果手明显脏污，则用肥皂和清水洗手。
2019冠状病毒病潜伏期有多长？,潜伏期指从感染病毒到开始出现疾病症状之间的时间。多数估计2019冠状病毒病潜伏期为1-14天，通常为5天左右。在获得进一步数据后，将对这些估计数进行调整。
人会从动物那里感染2019冠状病毒病吗？,冠状病毒是一个大型病毒家族，常见于蝙蝠以及其他动物中。在偶尔情况下，人感染这些病毒后可能会将其传至他人。例如，SARS-CoV是从果子狸传播至人，MERS-CoV是从单峰骆驼传播至人。尚未查明2019冠状病毒病的动物源。为保护自己，例如在活体动物市场时，应避免直接接触动物以及动物触碰过的地方。应始终保持良好的卫生安全习惯。谨慎处理生鲜的肉、奶或动物器官，以免生食遭到污染。不要食用生鲜或未煮熟的动物产品。
我的宠物会传播COVID-19吗？,我们知道有COVID-19患者的动物和宠物受到感染；作为负责改善全球动物健康的政府间机构，世界动物卫生组织（国际兽疫局）正在为兽医机构和技术专家制定与动物健康相关的专题技术指导（包括检测和检疫指导）；一些动物有可能通过与被感染的人密切接触而受到感染。需要进一步证据来了解动物和宠物是否会传播该疾病；根据目前的证据，人际传播仍是主要传播渠道；现在说猫是否可能是传播COVID-19的中间宿主还为时过早。
该病毒在物体表面能存活多久？,目前仍不清楚该病毒在物体表面能存活多久，但该病毒的表现似乎和其他冠状病毒类似。研究结果表明，包括根据新型冠状病毒初步信息，冠状病毒可能会在物体表面存活数小时或数天。在不同条件下，例如在不同种类的物体表面以及不同的环境温度或湿度下，存活期可能会有所不同。如果您认为某一物体表面可能受到污染，可用简单消毒剂杀灭病毒，以保护自己和他人。使用含酒精成分的免洗洗手液或肥皂和清水洗手。不要触摸眼、鼻、口。
接收来自据报有2019冠状病毒病疫情的任何地区的包裹安全吗？,是的。感染者导致商品污染的可能性很低。人们从经过不同环境和气温条件送达的包裹中感染新型冠状病毒的风险也很低。
我不该做哪些事情？,以下措施不能有效应对2019冠状病毒病，甚至可能有害：吸烟佩戴多个口罩服用抗生素（参见“是否有可用来预防或治愈COVID-19的药物或疗法？”）无论如何，如果有发热、咳嗽和呼吸困难等症状，请及早就医，以降低发生更严重感染的风险，并应告知医务人员您最近的旅行史。
引起COVID-19的冠状病毒的来源是已知的吗？,目前，引起COVID-19的冠状病毒SARS-CoV-2的来源尚不清楚。所有现有证据表明，SARS-CoV-2有一个天然的动物来源，而不是一个构建的病毒。蝙蝠很可能是SARS-CoV-2病毒的天然贮主。SARS-CoV-2属于一类基因相关病毒，其中也包括SARS-CoV和从蝙蝠种群中分离出来的许多其它冠状病毒。MERS-CoV也属于这一类，但关系不那么密切。
第一例人感染SARS-CoV-2是如何发生的？,2019年12月，在中国武汉市第一次发现了人类COVID-19病例。在现阶段还不可能准确地确定在中国的人最初是如何感染SARS-CoV-2的。然而，导致2003年SARS暴发的病毒SARS-CoV从一个动物贮主（一种人工饲养的野生动物——果子狸）传染给人类，然后在人与人之间传播。以类似的方式，人们认为SARS-CoV-2越过了物种屏障，首先感染了人类，但更有可能是通过一个中间宿主，即另一个更有可能被人类接触的动物物种——这有可能是一种家养动物、一种野生动物或一种驯养的野生动物，目前还没有定论。在查明并控制这种病毒的来源之前，存在这种病毒被重新引入人类群体的风险，以及暴发新疫情的风险，就像我们目前正在经历的疫情一样。
COVID-19可以通过空气传播吗？,导致COVID-19的病毒主要通过感染者咳嗽、打喷嚏或说话时产生的飞沫传播。这些飞沫太重，无法悬浮在空气中，很快就会落在地板或各种表面上。如果你与COVID-19患者相距1米以内，你可能会因为吸入病毒而被感染，或者因为在洗手前触摸了一个被污染的表面，然后又触摸自己的眼睛、鼻子或嘴巴而被感染。
多大规模的会议或活动算是“大型集会”？,像奥运会或世界杯这样引人注目的国际体育赛事以及像麦加朝圣这样的国际宗教活动算是大型集会。然而，不那么引人注目的会议和活动也可能符合世卫组织对大型集会的定义。如果一项活动所汇集的人多到有可能造成活动所在社区卫生系统的规划和应对资源紧张，那么这项活动就被视为“大型集会”。你需要考虑活动的举办地点和持续时间以及参与者人数。例如，如果在一个卫生系统能力相当有限的小岛屿国家举行为期几天的活动，那么即使只有几千人参加也会给卫生系统带来很大压力，因此该活动被认为是“大型集会”。相反，如果活动是在一个拥有资源充足的大型卫生系统的国家的大城市举行，并且仅持续几个小时，则该活动可能不构成“大型集会”。
世卫组织是否建议因COVID-19而取消所有国际大型集会？,不。由于国际大型集会各不相同，因此在决定是否取消活动时要考虑的因素也可能不同。任何改变计划中的国际集会的决定都应该基于对风险和如何管理风险的仔细评估，以及活动策划的水平。评估应涉及活动的所有利益攸关方，尤其是活动举办地所在国家或社区的卫生主管部门。这些主管部门和利益攸关方最有资格评估活动可能给当地卫生系统和应急服务带来的压力水平，以及这种压力水平在当前情况下是否可以接受。
在评估风险是否可接受时，组织者和卫生主管部门应该考虑哪些因素？,就目前并非已知存在COVID-19社区传播的国家而言，重点考虑的是计划中的大型集会活动是否会大大增加病毒进入该国并持续存在的风险，以及参与者带着该传染病回国并进一步加剧全球传播的风险。在进行这一评估时，组织者及其国家或地方卫生主管部门应认识到COVID-19输入病例的风险自然与国际旅行有关。他们还应该认识到，以零风险为目标既不现实也不可取。在组织者和卫生主管部门决定是否举行大型集会时，他们应该确定可接受的风险是什么，以及应该采取哪些额外措施来降低风险。就COVID-19已经开始在社区传播的国家而言，主要考虑因素是：旨在遏制或至少减缓病毒在当地社区/国家的传播。防止来自其它国家的参与者感染COVID-19。在不同情况下，应根据COVID-19的已知特征、严重性、传播性以及预防或减少传播措施的有效性来考虑风险。还需要考虑应对COVID-19疫情已经给地方卫生系统带来的压力，以及大型集会可能给系统带来的额外压力。你可以在2020年2月14日在本次COVID-19疫情的背景下发布的世卫组织文件《大型集会的主要规划建议》中找到更多的建议：https://www.who.int/publications-detail/key-planning-recommendations-for-mass-gatherings-in-the-context-of-the-current-covid-19-outbreak。
如果我所在的组织不具备评估COVID-19给我们计划的大型集会带来的风险的专长，该怎么办？,你计划举行的大型集会所在地的国家和地方公共卫生主管部门很可能知道如何进行卫生风险评估。如果那里有世卫组织国家办事处，他们也可以提供一些专家支持。你所在地区的世卫组织区域办事处也可能提供这方面的支持。你可以在以下网址找到世卫组织区域办事处的名称和联系方式：https://www.who.int/zh/about/who-we-are/regional-offices。
如果我们继续举行国际大型集会，我们能做些什么来降低参与者感染COVID-19的风险？,宣传洗手、呼吸卫生和保持社交距离。确保你知晓所有参与者的紧急联系方式，包括他们在活动期间的住处。你应该向他们明确表示，如果有活动参与者感染了COVID-19，此信息将与当地公共卫生主管部门共享，以便能够快速追踪接触者。活动组织者需要有一个商定的防范计划，以防一个或多个参与者出现COVID-19症状。防范计划应包括迅速隔离病人，并将他们安全转移到当地的医疗机构。你应该考虑是否可以减少活动参与者的人数；提供通过视频或电话会议参与活动的机会；以及可能的话在入场时对参与者进行COVID-19症状（咳嗽、发烧、不适）筛查。你可以在以下网址找到关于参与者个人如何保护他们自己和他们所爱的人免受COVID-19侵害的建议：https://www.who.int/zh/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public。
我在哪里可以找到更多关于评估和管理国际大型集会的卫生风险的建议？,世卫组织就如何规划大型集会提供了指导和培训课程。指导和课程都着眼于如何与地方主管部门合作进行风险评估、规划和管理卫生风险：https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/points-of-entry-and-mass-gatherings。你可以在以下网址找到可提供给参与者个人的关于如何保护他们自己以及他们所爱的人免受COVID-19侵害的建议：https://www.who.int/zh/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public。
如何清洁2019冠状病毒病患者的脏被褥、毛巾和衣服？,处理2019冠状病毒病患者的脏被褥、毛巾和衣服的所有人员应该注意以下事项： 在接触上述任何脏污用品之前，应穿戴适当的个人防护装备，包括坚实的手套、口罩、眼睛保护装置（面罩/护目镜）、长袖罩衣、围裙（如果罩衣不耐液体）、靴子或密闭的鞋子。不要贴身拿这些脏污用品；将这些用品放在有清晰标记的不漏的容器（如袋子或桶）中。如果这些用品上有任何粪便或呕吐物等固体排泄物，在将这些用品放入专用容器之前，需用平坦、坚固的器具小心地将排泄物刮到马桶或专用厕所中。如果患者房间并无厕所，则需将刮下的排泄物放入带盖的桶里，然后拿到厕所里处理掉。洗涤和消毒这些用品：建议使用洗衣机，用温水（60-90℃）和洗涤剂进行洗涤，以清洁和消毒这些用品。如果不能用洗衣机洗，可用大桶将它们浸泡在热肥皂水中，然后用棍子搅拌，但应注意不要拍打和溅水。如果没有热水，则可将它们浸泡在0.05%的含氯漂白剂中约30分钟。最后，需用清水冲洗，然后晾在阳光下晒干。 关于环境清洁最佳做法的更多信息，见以下两份英文文件：(1) 在卫生保健设施中预防和控制易流行和易大流行的急性呼吸道感染：https://www.who.int/csr/bioriskreduction/infection_control/publication/en/(2) 在资源有限环境下卫生保健设施中清洁环境的最佳做法：https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/resource-limited/environmental-cleaning-508.pdf 。由美国疾病预防控制中心和免疫成本计算行动网络（ICAN）与世卫组织合作开发。
对于来自中国或其他受到2019冠状病毒病影响的国家的车辆、货物和产品的消毒工作有何建议？,迄今为止，没有任何流行病学信息表明，有人曾因接触来自2019冠状病毒病疫情国家的货物、产品或车辆而患2019冠状病毒病。鉴于并无证据表明来自存在2019冠状病毒病疫情的国家的任何商品和产品对公众健康构成风险，我们没有关于如何对这些产品进行消毒的建议。世卫组织将继续密切监测2019冠状病毒病的演变，并将根据需要更新相关建议。
采集2019冠状病毒病疑似或确诊患者鼻咽或口咽拭子样本的医护人员应该使用什么样的个人防护装备？,采集2019冠状病毒病疑似或确诊患者鼻咽或口咽拭子样本的医护人员应训练有素，熟悉规程，并应穿着干净但非无菌的长袖罩衣、医用口罩、护眼装置（即护目镜或面罩）和手套。采集样本应在单独/隔离的房间中进行。在采集鼻咽拭子样本时，医护人员应要求患者戴上医用口罩或用纸巾遮口。采集鼻咽或口咽拭子样本有可能引起患者咳嗽，但目前没有证据表明采集鼻咽或口咽拭子样本时引起的咳嗽会加剧通过气溶胶传播2019冠状病毒病的风险。
血站是否应该常规筛查血液制品中有无COVID-19病毒？,不应该。尽管在有症状的2019冠状病毒病患者血液中检测到SARS-CoV-2的核糖核酸片段，但这并不意味着所检出的病毒有存续力或有传染性。一般而言，没有证据显示呼吸道病毒会通过输血传播。但血站应采取常规献血筛查措施，以防有呼吸系统症状或发烧的人献血。作为预防措施，血站可以鼓励那些在过去14天内有在存在COVID-19疫情的国家旅行史的人或已被确诊患2019冠状病毒病的人或与2019冠状病毒病确诊病例有密切接触的人自行推迟献血。
医护人员在治疗和护理2019-nCoV疑似或确诊患者时，是否需要穿防护靴、医用围裙或连体防护服等常规个人防护装备？,不需要。世卫组织目前对2019-nCoV急性呼吸道疾病疑似或确诊患者的医护人员的指导意见是，除了所有医护人员针对所有患者应始终采取的标准防护措施之外，还建议采用预防接触感染和飞沫感染措施。关于个人防护装备，接触和飞沫传播预防措施包括，在进入收治2019-nCoV急性呼吸道疾病疑似或确诊患者病房之前，应佩戴一次性手套保护双手，穿戴清洁、非无菌的长袖袍服保护衣物免受污染，佩戴医用口罩保护口鼻，并戴上眼部防护装置（如护目镜和防护面罩）。N95等呼吸器仅适用于产生气溶胶的操作程序。更多有关医护人员治疗和护理新型冠状病毒疑似或确诊患者的个人防护装备的信息
一次性医用口罩可以消毒和重复使用吗？,不可以。一次性医用口罩只能一次性使用。用后，应妥善取下口罩（不触摸正面，从后面通过两端皮筋或线绳取下口罩），并立即丢入带盖的传染性材料垃圾桶，然后采取手卫生措施。关于新型冠状病毒疫情期间使用口罩的更多信息 - 英文
为什么世卫组织建议2019-nCoV疑似和确诊患者的医护人员采取接触和飞沫传播预防措施，而不是采用常规空气传播预防措施？,国际专家审查了2019-nCoV传播模式的现有证据并得出共识。世卫组织根据国际专家的共识制定了快速指导方针。现有证据表明此病毒通过飞沫传播，并通过接触受污染的设备表面而传播。现有证据显示通常不会通过空气传播。其他病毒性呼吸道疾病显示，在产生气溶胶的操作（例如气管插管和支气管镜检查）中，可能会发生空气传播，因此世卫组织建议对这些操作程序采取空气传播预防措施。关于2019-nCoV疫情医护人员防护的更多信息
世卫组织是否建议身体健康的人在2019-nCoV疫情期间通常佩戴口罩？,不，世卫组织不建议社区中无症状的个人（即没有呼吸道症状的人）佩戴医用口罩，因为目前没有证据表明健康的人通常使用医用口罩可以预防2019-nCoV传播。建议社区中有症状的人佩戴口罩。医用口罩的误用和滥用可能会导致严重的库存短缺问题，造成那些真正需要佩戴口罩的人反而无法获得口罩。在医护人员直接治疗和护理2019-nCoV急性呼吸道疾病疑似或确诊患者的医疗机构中，口罩是遏制2019-nCoV人际传播的重要工具，同时也应使用其他个人防护装备并采取手部卫生措施。关于医用口罩使用的更多信息 - 英文
新型冠状病毒疑似和确诊患者可住在同一间病房吗？,2019-nCoV急性呼吸道疾病疑似和确诊患者最好应单间隔离。如果这不可行（例如单人病房数量有限），也可以合住。一些2019-nCoV的疑似患者实际上可能还患有其他呼吸系统疾病，因此必须将他们与2019-nCoV确诊患者隔离开。病床之间应始终保持至少1米距离。
2019-nCoV疑似或确诊患者如果症状轻微，是否需要住院治疗？,不需要。轻症患者，例如低烧、咳嗽、不适、流涕、咽痛的患者，如果没有任何警示体征，如气短或呼吸困难、呼吸道症状恶化（有痰或咯血）、胃肠道症状（恶心、呕吐和/或腹泻等），且精神状态并无变化，在不担心发生临床症状快速恶化的情况下，可能不需要住院治疗。应告知所有居家休息的患者，如果病情恶化，即须到医院治疗。关于入院标准的更多信息 - 英文关于2019-nCoV轻症患者居家护理的信息
如果需要住院治疗，是否需要由专科医院或转诊医院收治2019-nCoV疑似或确诊患者？,不需要。世卫组织目前的建议是，并不要求必须由专科医院或转诊医院收治2019-nCoV急性呼吸道疾病疑似或确诊患者。但如果国家或地区认为这类医院最有可能安全收治2019-nCoV疑似或确诊患者，或者出于其他临床原因（例如需要有先进的生命支持设备），也可以选择仅由这类医院收治患者。无论如何，为保护患者、医护人员和探访者，任何收治2019-nCoV疑似或确诊患者的医疗机构均应遵循世卫组织关于医疗机构感染防控的建议。世卫组织关于医疗机构感染防控的建议
对于2019-nCoV疑似或确诊患者所在的医疗机构或住所，推荐使用哪些消毒剂对环境消毒？,在2019-nCoV疑似或确诊患者所处的医疗机构或住所中，应使用可以有效抑制2019-nCoV和其他冠状病毒等包膜病毒的消毒剂对环境消毒。许多消毒剂（例如常用的医院消毒剂）对包膜病毒有抑制作用。世卫组织目前建议：用70%医用酒精对可以重复使用的专用设备(如温度计) 进行消毒。用0.5%（相当于5000ppm）的次氯酸钠对家中或医疗机构中经常接触的表面进行消毒。2019-nCoV疫情期间医疗机构指导方针 - 英文医疗机构的感染预防和控制
2019-nCoV能在干燥的物体表面存活多久？,目前没有关于2019-nCoV在物体表面稳定性的数据。从实验室对SARS-CoV和MERS-CoV的研究数据来看，环境稳定性取决于相对温度、湿度和表面类型等若干因素。世卫组织继续监测关于新型冠状病毒的现有证据，并将在获得相关证据后予以更新。
是否有处置2019-nCoV疑似或确诊患者产生的医疗废物的特别程序？,没有。在2019-nCoV疑似或确诊患者的医护环境中或居家护理过程中产生的医疗废物应作为传染性医疗废物予以处置。关于处置传染性医疗废物的更多信息 - 英文
是否有管理2019-nCoV尸体的特别程序？,没有关于管理2019-nCoV尸体的特别程序。有关部门和医疗机构应继续执行其现有的关于传染病患者死后管理的政策和法规。
是否有隔离病房的设置模式、类型、产品和健康要求？,目前正开发隔离病房设置模式。关于新型冠状病毒患者的医护人员的个人防护装备规格，见疾病用品包（英文）。
也可以使用含氯溶液吗？,强烈建议不要使用含氯溶液，因为制作和稀释含氯溶液会带来刺激手和不良健康影响（例如刺激眼睛和引起呼吸问题）的较高风险。此外，如果暴露在阳光下或受热，含氯溶液可能会丧失抗病毒效果。训练有素的人员才能制备达到0.05%正确剂量的含氯溶液。私营部门制作的漂白剂浓度不一。含氯溶液必须每天配置，即使在盖紧容器后存于背光阴凉干燥处也是如此。而简单的肥皂水溶液则无任何上述健康风险和不良后果，不会因受热或阳光照射而丧失抗病毒效果。肥皂水抗病毒作用的原理是，肥皂可以溶解冠状病毒的表面脂肪包膜，进而杀灭病毒。
何为身体活动？,身体活动包括各种形式的主动康乐活动、参加体育活动、骑车和步行以及工作时和在家及花园四周所做的各种活动。不必非得是锻炼或体育活动——玩耍、跳舞、园艺，甚至打扫房间和进行繁重购物都是身体活动的组成部分。在COVID-19大流行期间，我们中的许多人行动极其受限，各年龄段不同能力的人尽可能坚持活动更加重要。久坐之后歇息片刻，做3-5分钟的身体活动（如步行或拉伸活动），也有助于舒缓肌肉劳损、缓解精神紧张并改善血液循环和肌肉活动。有规律的身体活动也有助于每日有一个例行活动，并成为与家人和朋友保持联系的一种方式。
为什么需要身体活动？,有规律的身体活动有益于身心健康，可以降低高血压，有助于控制体重并降低患心脏病、中风、II型糖尿病和各种癌症的患病风险，还可以增强骨骼和肌肉力量，并提高平衡、柔韧和健美程度。对于老年人而言，改善平衡的活动有助于防止跌倒和受伤。对于儿童而言，有规律的身体活动有助于健康成长和发育，并减少晚年患病的风险，通过有规律的活动，儿童也可以发展基本的运动技能并建立社交关系。有规律的身体活动还有助于精神健康，并可以降低患上抑郁症和认知能力下降的风险，能够延缓痴呆症的形成——并提高整体幸福感。
建议多大的身体活动量？,世卫组织就各个年龄段应采取的有益于其健康与幸福感的身体活动量提出了详细建议（5岁以下儿童；青少年、成年人和老年人）。以下是我们推荐的最低活动量：一岁以下婴儿需要每天进行几次身体活动。五岁以下儿童每天应至少花180分钟时间做身体活动，3-4岁儿童每天应做1个小时的中等或剧烈活动。5-17岁的儿童和青少年所有儿童和青少年应每周至少3天每天至少花60分钟时间做中度到剧烈的身体活动，包括增强肌肉和骨骼力量的身体活动。18岁以上成年人一星期应当至少共花150分钟时间做中度身体活动，或者一星期至少花75分钟时间做剧烈的身体活动，包括每星期两天或更多天做增强肌肉力量活动。行动不便的老年人应当每星期三天或更多天做身体活动，以增强平衡并防止摔倒。但是，做任何身体活动都比不做强。从少量活动开始，随着时间逐渐增加持续时间、频率和强度。在COVID-19大流行期间坚持活动对我们所有人而言都具有挑战性。由于活动身体的机会似乎更加受限，因此每天规划坚持活动的方式并减少久坐时间甚至更加重要。简而言之，在这关键时期要确保我们所有人多动少坐。
在COVID-19疫情期间如何在锻炼时保证自己的安全？,如果发烧、咳嗽和呼吸困难，请不要锻炼。待在家里休息，主动就医并提前打电话。请遵从当地卫生部门的指示。 如果能够外出散步或骑车，时刻注意保持身体距离，在离开前、到达目的地和回家后立即用水和肥皂洗手。如果身旁无水和肥皂可用，请使用含酒精成分的免洗洗手液。如果去公园或公共开放空间散步、跑步或锻炼，时刻注意保持身体距离，并在离开前、到达目的地和回家后立即用水和肥皂洗手。如果身旁无水和肥皂可用，请使用含酒精成分的免洗洗手液。关于对同行人数的任何限制和/或对使用公共户外游乐设施或健身器材的限制，请遵从当地卫生部门的指示。如果没有固定的活动，则慢慢来并从低强度活动开始，例如步行和低冲击锻炼。一开始时间短些，比如5至10分钟，用几周时间逐渐延长到30分钟或更长时间。与不习惯却要做长时间活动相比，更频繁地做短时间活动会更有益、更安全。选择适当的活动，以便减少受伤的风险并享受这项活动。根据健康状况和健壮程度选择合适的强度。在做轻度和中度身体活动时，应该能够呼吸自如并进行交谈。
如何在家中和四周坚持活动？,尽量减少久坐时间，无论是上班、学习、看电视、看书、使用社交媒体还是使用屏幕打游戏。每隔20-30分钟休息3-5分钟，减少久坐不起。只需站起来伸展一下身体即可，在房子周围走走、爬爬楼梯或到花园走走则更好。只要四处走动并伸展一下身体，就可以改善健康状况并提高幸福感。有关健康伸展运动的更多思路和插图 - 英文。制订有规律的作息，每日坚持活动，规划自己的身体活动或锻炼时间，参加线上课程或与朋友或同事进行积极的在线互动。安排具体时间坚持活动，有助于保证完成每日的身体活动。把时间安排记在日记里，这有助于提醒你。坚持不放弃，因为这将有助于形成有规律的作息，并在COVID-19疫情期间受到各种限制的情况下帮助适应新的工作、学习和家庭生活方式。与家人和朋友积极互动，与他人建立联系有助于个人和家人在家中及其他地方共度时光并坚持活动。安排时间与孩子一起在家中玩游戏、在公园里散步或骑车，这可能是全家人在居家期间放松、待在一起、保持积极健康的一种方式。  确定自己和家人坚持活动的目标，选择一种特定类型活动、每日的活动时间和/或每天活动多少分钟。让每位家庭成员选择自己的目标，这会提出不小的挑战，但在家人或朋友帮助下、在动力驱动下则是切合实际的。在每周活动图表上记一下进度，如果认为有帮助，请用自己喜爱的东西奖励一下自己。更多的身体活动思路有助于坚持活动一岁以下婴儿花固定时间与家里的婴儿做地板游戏，让婴儿处于俯卧姿势（“俯卧时间”），并在婴儿清醒时全天随时进行这项活动。五岁以下儿童在家中和四周积极玩耍——发明一些需要活动同时可以发展投掷、接抓、踢蹬技能并且培养仪态和平衡能力的游戏。积极玩耍、积极做游戏，让孩子们大口喘气，例如四处奔跑和各种跳跃活动。5-17岁的儿童和青少年积极的游戏并与家人积极玩耍。参加线上的积极游戏或积极课程，并寻找适合青少年的线上体育课程以及规律运动。安排室内场地游戏（例如跳绳和跳房子）——制作新游戏并设计需要坚持活动的挑战。学习一项新技能——例如试着学一下玩杂耍。鼓励做一些增加肌肉力量训练活动，例如举重或即兴使用重物，例如装满水或沙子的瓶子。成人尽量多爬楼梯，将其视为坚持活动的机会。 将家务劳动作为增加身体活动的方式。抽时间找乐，例如随着音乐跳舞。参加线上锻炼课程，或设计自己喜欢的有配乐的固定动作，调动主要的肌肉群并提高心律。做一些增强肌肉力量的活动，例如举重或即兴举整瓶水，或者只是利用自己的身体重量，做几组俯卧撑、仰卧起坐和下蹲。 何处获得更多帮助和信息如需得到更多思路，请用互联网搜索平台并查看社交媒体以获得建议，并获取适合所有年龄儿童及成年人的免费资源，以便进行各种健身和能力增强活动。
有多少个受疟疾影响国家报告了COVID-19病例？,世卫组织所有区域的疟疾流行国家都报告了COVID-19病例。世卫组织非洲区域的疟疾负担占全球负担的90%以上，截至3月25日，该区域有37个国家报告了这种疾病的病例；其中有10个国家报告该病存在本地传播。关于COVID-19大流行的最新状况报告可从世卫组织网站获取。
鉴于COVID-19在全球快速传播，是否应继续实施疟疾病媒控制核心干预措施？,最近几天有报告称，由于担心接触到COVID-19，若干非洲国家暂停了药浸蚊帐和室内残留喷洒运动。暂停此类运动将使许多弱势民众，特别是幼儿和孕妇面临更大的疟疾风险。世卫组织大力鼓励各国不要暂停规划或实施病媒控制活动，包括药浸蚊帐和室内残留喷洒运动，同时确保提供这些服务时采用保护卫生工作者和社区免受COVID-19感染的最佳实践。可能需要修改计划分发战略，以最大限度减少接触冠状病毒。预防疟疾联盟在应对COVID-19背景下就分发药浸蚊帐为国家疟疾控制规划提供了宝贵指导；这些建议与世卫组织的全球指导意见一致。为开展室内残留喷洒运动，世卫组织支持美国总统的疟疾倡议在COVID-19背景下提出的指导意见。除其他行动外，该指导意见建议室内残留喷洒部署小组：增加所有行动地点的洗手台和肥皂数量；加强对所有小组成员的早上健康检查，并在可行的情况下增加体温测量；进入行动地点之前戴好N-95口罩和个人防护装备；经常擦拭任何接触表面（门把手、车辆栏杆等）。除上述建议外，还应为普通民众提供世卫组织推荐的基本保护措施。
继续在撒哈拉以南非洲实施世卫组织推荐的预防性治疗吗？,是的，应继续实施怀孕期间间歇性预防治疗、季节性疟疾化学预防和婴儿间歇性预防性治疗，前提是采取最佳做法保护卫生工作者及其他一线工作人员免受COVID-19感染。确保获得这些工具和疟疾预防的其他核心工具可以挽救生命，是在应对COVID-19背景下减轻卫生系统所承受压力的重要战略。世卫组织新的指导意见介绍了在COVID-19背景下卫生工作者的权利、角色和责任。世卫组织还为各国制定了在大流行期间继续安全提供基本卫生服务的指导意见。
世卫组织关于疟疾诊断与治疗的指导意见是否有任何变化？,世卫组织的指导意见仍然不变。早诊断、早治疗对于防止疟疾轻症发展成重症或导致死亡至关重要。各国不应缩减发现和治疗疟疾工作；否则会严重损害数百万感染了可能危及生命的疾病的患者的健康和福祉。
在COVID-19背景下可能需要哪些额外特别措施？,除常规的疟疾控制办法外，在COVID-19大流行背景下可能还需要采取特别措施，例如暂时恢复假定性疟疾治疗或实施大型服药活动，事实证明这些措施在以前的一些紧急情况下是有益的。假定性疟疾治疗是指在没有诊断确诊（例如通过快速诊断检测）的情况下对疑似疟疾病例进行治疗。这种办法通常只用于极端情况，例如无法再提供快速诊断情况下的病例。大型服药活动是世卫组织推荐的办法，用于在流行期间和复杂的紧急情况下迅速降低疟疾死亡率和发病率。通过大型服药活动，目标人群中的所有个体，无论是否显示出这种疾病症状，都会得到抗疟疾药物——通常要重复服用。只有在认真考虑以下两个重要目标之后才可采取此类特别措施：降低与疟疾有关的死亡率和保证卫生工作者安全。世卫组织正在探讨何时以及如何启动此类措施的具体建议；指导意见将在适当时发布。
为什么世卫组织特别关注COVID-19在受疟疾影响地区扩散？,先前的经验表明，疾病暴发对卫生服务提供具有破坏性影响，并对疟疾等疾病产生了后果。例如，2014-2016年几内亚、利比里亚和塞拉利昂暴发埃博拉疫情破坏了疟疾控制工作，并导致这三个国家与疟疾有关的疾病和死亡人数大幅增长。最近几周，COVID-19大流行考验了全世界强大的卫生系统的韧性。世卫组织认识到疟疾给卫生系统脆弱国家的弱势民众带来了沉重负担，强调持续努力预防、发现和治疗疟疾的至关重要性。所有区域都应采取保护措施，以最大限度降低患者、社区和卫生服务提供者之间传播COVID-19的风险。世卫组织在应对COVID-19疫情暴发背景下制定了详细的卫生工作者指南，并为继续安全地提供基本卫生服务制定了业务指南。
正在致力于消除疟疾或防止传播重新出现的国家的主要考虑因素是什么？,上述所有考虑因素均适用于正在消除疟疾的国家和防止该疾病传播重新出现的国家：必须继续努力预防、发现和治疗疟疾病例，同时防止COVID-19传播并确保服务提供者的安全。即将消除疟疾的国家必须保护其重要成果并避免疟疾复发。已消除疟疾的国家必须对可能出现的任何输入性疟疾病例保持警惕，以防止该疾病再次输入。
COVID-19大流行是否导致与疟疾相关的主要商品的全球供应中断？,是的。最近几天有报告称，由于封锁和为应对COVID-19商品进出口暂停，防治疟疾基本商品（例如长效药浸蚊帐、快速诊断检测和抗疟疾药物）的供应链中断。需要采取协调行动确保疟疾控制关键工具的可得性，特别是在疾病高负担国家，并确保限制COVID-19传播的行动不会损害疟疾预防、诊断和治疗服务的获得。
在COVID-19疫情背景下世卫组织正采取哪些行动来支持受疟疾影响国家？,世卫组织正在本组织的三个层面上（国家、区域和总部）开展工作，以确保旨在预防冠状病毒传播并指导COVID-19疾病管理的任何建议适用于受疟疾影响国家。世卫组织与合作伙伴一起还确定了一系列相互关联的必要行动，以减轻COVID-19在受疟疾冲击最严重的国家的影响。本组织最近召集合作伙伴讨论合作与协调领域，目的是：产生、使用和传播准确的信息；减轻对卫生系统的干扰；确保针对疟疾的常规服务的连续性，在某些情况下还提供额外特别措施。世卫组织愿意与各国和其他利益攸关方合作，减轻冠状病毒对全世界应对疟疾的不利影响，并在可能的情况下为成功应对COVID-19做出贡献。
在应对COVID-19背景下世卫组织对使用氯喹和羟氯喹持何立场？,世卫组织正在积极关注针对COVID-19持续进行的临床试验，包括将氯喹及其衍生物羟氯喹用于治疗和/或预防的研究。目前尚无充足数据来评估这两种药物在治疗COVID-19患者或在预防感染冠状病毒方面的疗效。世卫组织目前推荐使用氯喹治疗间日疟。在应对COVID-19背景下目前正在研究的氯喹和羟氯喹剂量和治疗方案并非治疗疟疾患者所用的剂量和治疗方案。大剂量摄入这些药物可能会给健康带来不利的或严重不利的后果。对于突发公共卫生事件，世卫组织拥有系统而透明的研发流程，包括药物临床试验。2020年1月7日启动的世卫组织COVID-19“研发蓝图”旨在快速追踪可用于挽救生命并避免大规模危机的有效检测、疫苗和药物的可得性。世卫组织还设计了一套程序，以评估紧急情况下医疗技术的性能、质量和安全性。
艾滋病毒感染者感染COVID-19的风险更高吗？,"一般而言，处于疾病晚期的艾滋病毒感染者、CD4低和病毒载量高的艾滋病毒感染者以及未接受抗逆转录病毒治疗的艾滋病毒感染者的感染和相关并发症风险更高。尚不清楚艾滋病毒的免疫抑制是否会使人更容易感染COVID-19，因此，在了解更多情况之前，应该对所有晚期艾滋病毒感染者或艾滋病毒没有得到有效控制的感染者采取额外的预防措施[1],[2]。目前没有证据表明，在接受抗逆转录病毒治疗的临床和免疫稳定的艾滋病毒感染者中，COVID-19感染或并发症的风险与普通人群相比有所不同。一些艾滋病毒感染者可能有已知的COVID-19并发症的风险因素，如糖尿病、高血压及其它非传染性疾病，因此可能面临更高的与艾滋病毒无关的COVID-19风险。我们知道，在SARS和MERS疫情期间，艾滋病毒感染者中只有少数几个轻症病例的报告。迄今为止，已有一例艾滋病毒感染者患上COVID-19并康复的病例报告[3]，以及一项来自中国的关于风险因素和患COVID-19的艾滋病毒感染者中抗逆转录病毒药物的使用情况的小型研究。该研究报告说，与整个人群相比，COVID-19疾病的发生率相似，并且风险随年龄的增长而增高，但与CD4低、病毒载量高或抗逆转录病毒疗法无关[4]。目前的临床数据表明，主要的死亡风险因素与老年和其它共病相关，包括心血管疾病、糖尿病、慢性呼吸道疾病和高血压。一些非常健康的人也因冠状病毒感染而患上了严重的疾病[5]。建议艾滋病毒感染者采取与普通人群相同的预防措施[6],[7]： 经常洗手咳嗽礼仪保持身体距离有症状时就医如果与COVID-19感染者接触过，自我隔离，以及根据政府回应采取的其它行动 应确保正在服用抗逆转录病毒药物的艾滋病毒感染者至少30天、最多6个月的药品供应，并确保他们最近接种了疫苗（流感和肺炎球菌疫苗）。还应确保提供足够的药物来治疗合并感染、共病和成瘾。"
抗逆转录病毒药物可用于治疗COVID-19吗？,几项研究表明，感染导致COVID-19的病毒以及相关的冠状病毒（SARS-CoV和MERS-CoV）的患者具有良好的临床结果，几乎所有病例都完全康复了。在某些情况下向患者提供了抗逆转录病毒药物：用利托那韦增强的洛匹那韦（LPV/r）。这些研究大多是在艾滋病毒阴性个体中进行的。值得注意的是，这些使用LPV/r的研究有很大的局限性。研究规模较小，治疗的时机、持续的时间和使用的剂量各不相同，大多数患者接受的联合干预/联合治疗可能有助于所报告的结果。对于用抗逆转录病毒药物治疗冠状病毒感染而言，虽然好处的证据不确定，但严重的副作用很少。在艾滋病毒感染者中，常规使用LPV/r来治疗艾滋病毒与一些中等严重程度的副作用相关。然而，由于冠状病毒感染患者的治疗持续时间通常只有几周，副作用的发生率预计会低于或少于常规使用中报告的发生率。
抗逆转录病毒药物能用来预防COVID-19感染吗？,有两项研究称使用LPV/r作为接触后预防SARS-CoV和MERS-CoV的方法。其中一项研究表明，与未服用任何药物的卫生工作者相比，服用LPV/r的卫生工作者中MERS-CoV感染的发生率较低；另一项研究指出，在与SARS患者住在同一病房的19名艾滋病毒感染者中，没有发现SARS-CoV感染病例，其中11人正在接受抗逆转录病毒治疗。同样，由于样本量小、所提供药物的可变性以及暴露强度的不确定性，证据的确定性非常低。
正在计划开展哪些关于用抗逆转录病毒药物治疗和预防COVID-19的研究？,计划开展几项随机试验来评估使用抗逆转录病毒药物（主要是LPV/r）与其它药物联合治疗COVID-19的安全性和有效性。预计将从2020年中期开始有结果。
世卫组织对使用抗逆转录病毒药物治疗COVID-19的立场是什么？,目前没有足够的数据来评估LPV/r或其它抗病毒药物治疗COVID-19的有效性。几个国家正在评估LPV/r和其它抗病毒药物的使用，我们欢迎这些调查的结果。同样，作为世卫组织应对疫情工作的一部分，世卫组织研发蓝图（在此处和相关链接中添加超链接）已经启动，以加快对这种新型冠状病毒的诊断方法、疫苗和治疗方法的评估。世卫组织还设计了一套程序来评估紧急情况下医疗技术的性能、质量和安全性。
世卫组织对用糖皮质激素治疗COVID-19的立场是什么？,世卫组织目前关于疑似COVID-19感染时严重急性呼吸道感染临床管理的临时指导文件建议不要使用糖皮质激素，除非另有原因[8]。该指导文件基于几个系统性综述，这些综述列举了用糖皮质激素常规治疗病毒性肺炎或急性呼吸窘迫综合征缺乏有效性和可能有害的情况[9]。
如果各国对COVID-19使用抗逆转录病毒药物，是否存在对艾滋病毒感染者短缺治疗药物的担忧？,抗逆转录病毒药物对艾滋病毒感染者来说是一种有效且高度耐受的治疗方法。目前正在研究是否可以用抗逆转录病毒药物LPV/r来治疗COVID-19。如果将LPV/r用于COVID-19的治疗，应制定一项计划，确保有足够的和持续的供应来满足已经使用LPV/r的所有艾滋病毒感染者和需要开始治疗的艾滋病毒感染者的需求。然而，一小部分人使用包括LPV/r在内的疗法，因为根据世卫组织的艾滋病毒治疗指南，它被用作二线疗法。任何允许使用艾滋病毒药物来治疗COVID-19的国家都必须确保有充足和可持续的供应。
我们如何确保人权并抵制污名化和歧视？,随着全球加大对COVID19大流行的公共卫生应对力度，各国被敦促采取果断行动控制这一流行病。世卫组织敦促所有国家确保保护健康、防止经济和社会混乱以及尊重人权之间的适当平衡。世卫组织正在与包括艾滋病规划署和全球艾滋病毒携带者网络在内的合作伙伴合作，确保在应对COVID-19中不会侵犯人权，确保艾滋病毒携带者或感染者能够与其他人一样获得服务，确保与艾滋病毒相关的服务不受干扰地继续下去。为了减少监狱中暴发COVID19的潜在风险，并降低监狱和其它封闭环境中人们的发病率和死亡率，将监狱和移民拘留中心纳入更广泛的公共卫生对策至关重要。这需要卫生部与司法部之间的密切合作，包括在下述方面达成协议：入境筛查、个人保护措施、保持身体距离、环境清洁和消毒以及限制流动，包括限制转移以及非必要工作人员和访客的进出。在当前情况下，各国努力制定非拘禁策略以防止封闭环境中过度拥挤至关重要[10]。由卫生部而不是司法部或类似机构管理监狱卫生可能会促进这一点[11]。
各项规划如何能够确保继续获得艾滋病毒服务？,重要的是确保在公共卫生领域应对COVID-19大流行中实施隔离措施的情况下也能继续获得基本的艾滋病毒预防、检测和治疗服务。虽然应维持获得基本服务的机会，但应考虑并实施适合的循证措施，以减少可能的传播。这些措施包括[12] ： 对所有患者采取标准预防措施（包括确保所有患者在咳嗽或打喷嚏时用纸巾或手肘捂住口鼻，在疑似感染COVID-19的患者等待服务时为其提供医用口罩，采取手卫生措施等。）卫生保健和外联工作者以及同伴教育者和客户应采取适当的手卫生措施确保分类、早期识别和源头控制（隔离疑似感染COVID-19的患者）确保医疗机构的所有区域都通风良好在所有类型的服务中，所有患者之间最好保持至少1米的空间间隔应始终严格遵循清洁和消毒程序发放较长期间的药物（用于治疗艾滋病毒、结核病和其它慢性疾病，如阿片类药物依赖），减少患者的就诊频率考虑将服务减少至最关键的服务（提供基本的治疗和预防服务；咨询等服务可能会减少或调整）  一般来说，弱势群体，包括重点人群的成员，以及无家可归者和/或流离失所者，感染的风险可能会增加——原因是影响其免疫系统的其它共病，应用隔离和社交距离措施的能力下降，以及获得卫生服务的机会普遍有限。至关重要的是，面向这些人群的服务，如社区服务、免费服务中心和外联服务，能够继续提供挽救生命的预防（分发避孕套、针头和注射器）、检测和治疗，同时确保工作人员和客户的安全。在适用的情况下，可以根据上述考虑调整服务。
抗逆转录病毒药物和其它药物的多月处方和配药的作用是什么？,临床上稳定的成人、儿童、青少年、孕妇和哺乳期妇女以及重点人群的成员（注射毒品者、性工作者、男男性行为者、变性者以及生活在监狱和封闭环境中的人）可以受益于简化的抗逆转录病毒治疗提供模式，该模式包括多月处方和配药（3-6个月的供应），这将减少到诊所的就诊频率，确保在冠状病毒疫情中可能的流动中断期间治疗的连续性。类似地，还应考虑为接受美沙酮或丁丙诺啡替代疗法的临床上稳定的患者提供更大的回家用药的可能性，以减轻卫生部门的额外负担。
感染艾滋病毒的孕妇或产后妇女会将COVID-19病毒传染给其未出生的孩子或婴儿吗？,关于COVID-19在特定人群（如儿童和孕妇）中的临床表现的数据很少[13]，但公布的一项小型研究表明，目前没有在妊娠晚期患上COVID-19肺炎的妇女中发现由垂直传播引起宫内感染的证据[14]。虽然没有垂直传播的记录，但出生后通过与传染性呼吸道分泌物接触发生的传播是一个问题。对于疑似、可能或确诊患有COVID-19的母亲所生的婴儿，应根据标准婴儿喂养指南进行喂养[15]，同时采取必要的预防措施来预防和控制感染。与所有确诊或疑似COVID-19病例一样，正在哺乳或进行皮肤接触或袋鼠妈妈式护理的有症状的母亲应采取呼吸卫生做法，包括在喂养期间（例如，如果母亲有呼吸道症状，在靠近孩子时应佩戴医用口罩），在与孩子接触前后应采取手卫生措施，并且应对有症状的母亲接触过的表面定期进行清洁和消毒[16]。关于COVID-19、妊娠、分娩和母乳喂养的常见问题
对感染COVID-19的携带艾滋病毒的孕妇和哺乳期妇女及其新生儿的管理应有所不同吗？,目前，在COVID-19的临床表现或孕妇和非孕妇或育龄成人的重症风险或胎儿受损风险之间没有已知的区别。考虑到妊娠期间和之后可能与COVID-19症状重叠的免疫和生理适应，疑似或确诊感染COVID-19的孕妇和最近怀孕的妇女应接受支持性和管理治疗。数据有限，但在证据基础提供更明确的信息之前，应特别考虑可能感染COVID-19的有合并疾病的孕妇。在发布这一信息时，没有孕妇死亡的报告[17]，但是，可能需要优先考虑对有症状的孕妇进行COVID-19检测，以便其能够获得专门护理。应向所有新近感染COVID-19或已从COVID-19中康复的孕妇提供关于安全喂养婴儿的信息和建议，以及适当的感染预防和控制措施，以防止COVID-19病毒的传播[18]。在已经确诊或正在调查疾病的情况下，管理与非孕妇类似，应适当隔离已经确诊的或正在接受调查的患者。产科设施必须得到通知并作好准备，注意，任何确诊患有COVID-19的母亲所生的婴儿都应被视为“接受调查者”，并应根据感染预防和控制指南进行隔离。目前尚不清楚感染COVID-19的新生儿患严重并发症的风险是否会增大。
吸烟者感染COVID-19的风险较高吗？,吸烟者可能较易感染COVID-19。吸烟意味着手指（以及可能被污染的卷烟）与嘴唇接触，从而会增加病毒经过手入口的可能性。另外，吸烟者还可能已有肺病或肺活量减少，这将大大加剧他们患重症的风险。 吸水烟等烟草制品的人经常共用烟嘴和吸管，这可能会助长COVID-19在公共场所和社会环境中的传播。导致氧气需求增加或身体正确使用氧气能力减弱的病症（如肺炎）会使患者面临较高的严重肺部疾病风险。
孕妇患COVID-19的风险较高吗？,目前正在研究COVID-19感染对孕妇的影响。虽然相关数据有限，但目前没有证据表明她们患重症的风险高于普通人。我们知道，由于孕妇身体和免疫系统的变化，她们可能会受到一些呼吸道感染的严重影响。因此，她们必须采取预防措施防范COVID-19，并向医护人员报告有关症状（发烧、咳嗽或呼吸困难等）。世卫组织将继续进行审查，并将在获得更多证据后更新其信息和建议。
我怀孕了。我如何防范COVID-19？,孕妇应该像其他人一样采取同样的预防措施，以免感染COVID-19。您可以通过以下方式保护自己：用含酒精成分的免洗洗手液或肥皂和清水勤洗手。保持自己和他人之间的距离，避免拥挤的地方。不触摸眼睛、鼻子和嘴巴。注意呼吸卫生礼仪。咳嗽或打喷嚏时，用弯曲的手肘或纸巾遮住口鼻，然后立即处理用过的纸巾。如果发烧、咳嗽或呼吸困难，应尽早就医。去医疗机构之前先打电话，并遵循当地卫生当局的指示。孕妇和最近分娩的妇女（包括受COVID-19影响的妇女）应该按时去看医护人员，以便获得常规护理服务。
孕妇应该接受COVID-19检测吗？,检测规程和资格因您的居住地而异。 世卫组织建议优先检测有COVID-19症状的孕妇。如果她们患COVID-19，可能需要特殊医护。
孕产妇会将COVID-19传给她未出生的或新生的婴儿吗？,我们尚不清楚患COVID-19的孕妇是否会在妊娠或分娩期间将病毒传给胎儿或婴儿。迄今为止，未在羊水或母乳样本中检出此病毒。
妊娠和分娩期间应该提供何种医护？,所有孕妇，包括确诊或疑似感染COVID-19的孕妇，都有权在产前、产中和产后获得高质量医护，其中包括获得产前、新生儿、产后和精神健康服务。 安全良好分娩体验包括：受到尊重和体面对待；可选一人在分娩时陪同；产科人员清晰沟通；采用适当的缓解疼痛措施；在可能的情况下，允许产妇走动和选择以哪种体位分娩。 处理COVID-19疑似或确诊病例时，卫生工作者应采取所有适当的预防措施，以减少自己和他人的感染风险，包括手卫生和适当使用手套、罩衣和医用口罩等防护装备。
疑似或确诊COVID-19的孕妇需要剖腹产吗？,不。世卫组织建议只有在有合理医学理由的情况下才进行剖腹产。 分娩方式应该因人而异，并基于产妇的偏好和产科指征。
患COVID-19的女性可以母乳喂养吗？,是的。患COVID-19的妇女如果愿意，可以进行母乳喂养。她们应该注意以下事项：喂养期间保持良好呼吸卫生习惯，在可能的情况下佩戴口罩；触摸婴儿前后洗手；例行清洁和消毒所接触过的物品表面。
如果我患COVID-19，还能触摸和抱我的新生宝宝吗？,是的。亲密接触和早期纯母乳喂养有助于婴儿茁壮成长。您应该获得支持，以便能够：安全母乳喂养，喂养时注意保持良好的呼吸卫生习惯； 贴身抚抱新生儿；和宝宝合住一个房间。您应该在触摸宝宝前后洗手，并保持所有表面清洁。
我患有COVID-19，因身体不适而不能直接给宝宝喂奶。我可以怎么做呢？,如果您因患COVID-19或其他并发症而不宜母乳喂养，您应该得到支持，以一种可能的、可用的并且您本人可以接受的方式安全地为婴儿提供母乳。这可以包括：挤出乳汁；再哺乳；使用获得的捐赠母乳。
COVID-19和流感病毒有何相似之处？,首先，COVID-19病毒和流感病毒会导致相似的疾病症状。它们都引起呼吸系统疾病，有的患者无症状或属轻症，有的则患重症甚至死亡。其次，这两种病毒均通过接触、飞沫和污染物传播。因此，可以采取同样的公共卫生措施，例如保持良好的手卫生习惯和呼吸礼仪（咳嗽时屈肘遮掩口鼻或使用纸巾，并立即适当处置用过的纸巾）。这些措施对于预防感染很重要。
COVID-19病毒和流感病毒有什么不同？,这两种病毒的一个重大差异是传播速度。与COVID-19病毒相比，流感的中位潜伏期（从感染到出现症状的时间）较短，病例间隔时间也较短。COVID-19病例间隔时间估计为5-6天，而流感病例间隔时间为3天。这也就是说，流感传播速度可能高于COVID-19。此外，疾病最初3-5天的传播，或在出现症状前可能发生的传播，是流感传播的一个主要驱动因素。相比之下，虽然我们了解到有些人可在症状出现之前24-48小时排放COVID-19病毒，但目前看来这似乎并不是COVID-19传播的主要驱动因素。据了解，COVID-19病毒的基本繁殖数（即一位受感染个人导致的继发感染数）在2到2.5之间，高于流感病毒。但对COVID-19病毒和流感病毒的估算在很大程度上取决于具体环境和时间，因此较难直接比较。儿童是流感病毒社区传播的重要传播源。但初步数据表明儿童受COVID-19病毒感染的程度低于成人，0-19岁年龄组的临床发病率较低。来自中国家庭传播研究项目的进一步初步数据表明，儿童由成人感染，而不是成人由儿童感染。这两种病毒引发的疾病症状相似，但看来重症比例不同。关于COVID-19，迄今为止的数据表明80%的感染是轻症或无症状，15%是严重感染，需要输氧，5%是危重感染，需要插管通气。COVID-19严重和危重感染百分比高于观测到的流感病毒感染情况。儿童、孕妇、老年人、有慢性基础疾病的人和免疫受抑制人群是流感严重感染的高风险人群。而对于COVID-19，我们认为，老龄和基础性疾病会加剧严重感染的风险。COVID-19的死亡率看来高于流感，尤其是高于季节性流感。需要一些时日才能确定COVID-19的实际死亡率。据我们目前掌握的数据，粗死亡率（报告的死亡人数除以报告的病例数）在3%-4%之间，感染死亡率（报告的死亡人数除以感染人数）会低于此数。季节性流感死亡率通常远低于0.1%。死亡率在很大程度上取决于人们获得医疗服务的机会和质量。
针对COVID-19病毒和流感病毒有哪些医疗干预措施？,中国目前正对多种治疗方法进行临床试验。全球共有20多种疫苗在研发中。目前还没有针对COVID-19的已获许可的疫苗或治疗方法。而目前已有多种抗流感病毒药物和疫苗。尽管流感疫苗对COVID-19病毒并无效果，但我们强烈建议每年接种流感疫苗，以防感染流感病毒。
What is a coronavirus?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19."
What is COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019."
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."
How does COVID-19 spread?,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.    Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.    Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating."
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?,"Protection measures for everyoneStay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.Keep up to date on thelatest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 isspreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older personor have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas. Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreadingFollow the guidanceoutlined above (Protectionmeasures for everyone) Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.If you develop fever, coughand difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be dueto a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance andtell your provider of any recenttravel or contact with travelers.Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses."
How likely am I to catch COVID-19?,"The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide. You can see these at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/"
Should I worry about COVID-19?,"Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings. Learn more about how to protect yourself at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"
Who is at risk of developing severe illness?,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes)  appear to develop serious illness more often than others."
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?,"No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection."
Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?,"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available."
"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?","Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. (See Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus)."
Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?,"No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different. SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003."
Should I wear a mask to protect myself?,"Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks  (see Advice on the use of masks). The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. Seebasic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more information."
"How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask?","Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and waterTake the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water."
How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?,"The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available."
Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed.  To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."
Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?,"We are aware of instances of animals and pets ofCOVID-19 patients being infected with the disease;As the intergovernmental body responsible for improving animal healthworldwide, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has been developing technicalguidance on specialised topics related to animal health, dedicated toveterinary services and technical experts (including on testing andquarantine);There is a possibility for some animals to becomeinfected through close contact with infected humans. Further evidence isneeded to understand if animals and pets can spread thedisease;Based on current evidence, human to human transmission remainsthe main driver;It is still too early to say whether cats could be theintermediate host in the transmission of the COVID-19."
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose."
Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported?,"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low."
Is there anything I should not do?,"The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:SmokingWearing multiple masksTaking antibiotics (See question 10 ""Are there any medicines of therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?"")In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider."
Is the source of the coronavirus causing COVID-19 known?,"Currently, the source of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus (CoV) causing COVID-19 is unknown. All available evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a natural animal origin and is not a constructed virus. SARS-CoV-2 virus most probably has its ecological reservoir in bats. SARS-CoV-2, belongs to a group of genetically related viruses, which also include SARS-CoV and a number of other CoVs isolated from bats populations. MERS-CoV also belongs to this group, but is less closely related."
How did the first human SARS-CoV-2 infections occur?,"The first human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan City, China in December 2019. At this stage, it is not possible to determine precisely how humans in China were initially infected with SARS-CoV-2.However, SARS-CoV, the virus which caused the SARS outbreak in 2003, jumped from an animal reservoir (civet cats, a farmed wild animal) to humans and then spread between humans. In a similar way, it is thought that SARS-CoV-2 jumped the species barrier and initially infected humans, but more likely through an intermediate host, that is another animal species more likely to be handled by humans - this could be a domestic animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal and, as of yet, has not been identified.Until the source of this virus is identified and controlled, there is a risk of reintroduction of the virus in the human population and the risk of new outbreaks like the ones we are currently experiencing."
Is COVID-19 airborne?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or surfaces. You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 metre of a person who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your hands."
Is contraception/ family planning safe to use during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Yes. All modern methods of contraception are safe to use, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If you have had a baby in the last six months or have a health condition, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or breast cancer – or if you smoke – seek advice from a health care professional to ensure you are using a method of contraception which is suitable and safe for you."
I want to avoid getting pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic. What can I do?,"If you do not want to become pregnant, you should start or continue to use your contraceptive method of choice. You may be able to access information and contraceptive services from a healthcare provider by phone or online.  If you cannot access these services you may opt for a method that is available without a prescription (such as condoms, spermicides, diaphragm, pills, or emergency contraceptive pills) from a nearby pharmacy or drug shop."
I can’t access my contraceptive method of choice. What do you advise?,"If you cannot access your contraceptive method of choice – perhaps because it requires a prescription, or because it can only be given to you by a health worker – consider using condoms, fertility awareness-based methods, lactational amenorrhea (if you are exclusively breastfeeding), or other contraceptive methods that are recommended for self-care in your country.  Depending on the situation in your country, methods recommended for self-care could include the pill or mini-pill, emergency contraception pills, and DMPA-SC (Sayana Press®)."
What is the best contraceptive method to use during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"All modern methods of contraception help to prevent pregnancy. Women and their partners can choose any modern contraceptive method that is acceptable to and safe for them. The best method of contraception is the one that works well for you.There is a wide variety of modern methods, one of which may suit you best. For more information see here. Condoms, when they are used consistently and correctly, are the only method of contraception that help to prevent unintended pregnancy and protect against sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.  They can be used together with other methods of contraception to protect against both unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.Emergency contraceptive pills can prevent up to 95% of pregnancies when taken within 5 days after intercourse, and they can be taken by anyone with or without a health condition"
I want to change my contraceptive method – is this possible?,"Yes. It may be difficult however, to access all the methods of contraception that are normally available in your country due to restrictions on movement, lack of supply, as well as increased demands on health providers and services.  If you have a pre-existing health condition, consult a provider to find out what options suit you best, and which are available and feasible. Seek advice and information from your health provider and consider using methods that do not have medical restrictions like minipills, condoms, fertility awareness-based methods, diaphragm, spermicides or lactational amenorrhea if you are exclusively breastfeeding."
I want to remove or replace my implant or IUD – can I do this during COVID-19 pandemic?,"Removal of long acting methods such as implants or IUDs, after the recommended period of use (and routine follow up appointments) may not be prioritized by your country’s health system during this health emergency. Seek advice from your health provider. If, due to restrictions on movement due to the COVID-19 pandemic you cannot have your long acting method removed straight away, it is important to use another method of contraception to avoid pregnancy at this time.   There are no medical problems caused by delaying removal of long acting methods such as implants or IUDs. Do not try to remove the contraception method yourself; wait until you are able to access health care from a trained provider."
"Why is providing contraception/ family planning, as well as family planning services and information, important during the COVID-19 pandemic?","Contraception and family planning information and services are life-saving and important at all times. Sexual activity does not cease with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is therefore crucial to ensure that people are able to access rights-based services and information to initiate and / or continue use of contraception. By preventing unintended pregnancies, contraception helps to protect girls and women from the negative health consequences of unintended pregnancies, which can save their lives. Contraception reduces the need for abortion, meaning that women and girls are less at risk of unsafe abortion, which again can be lifesaving.  Condoms, when used consistently and correctly, help to prevent both unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (including STIs).  In addition, by preventing the negative health consequences associated with unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV), contraception can help alleviate unnecessary additional pressure on already-stretched health systems which are working hard to address COVID-19."
I am a policy maker. What can I do to make sure people can access contraception and family planning information and services?,"Plan and develop innovative strategies to ensure as many eligible people as possible can access information and contraception during this period. Increase use of mobile phones and digital technologies to help people make decisions about which contraceptive methods to use, and how they can be accessed.  Enable health care workers to provide contraceptive information and services as per national guidelines to the full extent possible.  This is particularly important where pregnancy poses a high risk to health.   Expand availability of contraceptive services (including both information and methods) through places other than healthcare facilities, such as pharmacies, drug shops, online platforms and other outlets.  This can be with or without prescription depending on national guidelines and contraceptive method.   Relax restrictions on the number of repeat issues of prescription-only hormonal contraceptives that can be issued. Ensure access to emergency post-coital contraception, including consideration of over the counter provision. Enable access to contraception for women and girls in the immediate post-partum and post abortion periods when they may access health services."
I am a programme manager. What can I do to help people access contraception and family planning information and services?,"Increase use of telehealth for counselling and sharing of messages related to safe and effective use of contraception and for selection and initiation of contraceptives. Ensure adequate inventory to avoid potential stock outs at all levels of the health system. Prepare advisories for users on how they can access contraceptive information, services and supplies. Monitor contraceptive consumption in your area to identify any potential pitfall and shortage.Increase availability and access to the contraceptives which can be used by the client without service provider support."
How large does a meeting or event need to be in order to be a “mass gathering”?,"High profile international sporting events such as the Olympics or World Cups as well as international religious events such as the Hajj count as mass gatherings. However, lower profile conferences and events can also meet WHO’s definition of a mass gathering. An event counts as a “mass gatherings” if the number of people it brings together is so large that it has the potential to strain the planning and response resources of the health system in the community where it takes place. You need to consider the location and duration of the event as well as the number of participants. For example, if the event takes place over several days in a small island state where the capacity of the health system is quite limited then even an event with just a few thousand participants could place a big strain on the health system and then be considered a “mass gathering” event. Conversely, if the event is held in a big city in a country with a large, well-resourced health system and lasts just a few hours, the event may not constitute a “mass gathering” event."
Does WHO recommend that all international mass gatherings be cancelled because of COVID-19?,"No. As each international mass gathering is different, the factors to consider when determining if the event should be cancelled may also differ. Any decision to change a planned international gathering should be based on a careful assessment of the risks and how they can be managed, and the level of event planning. The assessment should involve all stakeholders in the event, and in particular the health authorities in the country or community where the event is due to take place. These authorities and stakeholders are in the best position to assess the level of stress the event might place on the local health system and emergency services – and whether this level of stress is acceptable in the current situation. It is WHO’s view that all countries with community transmission should seriously consider postponing or reducing mass gatherings that bring people together and have the potential to amplify disease and support the recommended best practice of physical distancing. Any decision will be supported through the use of WHO tools, in particular the Risk Assessment for Mass Gatherings during COVID-19. If movement restrictions and further national measures have been established in the country, the WHO RA does not apply. However, when the process of re-opening/conducting mass gatherings is being considered post movement restrictions, it will be key to ensure any decisions are based on a risk assessment, such as the WHO Mass gatherings COVID-19 risk assessment."
What factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not?,"For countries not currently known to be experiencing community transmission of COVID-19, the priority consideration will be whether the planned mass gathering event substantially increases the risk of the virus entering the country and becoming established, as well as the risk for participants to importing infection back to their home country and further increasing global spread. In making this assessment, the organizers and their national or local health authorities should recognize that the risk of imported cases of COVID-19 is naturally linked to international travel. They should also recognize that it is neither realistic or desirable to aim for zero risk. When organizers and health authorities are determining whether to hold a mass gathering, they should determine what is an acceptable risk and what additional measures should be implemented to mitigate the risks.For countries where COVID-19 has already started to spread in the community, key consideration will be: aiming at containing or at least slowing down the spread of the virus in the local community/country.preventing participants from other countries being infected with COVID-19  In each case the risk should be considered in the context of the known features of COVID-19, its severity, its transmissibility and the effectiveness of measures to prevent or reduce transmission. The strain already placed on the local health system in responding to COVID-19 outbreak(s), and the additional strain the mass gathering might place on the system also need to be taken into account.You can find more advice on what to look at in the WHO document Key planning recommendations for Mass Gatherings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak of 14 February 2020. See: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/key-planning-recommendations-for-mass-gatherings-in-the-context-of-the-current-covid-19-outbreak"
What if my organization does not have the expertise to assess the risks COVID-19 poses for our planned mass gathering?,The national and local public health authorities in the country where you plan to hold the mass gathering will most likely know how to conduct a health risk assessment. If there is a WHO Country Office there they may also be able to provide some expert support. So too might the WHO Regional Office in your part of the world. You can find the names and contact details of the WHO Regional Offices at https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/regional-offices
"If we go ahead with an international mass gathering, what can we do to reduce the risk of participants catching COVID-19?","Promote hand washing, respiratory hygiene and social distancing at the event. Make sure you have emergency contact details for all participants, including where they are staying during the event. You should make it clear to them that this information will be shared with the local public health authorities to enable rapid contact tracing if a participant at the event becomes ill with COVID-19. The event organisers need to have an agreed preparedness plan in case one or more participants become ill with COVID-19 symptoms. This should include rapid isolation of the ill person and their safe transfer to a local health facility. You should consider whether the number of participants at the event could be reduced, making available participation by video or teleconference and possibly screening participants for COVID-19 symptoms (cough, fever, malaise) at points of entry to the venue. You can find advice on how individual participants can protect themselves and their loved ones from COVID-19 at: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"
Where can I find more advice on assessing and managing health risks around international mass gatherings?,"WHO has produced guidance and also a training course on how to plan for a mass gathering. The guidance and the course both look at how to conduct a risk assessment, plan for and manage health risks in partnership with the local authorities: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/points-of-entry-and-mass-gatherings  You can find advice to give individual participants on how to protect themselves and their loved ones from COVID-19 at: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"
"How can you clean soiled bedding, towels and linens from patients with COVID-19?","All individuals dealing with soiled bedding, towels and clothes from patients with COVID-19 should: Wear appropriate personal protective equipment, which includes heavy duty gloves, mask, eye protection (face shield/goggles), long-sleeved gown, apron (if gown is not fluid resistant), boots or closed shoes before touching any soiled linen.Never carry soiled linen against body; place soiled linen in a clearly labelled, leak-proof container (e.g. bag, bucket)If there is any solid excrement on the linen, such as feces or vomit, scrape it off carefully with a flat, firm object and put it in the commode or designated toilet/latrine before putting linen in the designated container. If the latrine is not in the same room as the patient, place soiled excrement in covered bucket to dispose of in the toilet or latrine; Wash and disinfect linen: washing by machine with warm water (60-90°C) and laundry detergent is recommended for cleaning and disinfection of linens. If machine washing is not possible, linen can be soaked in hot water and soap in a large drum, using a stick to stir, avoiding splashing. If hot water not available, soak linen in 0.05% chlorine for approximately 30 minutes.  Finally, rinse with clean water and let linen dry fully in the sunlight.Additional resources for best practices for environmental cleaning can be found in the following two documents: 1) Infection prevention and control of epidemic-and pandemic prone acute respiratory infections in health care2) Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning in Healthcare Facilities in Resource-Limited Settings which was developed by CDC and ICAN in collaboration with WHO"
"What are the recommendation regarding disinfection of vehicles, goods and products coming from China or other COVID-19 affected countries?","To date there is no epidemiological information to suggestthat contact with goods, products or vehicles shipped from COVID-19 affectedcountries have been the source of COVID-19 in humans.For these reasons, there is no disinfection recommendationsfor any goods and products coming from COVID-19 affected countries given thatthere is no available evidence that these products pose a risk to publichealth. WHO will continue to closely monitor the evolution ofCOVID-19, and will update the recommendations as needed."
What personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used by healthcare workers (HCW) performing nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swabs on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19?,"Health care workers collecting NP and OP swab specimens from suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients should be well-trained on the procedure and should wear a clean, non-sterile, long-sleeve gown, a medical mask, eye protection (i.e., googles or face shield), and gloves. Procedure should be conducted in a separate/isolation room, and during NP specimen collection health care workers should request the patients to cover their mouth with a medical mask or tissue. Although collection of NP and OP swabs have the potential to induce fits of coughing from the patient undergoing the procedure, there is no currently available evidence that cough generated via NP/OP specimen collection leads to increased risk of COVID-19 transmission via aerosols."
Should blood centers routinely screen blood products for COVID-19 virus?,"No, although RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in blood of symptomatic COVID-19 patients, this does not mean that the virus is viable/infectious. In general, respiratory viruses are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion. Blood centers should have routine blood donor screening measures in place to prevent individuals with respiratory symptoms or fever from donating blood.  As precautionary measures, blood centers might encourage self-deferral of those with travel history to an COVID-19 affected country in the previous 14 days, or of those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or are close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case."
"Are boots, impermeable aprons, or coverall suits required as routine personal protective equipment (PE) for healthcare workers (HCW) caring for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection?","No. Current WHO guidance for HCW caring for suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients recommends the use of contact and droplet precautions, in addition to standard precautions which should always be used by all HCW for all patients. In terms of PPE, contact and droplet precautions include wearing disposable gloves to protect hands, and clean, non-sterile, long-sleeve gown to protect clothes from contamination, medical masks to protect nose and mouth, and eye protection (e.g., goggles, face shield), before entering the room where suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients are admitted. Respirators (e.g. N95) are only required for aerosol generating procedures. For more information on PPE for HCW caring for suspected or confirmed nCoV patients, click here."
Can disposable medical face masks be sterilized and reused?,"No. Disposable medical face masks are intended for a single use only. After use they should be removed using appropriate techniques (i.e. do no touch the front, remove by pulling the elastic ear straps or laces from behind) and disposed of immediately in an infectious waste bin with a lid, followed by hand hygiene. For more information on using masks in the context of the nCoV outbreak, click here."
Why does WHO recommend contact and droplet precautions and not routine use of airborne precautions for healthcare workers providing care to patients with suspected/confirmed 2019-nCoV infection?,"WHO developed its rapid guidance based on the consensus of international experts who considered the currently available evidence on the modes of transmission of 2019-nCoV. This evidence demonstrates viral transmission by droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces of equipment; it does not support routine airborne transmission. Airborne transmission may happen, as has been shown with other viral respiratory diseases, during aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy), thus WHO recommends airborne precautions for these procedures. For more information about healthcare worker protection for 2019-nCoV, click here."
Does WHO recommend routine wearing masks for healthy people during the 2019 nCoV outbreak?,"No. WHO does not recommend that asymptomatic individuals (i.e., who do not have respiratory symptoms) in the community should wear medical masks, as currently there is no evidence that routine use of medical masks by healthy individuals prevents 2019-nCoV transmission. Masks are recommended to be used by symptomatic persons in the community. Misuse and overuse of medical masks may cause serious issues of shortage of stocks and lack of mask availability for those who actually need to wear them. In health care facilities where health care workers are directly taking care of suspect or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients, masks are an important part of containing 2019-nCoV spread between people, along with other PPE and hand hygiene. For more information on medical mask use, click here."
Can patients with suspected and confirmed nCoV infection be cohorted in the same room?,"Ideally, suspected and confirmed 2019-nCoV acure respiratory disease patients should be isolated in single rooms. However, when this is not feasible (e.g., limited number of single rooms), cohorting is an acceptable option. Some patients with suspected 2019-nCoV infection may actually have other respiratory illnesses, hence they must be cohorted separately from patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. A minimum of 1-meter distance between beds should be maintained at all times."
Do patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV need to be hospitalized if they have mild illness?,"No. For patients who have mild illness, e.g., low-grade fever, cough, malaise, rhinorrhoea, sore throat without any warning signs, such as shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing, increased respiratory (i.e. sputum or haemoptysis), gastro-intestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea and without changes in mental status, hospitalization may not be required unless there is concern for rapid clinical deterioration. All patients discharged home should be instructed to return to hospital if they develop any worsening of illness. For more information on admission criteria, please click here.For more information on caring for mildly symptomatic 2019-nCoV patients at home, please click here."
Are specialized or referral hospitals required for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection when hospitalization is needed?,"No. Current WHO recommendations do not include a requirement for exclusive use of specialized or referral hospitals to treat suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients. However, countries or local jurisdictions may choose to care for patients at such hospitals if those are deemed the most likely to be able to safely care for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection or for other clinical reasons (e.g., availability of advanced life support). Regardless, any healthcare facility treating patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV patients should adhere to the WHO infection prevention and control recommendations for healthcare to protect patients, staff and visitors. Click here for the guidance."
What are the disinfectants recommended for environmental cleaning in healthcare facilities or homes housing patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection?,"Environmental cleaning in healthcare facilities or homes housing patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection should use disinfectants that are active against enveloped viruses, such as 2019-nCoV and other coronaviruses. There are many disinfectants, including commonly used hospital disinfectants, that are active against enveloped viruses. Currently WHO recommendations include the use of:70% Ethyl alcohol to disinfect reusable dedicated equipment (e.g., thermometers) between usesSodium hypochlorite at 0.5% (equivalent 5000ppm) for disinfection of frequently touched surfaces in homes or healthcare facilitiesClick here for the guidance on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected.Click here for the guidance on infection prevention and control during health care when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected.More information about environmental cleaning can be found here."
How long the 2019-nCoV can survive on a dry surface?,"There is currently no data available on stability of 2019-nCoV on surfaces.  Data from laboratory studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have shown that stability in the environment depends on several factors including relative temperature, humidity, and surface type. WHO continues to monitor existing evidence around nCoV and will update when such evidence is available."
Is there a special procedure regarding waste produced by patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV?,"No. Waste produced during the health care or home care of patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection should be disposed of as infectious waste. For more information on disposing of infectious waste, please click here. Or visit CDC website here."
Are there special procedures for the management of bodies of persons who have died from 2019-nCoV?,"No, there are no special procedures for the management of bodies of persons who have died from 2019-nCoV. Authorities and medical facilities should proceed with their existing policies and regulations that guide post-mortem management of persons who died from infectious diseases."
Is there a model for setting up an isolation ward and types and products and health requirements?,A model for setting up an isolation ward is currently under development. PPE specifications for healthcare workers caring for nCoV patients can be found  in the disease commodity package at: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/disease-commodity-package---novel-coronavirus-(ncov)
Can chlorine solutions also be used?,"Chlorine solutions are strongly discouraged as they carry a higher risk of hand irritation and ill health effects from making and diluting chlorine solutions, including eye irritation and respiratory problems. In addition, there is a risk of loss of antimicrobial effect if exposed to sunlight or heat.  Preparing chlorine solutions requires training to reach the correct dose of 0.05% with varying strengths of bleach available in the private sector.  Even if stored at a cool dry place with a lid away from sunlight, they have to be renewed daily.  In comparison simple soapy water solution do not have any of the above-mentioned health risks and complications including loss of antiviral effect due to heat or sunlight.  The antiviral effect of soapy water is due to the oily surface membrane of the COVID-virus that is dissolved by soap, killing the virus."

It can reduce high blood pressure, help manage weight and reduce the riskof heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers. It alsoimproves bone and muscle strength and increases balance, flexibility andfitness. For older people, activities that improve balance help to preventfalls and injuries. For children, regular physical activity helps supporthealthy growth and development and reduce the risk of disease in later life,and through regular activity, children can develop fundamental movement skillsand build social relationships.Regular physical activity also improves mental healthand can reduce the risk of depression, cognitive decline and delay the onset ofdementia - and improve overall feelings of wellbeing."
How much physical activity is recommended?,"WHO has detailed recommendations on the amount of physical activity people of all ages should do to benefit their health and wellbeing. (available here for children under age of 5 and here for youth, adults and olders) Here are the minimum levels we recommend:Infants under the age of 1 year need to be physically active several times a day.Children under 5 years of age should spend at least 180 minutes a day in physical activities, with 3-4 year-olds being moderately or vigorously active for an hour a day.Children and adolescents aged 5-17yearsall children and adolescents should do at least 60 minutes a day of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity, including activities that strengthen muscle and bone, at least 3 days per week.Adults aged over 18 years should do a total of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity throughout the week, including muscle-strengthening activities 2 or more days perweek.older adults with poor mobility should do physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls on 3 or more days per week.  But any physical activity is better than none.  Start with small amounts and gradually increase duration, frequency and intensity over time. Being active during the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging for us all.  Because the opportunities to be physically active seem to be more restricted, it is even more important to plan in every day the ways to be active and to reduce the time spentsitting for long periods. Put simply, it is a critical time to ensure we all move more and sit less."
So how do I stay safe while exercising in COVID-19?,"Do not exercise if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Stay home and rest, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.If you are able to go for a walk or bicycle ride always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. If you go to a park or public open space to walk, run or exercise always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap, before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. Follow the directions of your local health authority in regards to any restrictions on the number of people with you and/or restrictions on the use of public outdoor play or exercise equipment. If you are not regularly active start slowly and with low intensity activities, like walking and low impact exercises. Start with shorter amounts, like 5-10 minutes, and gradually build up to 30 minutes or more continuously over a few weeks. It is better and safer to be active for short periods more frequently than to try and be active for long periods when you are not used to it. Choose the right activity so that you reduce the risk of injury and that you enjoy the activity. Choose the right intensity according to your health status and fitness level. You should be able to breath comfortably and hold a conversation while you do light- and moderate-intensity physical activity."
How do I stay active in and around the home?,"Try and reduce long periods of time spent sitting, whether for work, studying, watching TV, reading, or using social media or playing games using screens. Reduce sitting for long periods by taking short 3-5 minute breaks every 20-30 minutes.Simply stand up and stretch or even better, take a walk around the house, up and down the stairs, or into the garden. By just moving around and stretching you can improve your health and wellbeing. For more ideas and illustrations of healthy stretchessee here.Set up a regular routine to be active every day, by planning a physical activity or exercise break either by yourself, by joining an online class, or by setting up a time to be active online with your friends or colleagues. Making a specifictime to be active helps ensure you get your daily physical activity. Put the time in your diary, and it will help remind you. Stick with it, as this will help you build a regular routine, and help you adjust to new ways of working, study and familylife under COVID-19 restrictionsBe active with your family and friends, connecting with others can help you and your family in the home and elsewhere spend time together and be active. Planning time to be active with your children withactive games at home, walks in the parks, or cycling can be a way the whole family can relax, be together and be active and healthy whilst at home.   Set yourself and your family Be Active goals, by choosing a specific type of activity, time of day and/or number of minutes you will do every day. Get each family member to choose their own goal which sets a bit of a challenge but isrealistic with help from family or friends and motivation. Record your progress on a weekly activity chart and, if you think it would help, reward yourself with something you value.http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-technical-guidance/stay-physically-active-during-self-quarantine/_recache?fbclid=IwAR2RQYVYBnmpDCMjBwqmoz0hZxzmit_9yKzXu6ZhjGNywRTEzWOUQefU8V0More physical activity ideas to help you stay activeFor Infants under 1 year of ageSpend regular time doing floor-based play with your baby in a prone position (‘tummy time’) and spread this throughout the day while baby is awake.For Children under 5 years of ageActive play in and around the home – invent games which involve being active and can develop skills in throwing, catching, kicking, as well as developing posture and balance.Active play and games where children get out of breath, such as running around, skipping and jumping.For Children and adolescents aged 5-17 yearsActive games and active play with family.Join in online active games or activity classes, also look for online physical education classes as well as exercise routines suitable for adolescents.Set up playground games indoors such as Jump rope and hop-scotch – make up new games and challenges that involve being active.

How many malaria-affected countries have reported cases of COVID-19?,"Malaria-endemic countries in all WHO regions have reported cases of COVID-19. In the WHO African Region, which carries more than 90% of the global malaria burden, 37 countries had reported cases of the disease as of 25 March; of these, 10 countries reported local transmission of the disease. The latest situation reports on the COVID-19 pandemic are available on the WHO website."
Should core malaria vector control interventions be maintained in view of the rapid global spread of COVID-19?,"In recent days, there have been reports of the suspension of insecticide-treated net (ITN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaigns in several African countries due to concerns around exposure to COVID-19. Suspending such campaigns will leave many vulnerable populations at greater risk of malaria, particularly young children and pregnant women. WHO strongly encourages countries not to suspend the planning for – or implementation of – vector control activities, including ITN and IRS campaigns, while ensuring these services are delivered using best practices to protect health workers and communities from COVID-19 infection. Modifications of planned distribution strategies may be needed to minimize exposure to the coronavirus. The Alliance for Malaria Prevention has provided valuable guidance for national malaria control programmes on the distribution of ITNs in the context of the COVID-19 response; these recommendations are consistent with WHO global guidance.For the implementation of IRS campaigns, WHO supports guidance developed by the U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative in the context of COVID-19. Among other actions, the guidance advises IRS deployment teams to: increase the number of hand washing stations and soap at all operations sites; reinforce morning health checks for all team members, adding temperature checks where feasible; wear N-95 masks and personal protective equipment before entering operations sites; and frequently wipe down any touched surfaces (door handles, vehicle railings, etc). In addition to the above recommendations, basic WHO-recommended protective measures should be provided for the general population."
Should WHO-recommended preventive therapies be maintained in sub-Saharan Africa?,"Yes, delivery of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), and intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) should be maintained provided that best practices for protecting health workers – and other front-line workers – from COVID-19 are followed. Ensuring access to these and other core malaria prevention tools saves lives and is an important strategy for reducing the strain on health systems in the context of the COVID-19 response.New guidance from WHO describes the rights, roles and responsibilities of health workers in the context of COVID-19. WHO has also developed guidance for countries to safely maintain essential health services during the pandemic."
Are there any changes to WHO guidance with respect to malaria diagnosis and treatment?,WHO guidance remains the same. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent a mild case of malaria from progressing to severe illness or death. Countries should not scale back efforts to detect and treat malaria; doing so would seriously undermine the health and well-being of millions of people infected with a potentially life-threatening disease.
What additional special measures may be needed in the context of COVID-19?,"In addition to routine approaches to malaria control, there may be a case for special measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic – such as a temporary return to presumptive malaria treatment, or the use of mass drug administration – which have proved useful in some previous emergencies. Presumptive malaria treatment refers to treatment of a suspected malaria case without the benefit of diagnostic confirmation (e.g. through a rapid diagnostic test). This approach is typically reserved for extreme circumstances, such as disease in settings where prompt diagnosis is no longer available.Mass drug administration (MDA) is a WHO-recommended approach for rapidly reducing malaria mortality and morbidity during epidemics and in complex emergency settings. Through MDA, all individuals in a targeted population are given antimalarial medicines – often at repeated intervals – regardless of whether or not they show symptoms of the disease. Such special measures should only be adopted after careful consideration of 2 key aims: lowering malaria-related mortality and keeping health workers safe. WHO is exploring concrete proposals for when and how to activate such measures; guidance will be published in due course."
Why is WHO particularly concerned about the spread of COVID-19 in malaria-affected areas?,"Experience from previous disease outbreaks has shown the disruptive effect on health service delivery and the consequences for diseases such as malaria. The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, for example, undermined malaria control efforts and led to a massive increase in malaria-related illness and death in the 3 countries.In recent weeks, the COVID-19 pandemic has tested the resilience of robust health systems around the world. Recognizing the heavy toll that malaria exacts on vulnerable populations in countries with fragile health systems, WHO underlines the critical importance of sustaining efforts to prevent, detect and treat malaria. In all regions, protective measures should be utilized to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission between patients, communities and health providers. WHO has developed detailed guidance for health workers in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak response, as well as operational guidance for safely maintaining essential health services."
What are the key considerations for countries that are working to eliminate malaria or prevent re-establishment of transmission?,"All of the considerations described above apply to malaria-eliminating countries and those preventing re-establishment of the disease: efforts must be sustained to prevent, detect and treat malaria cases while preventing the spread of COVID-19 and ensuring the safety of those who deliver the services. Countries that are nearing malaria elimination must protect their important gains and avoid malaria resurgences. Countries that have eliminated malaria must remain vigilant for any imported cases of malaria that may be occurring to prevent reintroduction of the disease."
Have there been disruptions in the global supply of key malaria-related commodities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Yes. In recent days, there have been reports of disruptions in the supply chains of essential malaria commodities – such as long-lasting insecticidal nets, rapid diagnostic tests and antimalarial medicines – resulting from lockdowns and from a suspension of the importation and exportation of goods in response to COVID-19. Coordinated action is required to ensure the availability of key malaria control tools, particularly in countries with a high burden of the disease, and that efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 do not compromise access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment services."
What is WHO doing to support malaria-affected countries in the context of COVID-19?,"WHO is working across the 3 levels of the Organization (country, region and headquarters) to ensure that any advice intended to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and to guide COVID-19 disease management is appropriate in malaria-affected settings.Together with partners, WHO has also identified a set of inter-related actions that are needed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in countries where malaria strikes hardest. The Organization recently convened partners to discuss areasof collaboration and coordination, with the aim of:generating, using and disseminating accurate information; mitigating against health systems disruptions; and ensuring the continuity of routine malaria-specific services while also providing, in some settings, additional special measures.WHO stands ready to work with countries and other stakeholders to mitigate the negative impact of the coronavirus on malaria responses worldwide and, where possible, contribute towards a successful COVID-19 response."
What is WHO’s position on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the context of the COVID-19 response?,"WHO is actively following the ongoing clinical trials that are being conducted in response to COVID-19, including studies looking at the use of chloroquine and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine, for treatment and/or prevention. Currently, there is insufficient data to assess the efficacy of either of these medicines in treating patients with COVID-19, or in preventing them from contracting the coronavirus. Chloroquine is currently recommended by WHO for the treatment of P. vivax malaria. In the context of the COVID-19 response, the dosage and treatment schedules for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine that are currently under consideration do not reflect those used for treating patients with malaria. The ingestion of high doses of these medicines may be associated with adverse or seriously adverse health outcomes. For public health emergencies, WHO has a systematic and transparent process for research and development (R&D), including for clinical trials of drugs. The WHO “R&D Blueprint” for COVID-19, initiated on 7 January 2020, aims to fast-track the availability of effective tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives and avert large-scale crises. WHO has also designed a set of procedures to assess the performance, quality and safety of medical technologies during emergency situations."
Are people living with HIV at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19?,"People living with HIV with advanced disease, those with low CD4 and high viral load and those who are not taking antiretroviral treatment have an increased risk of infections and related complications in general.  It is unknown if the immunosuppression of HIV will put a person at greater risk for COVID-19, thus, until more is known, additional precautions for all people with advanced HIV or poorly controlled HIV, should be employed[1],[2].At present there is no evidence that the risk of infection or complications of COVID-19 is different among people living with HIV who are clinically and immunologically stable on antiretroviral treatment when compared with the general population.  Some people living with HIV may have known risk factors for COVID-19 complications, such as diabetes, hypertension and other noncommunicable diseases and as such may have increased risk of COVID-19 unrelated to HIV.  We know that during the SARS and MERS outbreaks there were only a few case reports of mild disease among people living with HIV.  To date, there is a case report of a person living with HIV who had COVID-19 and recovered[3] and a small study on risk factors and antiretrovirals used among people living with HIV with COVID-19 from China.  This study reported similar rates of COVID-19 disease as compared to the entire population and increased risk with older age, but not with low CD4, high viral load level or antiretroviral regimen[4]. Current clinical data suggest the main mortality risk factors are linked to older age and other comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension. Some very healthy people have also developed severe disease from the coronavirus infection[5].  PLHIV are advised to take the same precautions as the general population[6],[7]: wash hands oftencough etiquette physical distancingseek medical care if symptomaticself-isolation if in contact with someone with COVID-19 and other actions per the government response   People living with HIV who are taking antiretroviral drugs should ensure that they have at least 30 days and up to 6-month supply of medicines and ensure that their vaccinations are up to date (influenza and pneumococcal vaccines). Adequate supplies of medicines to treat co-infections and comorbidities and addiction should also be ensured."
Can antiretrovirals be used to treat COVID-19?,"Several studies have suggested that patients infected with the virus causing COVID-19, and the related coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) had good clinical outcomes, with almost all cases recovering fully.  In some cases, patients were given an antiretroviral drug: lopinavir boosted with ritonavir (LPV/r). These studies were mostly carried out in HIV-negative individuals.It is important to note that these studies using LPV/r had important limitations. The studies were small, timing, duration and dosing for treatment were varied and most patients received co-interventions/co-treatments which may have contributed to the reported outcomes. While the evidence of benefit of using antiretrovirals to treat coronavirus infections is of very low certainty, serious side effects were rare. Among people living with HIV, the routine use of LPV/r as treatment for HIV is associated with several side effects of moderate severity. However, as the duration of treatment in patients with coronavirus infections was generally limited to a few weeks, these occurrences can be expected to be low or less than that reported from routine use."
Can antiretrovirals be used to prevent COVID-19 infection?,"Two studies have reported the use of LPV/r as post-exposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. One of these studies suggested that the occurrence of MERS-CoV infection was lower among health workers receiving LPV/r compared to those who did not receive any drugs; the other study found no cases of SARS-CoV infection among 19 people living with HIV hospitalized in the same ward of SARS patients, of whom 11 were on antiretroviral therapy. Again, the certainty of the evidence is very low due to small sample size, variability in drugs provided, and uncertainty regarding intensity of exposure."
What studies on treatment and prevention of COVID-19 with antiretrovirals are being planned?,"Several randomized trials are planned to assess the safety and efficacy of using antiretroviral drugs – mainly LPV/r – for treating COVID-19, in combination with other drugs. Results are expected from mid-2020 onwards."
What is WHO’s position on the use of antiretrovirals for the treatment of COVID-19?,"Currently, there is insufficient data to assess the effectiveness of LPV/r or other antivirals for treating COVID-19. Several countries are evaluating the use of LPV/r and other antivirals and we welcome the results of these investigations.Again, as part of WHO’s response to the outbreak, the WHO R&D Blueprint has been activated to accelerate evaluation of diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for this novel coronavirus. WHO has also designed a set of procedures to assess the performance, quality and safety of medical technologies during emergency situations."
What is WHO’s position on use of corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19?,The current interim guidance from WHO on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when COVID-19 infection is suspected advises against the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason.[8]This guidance is based on several systematic reviews that cite lack of effectiveness and possible harm from routine treatment with corticosteroids for viral pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.[9]
"If countries use antiretrovirals for COVID-19, are there concerns about treatment shortages for people living with HIV?","Antiretrovirals are an efficacious and highly tolerable treatment for people living with HIV. The antiretroviral LPV/r is currently being investigated as a possible treatment for COVID-19.If they are to be used for the treatment of COVID-19, a plan should be in place to ensure there is adequate and continuous supply to cover the needs of all people living with HIV already using LPV/r and those who will need to begin treatment. However, a relatively small proportion of people are on regimens which include LPV/r, since it is used as a second-line regimen according to WHO’s HIV treatment guidelines. Any country that allows the use of HIV medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 must ensure that an adequate and sustainable supply is in place."
How do we ensure human rights and reduce stigma and discrimination?,"As the world scales up public health responses to the COVID19 pandemic, countries are being urged to take decisive action to control the epidemic. WHO has urged all countries to ensure an appropriate balance between protecting health, preventing economic and social disruption, and respecting human rights.  WHO is working with partners including the UNAIDS Joint Programme and the Global Network of People Living with HIV to ensure that human rights are not eroded in the response to COVID-19 and to ensure that people living with or affected by HIV are offered the same access to services as others and to ensure HIV-related services continue without disruption.To mitigate potential prison outbreaks of COVID19 and reduce morbidity and mortality among people in prisons and other closed settings, it is crucial that prisons and immigration detention centres are embedded within the broader public health response. This requires close collaboration between health and justice ministries and includes protocols for entry screening, personal protection measures, physical distancing, environmental cleaning and disinfection, and restriction of movement, including limitation of transfers and access for non-essential staff and visitors.  In the current context it is of critical importance that countries work toward developing non-custodial strategies to prevent overcrowding in closed settings[10]. Governance of prison health by a ministry of health, rather than a ministry of justice or similar, is likely to facilitate this[11]."
How can programmes assure continued access to HIV services?,"It is important to assure continuous access to essential HIV prevention, testing and treatment services also where measurements of confinement are implemented within the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While access to essential services should be maintained, adapted and evidence-based measures to reduce possible transmission should be considered and implemented.  These include[12]: Applying standard precautions for all patients (including ensuring that all patients cover their nose and mouth with a tissue or elbow when coughing or sneezing, offering a medical mask to patients with suspected COVID-19 infection while they are in waiting in the service, perform hand hygiene etc.) Health care and outreachworkers, as well as peer educators and clients should apply adapted handhygiene measuresEnsuring triage, earlyrecognition, and source control (isolating patients with suspectedCOVID-19 infection)Ensure there is adequateventilation in all areas in the healthcare facilitySpatial separation of at least1 metre should ideally be maintained between all patients within all typesof servicesCleaning and disinfectionprocedures should be followed consistently and correctlyDispensing medicines (for treatment of HIV, TB andother chronic conditions such as opioid dependence) for longer periodsallowing reduced frequency of patient visits Consider reduction of services to the most criticalones (provision of essential treatment and prevention services; servicessuch as counselling sessions may be reduced or adapted)Generally, vulnerable populations, including members of key populations, as well as homeless and/or displaced people may be at increased risk of infection – because of additional comorbidities impacting on their immune system, reduced ability to apply measures of confinement and social distancing, as well as generally limited access to health services.  It is critical that services that reach these populations such as community-based services, drop-in centres and outreach services can continue providing life-saving prevention (distribution of condoms, needles and syringes), testing and treatment while securing safety of staff and clients. Services can be adapted according to above considerations where applicable."
What is the role multi-month prescriptions and dispensing for antiretrovirals and other medicines?,"Clinically stable adults, children, adolescents and pregnant and breastfeeding women as well as members of key populations (people who inject drugs, sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender people and people living in prisons and closed settings) can benefit from simplified antiretroviral therapy delivery models which include multi-month prescriptions and dispensing (3-6 month supply) which will reduce the frequency of visits to clinical settings and ensures continuity of treatment during possible disruption of movements during the coronavirus outbreak.  Similar consideration should be given to providing people who are clinically stable on methadone or buprenorphine substitution therapy with an increased possibility for take-home medications to reduce additional burden on the health sector."
Can pregnant or postpartum women living with HIV transmit the COVID-19 virus to their unborn child or infant?,"There are few data on the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in specific populations, such as children and pregnant women[13] but findings from a small published study suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy[14].  Although no vertical transmission has been documented, transmission after birth via contact with infectious respiratory secretions is a concern. Infants born to mothers with suspected, probable, or confirmed COVID-19 should be fed according to standard infant feeding guidelines[15], while applying necessary precautions for infection prevention and control (IPC).  As with all confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, symptomatic mothers who are breastfeeding or practicing skin-to-skin contact or kangaroo mother care should practice respiratory hygiene, including during feeding (for example, use of a medical mask when near a child if the mother has respiratory symptoms), perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the child, and routinely clean and disinfect surfaces with which the symptomatic mother has been in contact[16].   Q&A on COVID-19, pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding"
Should pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV with COVID-19 and their newborns be managed differently?,"There is currently no known difference between the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 or risk of severe illness or foetal compromise for pregnant and non-pregnant women or adults of reproductive age.  Pregnant and recently pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be treated with supportive and management therapies, considering the immunologic and physiologic adaptations during and after pregnancy which may overlap with COVID-19 symptoms.  Data are limited but, until the evidence base provides clearer information, special consideration should be given to pregnant women with concomitant medical illnesses who could be infected with COVID-19. There are no reported deaths in pregnant women at time of publishing this information[17] however, COVID-19 testing of symptomatic pregnant women may need to be prioritized to enable access to specialized care.  All recently pregnant women with COVID-19 or who have recovered from COVID-19 should be provided with information and counselling on safe infant feeding and appropriate IPC measures to prevent COVID-19 virus transmission[18].With confirmed disease or under investigation, management is similar to non-pregnant women, with appropriate isolation of confirmed or under investigation.  Obstetric facilities must be notified and prepared, noting that each infant born to any mother with confirmed COVID-19 should be considered a ‘person under investigation’ and should be isolated according to the IPC guidance.  Currently, it is unknown whether newborns with COVID-19 are at increased risk for severe complications."
Are smokers and tobacco users at higher risk of COVID-19 infection?,"Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 as the act of smoking means that fingers (and possibly contaminated cigarettes) are in contact with lips which increases the possibility of transmission of virus from hand to mouth. Smokers may also already have lung disease or reduced lung capacity which would greatly increase risk of serious illness.Smoking products such as water pipes often involve the sharing of mouth pieces and hoses, which could facilitate the transmission of COVID-19 in communal and social settings.Conditions that increase oxygen needs or reduce the ability of the body to use it properly will put patients at higher risk of serious lung conditions such as pneumonia."
Are pregnant women at higher risk from COVID-19?,"Research is currently underway to understand the impacts of COVID 19 infection on pregnant women. Data are limited, but at present there is no evidence that they are at higher risk of severe illness than the general population. However, due to changes in their bodies and immune systems, we know that pregnant women can be badly affected by some respiratory infections. It is therefore important that they take precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, and report possible symptoms (including fever, cough or difficulty breathing) to their healthcare provider.WHO will continue to review and update its information and advice as more evidence becomes available."
I’m pregnant. How can I protect myself against COVID-19?,"Pregnant women should take the same precautions to avoid COVID-19 infection as other people. You can help protect yourself by:Washing your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.Keeping space between yourselves and others and avoiding crowded spaces.Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth.Practicing respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.If you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Call before going to a health facility, and follow the directions of your local health authority. Pregnant women and women who have recently delivered – including those affected by COVID-19 - should attend their routine care appointments."
Should pregnant women be tested for COVID-19?,"Testing protocols and eligibility vary depending on where you live. However, WHO recommendations are that pregnant women with symptoms of COVID-19 should be prioritized for testing. If they have COVID-19, they may need specialized care."
Can COVID-19 be passed from a woman to her unborn or newborn baby?,"We still do not know if a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can pass the virus to her foetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery. To date, the virus has not been found in samples of amniotic fluid or breastmilk."
What care should be available during pregnancy and childbirth?,"All pregnant women, including those with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections, have the right to high quality care before, during and after childbirth. This includes antenatal, newborn, postnatal, intrapartum and mental health care.A safe and positive childbirth experience includes:Being treated with respect and dignity;Having a companion of choice present during delivery;Clear communication by maternity staff;Appropriate pain relief strategies:Mobility in labour where possible, and birth position of choice.If COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed, health workers should take all appropriate precautions to reduce risks of infection to themselves and others, including hand hygiene, and appropriate use of protective clothing like gloves, gown and medical mask."
Do pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 need to give birth by caesarean section?,No. WHO advice is that caesarean sections should only be performed when medically justified. The mode of birth should be individualized and based on a woman’s preferences alongside obstetric indications.
Can women with COVID-19 breastfeed?,"Yes. Women with COVID-19 can breastfeed if they wish to do so. They should:Practice respiratory hygiene during feeding, wearing a mask where available; Wash hands before and after touching the baby;Routinely clean and disinfect surfaces they have touched."
Can I touch and hold my newborn baby if I have COVID-19?,"Yes. Close contact and early, exclusive breastfeeding helps a baby to thrive. You should be supported toBreastfeed safely, with good respiratory hygiene; Hold yournewborn skin-to-skin, and Share a roomwith your babyYou should wash your hands before and after touching your baby, and keep all surfaces clean."
I have COVID-19 and am too unwell to breastfeed my baby directly. What can I do?,"If you are too unwell to breastfeed your baby due to COVID-19 or other complications, you should be supported to safely provide your baby with breastmilk in a way possible, available, and acceptable to you. This could include:Expressing milk;Relactation;Donor human milk."
How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses similar?,"Firstly, COVID-19 and influenza viruses have a similar disease presentation. That is, they both cause respiratory disease, which presents as a wide range of illness from asymptomatic or mild through to severe disease and death.Secondly, both viruses are transmitted by contact, droplets and fomites. As a result, the same public health measures, such as hand hygiene and good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue), are important actions all can take to prevent infection."
How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different?,"The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19. Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-symptomatic transmission –transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms – is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission. The reproductive number – the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual – is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult.   Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low. Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from adults, rather than vice versa.While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection. Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care."
What medical interventions are available for COVID-19 and influenza viruses?,"While there are a number of therapeutics currently in clinical trials in China and more than 20 vaccines in development for COVID-19, there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19.  In contrast, antivirals and vaccines available for influenza. While the influenza vaccine is not effective against COVID-19 virus, it is highly recommended to get vaccinated each year to prevent influenza infection."
Qu’est-ce qu’un coronavirus ?,"Les coronavirus forment une vaste famille de virus qui peuvent être pathogènes chez l’homme et chez l’animal. On sait que, chez l’être humain, plusieurs coronavirus peuvent entraîner des infections respiratoiresdont les manifestations vont du simple rhume à des maladies plus graves comme le syndrome respiratoire du Moyen-Orient (MERS) et le syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère (SRAS). Le dernier coronavirus qui a été découvertest responsable de la maladie à coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)."
Qu’est-ce que la COVID-19 ?,La COVID-19 est la maladie infectieuse causée par le dernier coronavirus qui a été découvert. Ce nouveau virus et cette maladie étaient inconnus avant l’apparition de la flambée à Wuhan (Chine)en décembre 2019.
Quels sont les symptômes de la COVID-19 ?,"Les symptômes les plus courants de la COVID-19 sont la fièvre, la fatigue et une toux sèche. Certains patients présentent des douleurs, une congestion nasale, un écoulement nasal, des maux de gorge ou une diarrhée.Ces symptômes sont généralement bénins et apparaissent de manière progressive. Certaines personnes, bien qu’infectées, ne présentent aucun symptôme et se sentent bien. La plupart (environ80 %) des personnes guérissent sans avoir besoin de traitement particulier. Environ une personne sur six contractant la maladie présente des symptômes plus graves, notamment une dyspnée. Les personnes âgéeset celles qui ont d’autres problèmes de santé (hypertension artérielle, problèmes cardiaques ou diabète) ont plus de risques de présenter des symptômes graves. Toute personne qui a de la fièvre,qui tousse et qui a des difficultés à respirer doit consulter un médecin."
Comment la COVID-19 se propage-t-elle ?,"La COVID-19 est transmise par des personnes porteuses du virus. La maladie peut se transmettre d’une personne à l’autre par le biais de gouttelettes respiratoires expulsées par le nez ou par la bouche lorsqu’une personnetousse ou éternue. Ces gouttelettes peuvent se retrouver sur des objets ou des surfaces autour de la personne en question. On peut alors contracter la COVID-19 si on touche ces objets ou ces surfaces et si on se touche ensuite les yeux,le nez ou la bouche. Il est également possible de contracter la COVID-19 en inhalant des gouttelettes d’une personne malade qui vient de tousser ou d’éternuer. C’est pourquoi il est important de se tenir àplus d’un mètre d’une personne malade. L’OMS examine les travaux de recherche en cours sur la manière dont la COVID-19 se propage et elle continuera à communiquer les résultats actualisés."
Le virus responsable de la COVID-19 est-il transmissible par voie aérienne ?,"Les études menées à ce jour semblent indiquer que le virus responsable de la COVID-19 est principalement transmissible par contact avec des gouttelettes respiratoires, plutôt que par voie aérienne. Voir la réponseà la question précédente, « Comment le COVID-19 se propage-t-elle ? »"
Peut-on contracter la COVID-19 au contact d’une personne qui ne présente aucun symptôme ?,"La maladie se propage principalement par les gouttelettes respiratoires expulsées par les personnes qui toussent. Le risque de contracter la COVID-19 au contact d’une personne qui ne présente aucun symptôme est trèsfaible. Cependant, beaucoup de personnes atteintes ne présentent que des symptômes discrets. C’est particulièrement vrai aux premiers stades de la maladie. Il est donc possible de contracter la COVID-19 au contact d’unepersonne qui n’a, par exemple, qu’une toux légère mais qui ne se sent pas malade. L’OMS examine les travaux de recherche en cours sur le délai de transmission de la COVID-19 et elle continuera à communiquerdes résultats actualisés."
Puis-je contracter la COVID-19 par contact avec les matières fécales d’une personne malade ?,"Le risque de contracter la COVID-19 par contact avec les matières fécales d’une personne infectée paraît faible. Les premières investigations semblent indiquer que le virus peut être présent dansles matières fécales dans certains cas, mais la flambée ne se propage pas principalement par cette voie. L’OMS examine les travaux de recherche en cours sur la manière dont la COVID-19 se propage et elle continueraà communiquer les nouveaux résultats. Cependant, comme le risque existe, c’est une raison supplémentaire de se laver les mains régulièrement, après être allé aux toilettes et avant demanger."
Comment puis-je me protéger et éviter que la maladie ne se propage ?,"Mesures de protection pour tous. Tenez-vous au courant des dernières informations sur la flambée de COVID-19, disponibles sur le site Web de l’OMS et auprès des autorités de santé publique nationales et locales. Des cas de COVID-19 se sontproduits dans de nombreux pays et plusieurs pays ont été touchés par des flambées. En Chine et dans certains autres pays, les autorités sont parvenues à ralentir ou à enrayer la progression de laflambée. Toutefois, l’évolution de la situation est imprévisible et vous devez donc vous tenir régulièrement informé. Vous pouvez réduire le risque d’être infecté ou de propager la COVID-19 en prenant quelques précautions simples : Se laver fréquemment et soigneusement les mains avec une solution hydroalcoolique ou à l’eau et au savon. Pourquoi ? Se laver les mains avec une solution hydroalcoolique ou à l’eau et au savon tue le virus s’il est présent sur vos mains. Maintenir une distance d’au moins un mètre avec les autres personnes qui toussent ou qui éternuent. Pourquoi ? Lorsqu’une personne tousse ou éternue, elle projette de petites gouttelettes qui peuvent contenir le virus. Si vous êtes trop près, vous pouvez inhaler ces gouttelettes et donc le virus responsablede la COVID-19 si la personne qui tousse en est porteuse. Éviter de se toucher les yeux, le nez et la bouche. Pourquoi ? Les mains sont en contact avec de nombreuses surfaces qui peuvent être contaminées par le virus. Si vous vous touchez les yeux, le nez ou la bouche, le virus peut pénétrer dans votre organismeet vous pouvez tomber malade. Veillez à respecter les règles d’hygiène respiratoire et à ce que les personnes autour de vous en fassent autant. En cas de toux ou d’éternuement, il faut se couvrir la bouche et le nez avec le plidu coude, ou avec un mouchoir et jeter le mouchoir immédiatement après. Pourquoi ? Les gouttelettes respiratoires propagent des virus. En respectant les règles d’hygiène respiratoire, vous protégez les personnes autour de vous de virus tels que ceux responsables du rhume, dela grippe ou de la COVID-19. Si vous ne vous sentez pas bien, restez chez vous. En cas de fièvre, de toux et de dyspnée, consultez un médecin après l’avoir appelé. Suivez les instructions des autorités sanitaires locales. Pourquoi ? Ce sont les autorités nationales et locales qui disposent des informations les plus récentes sur la situation dans la région où vous vous trouvez. Si vous l’appelez, votre médecinpourra vous orienter rapidement vers l’établissement de santé le plus adapté. En outre, cela vous protègera et évitera la propagation de virus et d’autres agents infectieux. Informez-vous constamment pour savoir quelles sont les villes ou les zones où la COVID-19 se propage à grande échelle. Si possible, évitez de voyager, en particulier si vous êtes âgé ou diabétiqueou si vous avez une maladie cardiaque ou pulmonaire. Pourquoi ? Le risque de contracter la COVID-19 est plus élevé dans ces régions. Mesures de protection pour les personnes qui se trouvent ou qui se sont récemment rendues (au cours des 14 derniers jours) dans des régions où la COVID-19 se propage. Suivez les conseils présentés ci-dessus (Mesures de protection pour tous) Si vous commencez à vous sentir mal et même si vous n’avez que des symptômes bénins (céphalées, légère fièvre (à partir de 37,3 °C) et écoulement nasal modéré),restez chez vous jusqu’à la guérison. Si vous avez absolument besoin que quelqu’un vienne vous ravitailler ou si vous devez sortir, par exemple pour acheter à manger, portez un masque pour éviter d’infecterd’autres personnes. Pourquoi ? Éviter d’entrer en contact avec d’autres personnes et de se rendre dans des établissements de santé permettra à ces établissements de fonctionner plus efficacement et vousprotègera, ainsi que les autres personnes, de la COVID-19 et d’autres maladies virales. En cas de fièvre, de toux et de dyspnée, consultez un médecin sans tarder, car il peut s’agir d’une infection respiratoire ou d’une autre affection grave. Appelez votre médecin et indiquez-lui si vousavez récemment voyagé ou été en contact avec des voyageurs. Pourquoi ? Si vous l’appelez, votre médecin pourra vous orienter rapidement vers l’établissement de santé le plus adapté. En outre, cela vous protègera et évitera la propagationde la COVID-19 et d’autres maladies virales."
Quelle est la probabilité de contracter la COVID-19 ?,"Le risque dépend de l’endroit où vous habitez et, plus précisément, de la présence ou non d’une flambée. Pour la plupart des gens, à la plupart des endroits, le risque de contracter la COVID-19 reste faible. Cependant, la propagation d’intensifie désormais dans certaines villes ou régions. Pour les personnes qui y habitentou s’y rendent, le risque de contracter la COVID-19 est plus élevé. Les gouvernements et les autorités sanitaires prennent des mesures énergiques chaque fois qu’un nouveau cas de COVID-19 est identifié.Respectez les restrictions locales aux voyages, aux déplacements ou aux grands rassemblements. En participant à ces efforts de lutte contre la maladie, vous réduisez le risque de contracter ou de propager la COVID-19. Les flambées de COVID-19 peuvent être endiguées et la transmission peut être enrayée, comme on l’a vu en Chine et dans certains autres pays. Malheureusement, de nouvelles flambées apparaissent rapidement.Il est important de connaître la situation là où vous êtes ou là où vous comptez aller. L’OMS publie quotidiennement des bulletins de situation. Vous pouvez les consulter à l’adressehttps://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/."
La COVID-19 doit-elle m’inquiéter ?,"La COVID-19 est généralement bénigne, en particulier chez l’enfant et le jeune adulte, mais elle peut aussi être grave : 1 malade sur 5 doit être hospitalisé. Il est donc tout à fait normal de s’inquiéterdes conséquences de la flambée de COVID-19 pour soi-même et pour ses proches. Il est possible d’apaiser son inquiétude en prenant des mesures pour se protéger et protéger ses proches et son entourage. Tout d’abord, il faut se laver régulièrement et soigneusement les mains et respecterles règles d’hygiène respiratoire. Deuxièmement, il faut se tenir au courant de la situation et suivre les conseils des autorités sanitaires locales, notamment en ce qui concerne les restrictions aux voyages,aux déplacements et aux rassemblements. Pour plus d’informations sur les moyens de se protéger, consulter : https://www.who.int/fr/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public."
Qui risque d’être atteint d’une forme grave de la maladie ?,"Même si nous devons encore approfondir nos connaissances sur la façon dont la COVID-19 affecte les individus, jusqu’à présent, les personnes âgées et les personnes déjà atteintes d’autresmaladies (comme l’hypertension artérielle, les maladies pulmonaires, le cancer, le diabète ou les cardiopathies) semblent être gravement atteintes plus souvent que les autres."
Les antibiotiques sont-ils efficaces pour prévenir ou traiter la COVID-19 ?,"Non, les antibiotiques n’agissent pas contre les virus, mais seulement contre les infections bactériennes. La COVID-19 étant due à un virus, les antibiotiques sont inefficaces. Ils ne doivent pas être utiliséscomme moyen de prévention ou de traitement de la COVID-19. Ils doivent être utilisés seulement sur prescription médicale pour traiter une infection bactérienne."
Existe-t-il des médicaments ou des thérapies permettant de prévenir ou de guérir la COVID-19 ?,"Certains remèdes occidentaux, traditionnels ou domestiques peuvent apporter du confort et soulager les symptômes de la COVID-19 mais rien ne prouve que les médicaments actuels permettent de prévenir ou de guérir lamaladie. L’OMS ne recommande de prendre aucun médicament, y compris les antibiotiques, en automédication pour prévenir ou guérir la COVID-19. Cependant, plusieurs essais cliniques de médicaments occidentauxou traditionnels sont en cours. L’OMS fournira des informations actualisées dès que les résultats des essais cliniques seront disponibles."
La COVID-19 est-elle la même maladie que le SRAS?,"Non, le virus responsable de la COVID-19 et celui à l’origine du syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère (SRAS) sont génétiquement liés mais ils sont différents. Le SRAS est plus mortel mais beaucoupmoins infectieux que la COVID-19. Il n’y a pas eu de flambée de SRAS dans le monde depuis 2003."
Dois-je porter un masque pour me protéger ?,"L’OMS recommande de faire un usage rationnel des masques médicaux afin d’éviter le gaspillage de ressources précieuses et l’utilisation abusive (voir Conseils relatifs au port du masque). La meilleure façon de se protéger et de protéger les autres contre la COVID-19 est de se laver fréquemment les mains, de se couvrir la bouche avec le pli du coude ou avec un mouchoir et de se tenir à une distanced’au moins un mètre de toute personne qui tousse ou qui éternue. Pour plus d’informations, consulter les mesures de protection de base contre le nouveau coronavirus."
"Comment mettre, utiliser, enlever et éliminer un masque ?","1. Ne pas oublier que seuls les agents de santé, les personnes qui s’occupent de malades et les personnes qui présentent des symptômes respiratoires (fièvre et toux) doivent porter un masque. 2. Avant de mettre un masque, se laver les mains avec une solution hydroalcoolique ou à l’eau et au savon. 3. Vérifier que le masque n’est ni déchiré ni troué. 4. Orienter le masque dans le bon sens (bande métallique vers le haut). 5. Vérifier que la face colorée du masque est placée vers l’extérieur. 6. Placer le masque sur le visage. Pincer la bande métallique ou le bord dur du masque afin qu’il épouse la forme du nez. 7. Tirer le bas du masque pour recouvrir la bouche et le menton. 8. Après usage, retirer le masque, enlever les élastiques de derrière les oreilles tout en éloignant le masque du visage et des vêtements afin d’éviter de toucher des parties du masque éventuellementcontaminées. 9. Jeter le masque dans une poubelle fermée immédiatement après usage. 10. Après avoir touché ou jeté le masque, se laver les mains avec une solution hydroalcoolique ou à l’eau et au savon si elles sont visiblement souillées."
Combien de temps dure la période d’incubation de la COVID-19 ?,La période d’incubation est le temps qui s’écoule entre l’infection et l’apparition des symptômes de la maladie. On estime actuellement que la période d’incubation de la COIVD-19 dure de 1 à14 jours et le plus souvent autour de cinq jours. Ces estimations seront actualisées à mesure que de nouvelles données seront disponibles.
Les êtres humains peuvent-ils contracter la COVID-19 à partir d’une source animale ?,"Les coronavirus sont une grande famille de virus couramment présents chez les chauves-souris et chez d’autres animaux. Occasionnellement ces virus infectent des êtres humains qui peuvent à leur tour propager l’infection.Ainsi, le SARS-CoV est associé aux civettes tandis que le MERS-CoV est transmis par les dromadaires. Les sources animales éventuelles de la COVID-19 n’ont pas encore été confirmées. Pour se protéger, par exemple lorsque l’on va sur des marchés d’animaux vivants, il faut éviter le contact direct avec les animaux et les surfaces en contact avec les animaux et toujours respecter les règlesrelatives à la sécurité sanitaire des aliments. Il faut manipuler la viande crue, le lait et les abats avec précaution pour éviter de contaminer les aliments qui ne sont pas destinés à êtrecuits et il faut s’abstenir de consommer des produits d’origine animale crus ou mal cuits."
Mon animal domestique peut-il me transmettre la COVID-19 ?,"Il y a eu un cas d’infection chez un chien à Hong Kong mais, à ce jour, rien ne prouve que les animaux de compagnie, tels que les chiens ou les chats, peuvent transmettre la COVID-19. La maladie se transmet principalement par lesgouttelettes expulsées par les personnes infectées quand elles toussent, éternuent ou parlent. Pour vous protéger, lavez-vous les mains fréquemment et soigneusement. L’OMS continue à suivre les derniers travaux de recherche sur ce sujet et d’autres questions relatives à la COVID-19 et publiera des informations actualisées à mesure que de nouvelles données seront disponibles."
Combien de temps le virus peut-il survivre sur les surfaces ?,"On ne sait pas avec certitude combien de temps le virus responsable de la COVID-19 survit sur les surfaces mais il semble qu’il se comporte comme les autres coronavirus. Les études (et les informations préliminaires sur la COVID-19) tendent à montrer que les coronavirus peuvent persister sur les surfaces quelques heures à plusieurs jours. Ceci peut dépendre de différents paramètres (p. ex. le type de surface, la température ou l’humidité ambiante). Si vous pensez qu’une surface peut être infectée, nettoyez-la avec un désinfectant ordinaire pour tuer le virus, vous protéger et protéger les autres. Lavez-vous les mains avec une solution hydroalcoolique ouà l’eau et au savon. Évitez de vous toucher les yeux, la bouche ou le nez."
Est-il sans danger de recevoir un colis d’une région où la COVID-19 a été signalée ?,"Oui. La probabilité qu’une personne infectée contamine des marchandises est faible, tout comme le risque de contracter le virus responsable de la COVID-19 par contact avec un colis qui a été déplacé,qui a voyagé et qui a été exposé à différentes conditions et températures."
Y a-t-il des choses à ne pas faire ?,"Les mesures ci-après NE SONT PAS efficaces contre la COVID-19 et peuvent même être dangereuses : FumerPorter plusieurs masques à la foisPrendre des antibiotiques (Voir « Existe-t-il des médicaments ou des thérapies permettant de prévenir ou de guérir la COVID-19 ? »). En tout état de cause, en cas de fièvre, de toux et de dyspnée, consulter un médecin sans tarder afin de limiter le risque de voir l’infection s’aggraver et lui indiquer si vous avez effectuédes voyages récemment.

Quelle doit être la taille d'une réunion ou d'un événement pour qu'il soit qualifié de « rassemblement de masse » ?,"Les événements sportifs internationaux de haut niveau tels que les Jeux olympiques ou les Coupes du monde, ainsi que les événements religieux internationaux tels que le Hadj, sont considérés comme des rassemblements de masse. Toutefois, des congrès et des événements de moindre envergure peuvent également répondre à la définition qu'a donnée l'OMS pour les rassemblements de masse. Un événement est considéré comme un « rassemblement de masse » si le nombre de personnes qu'il va attirer est si important que l'événement risque de peser lourdement sur les ressources en matière de planification et d'action du système sanitaire de la communauté où il a lieu. Il faut prendre en considération le lieu et la durée de l'événement ainsi que le nombre de participants. Par exemple, si l'événement se déroule sur plusieurs jours dans un petit État insulaire où la capacité du système de santé est assez limitée, un événement qui réunirait même ne serait-ce que quelques milliers de participants pourrait imposer une lourde contrainte au système de santé et être alors considéré comme un événement « rassemblant les masses ». Inversement, si l'événement se tient dans une grande ville d'un pays doté d'un système de santé performant et disposant de ressources suffisantes, et ne dure que quelques heures, l'événement ne constituera peut-être pas un événement « rassemblant les masses »."
L'OMS préconise-t-elle d'annuler tous les rassemblements de masse internationaux en raison de la COVID-19 ?,"Non. Étant donné que chaque rassemblement de masse international est différent, les éléments à prendre en compte pour déterminer si l'événement doit être annulé peuvent aussi être différents. Toute décision de modifier un rassemblement international planifié doit se fonder sur une évaluation méticuleuse des risques encourus et sur la manière de gérer ces risques, ainsi que sur le niveau de planification de l'événement. Cette évaluation doit impliquer toutes les parties prenantes à l'événement, et en particulier les autorités sanitaires du pays ou de la communauté où l'événement est censé avoir lieu. Ces autorités et parties prenantes sont les mieux placées pour évaluer le degré de contrainte que l'événement pourrait imposer au système de santé et aux services d'urgence locaux ; et si ce degré de contrainte est acceptable dans la situation actuelle."
Quels sont les éléments que les organisateurs et les autorités sanitaires devraient prendre en considération pour évaluer si les risques sont acceptables ou non ?,"Pour les pays dont on ne sait pas actuellement s'ils connaissent une transmission communautaire de COVID-19, la question prioritaire sera de savoir si l'événement rassemblant les masses qui a été planifié augmente sensiblement le risque que le virus entre dans le pays et s'y établisse, mais aussi le risque que les participants importent le virus dans leur pays d'origine et augmentent encore la propagation mondiale. En procédant à cette évaluation, les organisateurs et leurs autorités sanitaires nationales ou locales devront tenir compte du fait que le risque d'importation de cas de COVID-19 est évidemment lié aux voyages internationaux. Ils devront également tenir compte du fait qu'il n'est ni réaliste ni souhaitable de chercher à exclure tout risque. Lorsque les organisateurs et les autorités sanitaires déterminent s'il faut maintenir un rassemblement de masse, ils doivent déterminer ce qu'est un risque acceptable et quelles mesures supplémentaires devraient être mises en place pour atténuer les risques. S'agissant des pays où la COVID-19 a déjà commencé à se propager dans la communauté, les principaux éléments à prendre en considération seront :de chercher à contenir ou au moins à ralentir la propagation du virus dans la communauté locale / le pays ;d'empêcher les participants arrivant d'autres pays d'être infectés par le virus de la COVID-19. Dans chaque cas, le risque doit être envisagé au regard des caractéristiques connues de la COVID-19, de sa sévérité, de sa transmissibilité, et de l'efficacité des mesures destinées à prévenir ou limiter la transmission. Il faut également prendre en compte la charge déjà imposée au système sanitaire local pour répondre à la flambée (ou aux flambées) de COVID-19, et la charge supplémentaire que le rassemblement de masse pourrait imposer au système.Vous trouverez davantage de conseils sur ce qu'il faut prendre en considération dans le document de l'OMS du 14 février 2020 intitulé Key planning recommendations for Mass Gatherings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak. Voir : https://www.who.int/publications-detail/key-planning-recommendations-for-mass-gatherings-in-the-context-of-the-current-covid-19-outbreak (en anglais)"
Que faire si mon organisation n'a pas l'expertise nécessaire pour évaluer les risques que pose la COVID-19 pour notre rassemblement de masse planifié ?,"Les autorités de santé publique nationales et locales du pays où vous prévoyez d'organiser le rassemblement de masse sauront très probablement comment procéder à une évaluation du risque sanitaire. S'il existe un Bureau de l'OMS dans ce pays, celui-ci peut également être en mesure de vous apporter un appui spécialisé. Tout comme le Bureau régional de l'OMS dans votre partie du monde. Vous trouverez les noms et les coordonnées des Bureaux régionaux de l'OMS à l'adresse https://www.who.int/fr/about/who-we-are/regional-offices"
"Si nous décidons malgré tout d'organiser un rassemblement de masse international, que pouvons-nous faire pour réduire le risque que les participants contractent la COVID-19 ?","Encouragez le lavage des mains, le respect des règles d'hygiène respiratoire et la distanciation sociale lors de l'événement. Assurez-vous d'avoir les coordonnées des personnes à contacter en cas d'urgence pour tous les participants, mais aussi de connaître leur lieu de séjour pendant l'événement. Vous devrez bien leur préciser que ces renseignements seront partagés avec les autorités de santé publique locales pour que la recherche des contacts puisse se faire rapidement s'il arrivait qu'un participant à l'événement contracte la COVID-19. Les organisateurs de l'événement devront avoir arrêté un plan de préparation dans le cas où un ou plusieurs participants développeraient des symptômes de la COVID-19. Ce plan devrait prévoir notamment de pouvoir isoler rapidement la personne malade et d'organiser son transfert en toute sécurité vers un établissement de santé local. Vous devez examiner si le nombre de participants à l'événement pourrait être réduit, en rendant possible la participation par vidéo ou téléconférence et en dépistant éventuellement les symptômes de la COVID-19 (toux, fièvre, malaise) chez les participants lorsqu'ils arrivent aux points d'entrée sur le site de l'événement. Vous trouverez des conseils à donner aux participants individuels sur les moyens de se protéger et de protéger leurs proches contre la COVID-19 à l'adresse : https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"
Où puis-je trouver des conseils supplémentaires sur l'évaluation et la gestion des risques sanitaires dans le cadre des rassemblements de masse internationaux ?,"L'OMS a publié des recommandations et également un cours de formation sur la manière de planifier un rassemblement de masse. Les recommandations ainsi que le cours portent sur la manière de conduire une évaluation des risques, de planifier et de gérer les risques sanitaires en partenariat avec les autorités locales : https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/points-of-entry-and-mass-gatherings (en anglais)   Vous trouverez des conseils à donner aux participants individuels sur les moyens de se protéger et de protéger leurs proches contre la COVID-19 à l'adresse : https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"
"Comment nettoyer les draps, les serviettes et le linge souillés provenant d’un patient atteint de la COVID-19 ?","Toutes les personnes qui manipulent les draps, les serviettes et les vêtements souillés provenant de patients atteints de la COVID-19 doivent :Porter un équipement de protection individuelle approprié, comprenant des gants résistants, un masque, une protection oculaire (écran facial/lunettes), une blouse à manches longues, un tablier (si la blouse n’est pas imperméable), des bottes ou des chaussures fermées avant de toucher du linge souillé.Ne jamais porter le linge souillé contre son corps ; placer le linge souillé dans un récipient étanche et clairement étiqueté (par exemple, un sac, un seau).En présence d’excréments solides sur le linge, tels que des fèces ou des vomissures, les enlever en grattant prudemment avec un objet plat et rigide et les jeter dans la chaise percée ou dans les toilettes/latrines prévues à cet effet avant de placer le linge dans le récipient prévu à cet effet. Si les latrines ne se trouvent pas dans la même pièce que le patient, déposer les excréments solides dans un seau couvert pour les évacuer dans les toilettes ou les latrines.Laver et désinfecter le linge : le lavage en machine à l’eau chaude (60-90°C) et avec de la lessive est recommandé pour nettoyer et désinfecter le linge. Si le lavage en machine n’est pas possible, le linge peut être trempé dans de l’eau chaude et du savon dans un grand tambour, en utilisant un bâton pour remuer et en évitant les éclaboussures. Si l’on ne dispose pas d’eau chaude, faire tremper le linge dans du chlore à 0,05 % pendant 30 minutes environ, puis, rincez à l’eau claire et laissez sécher complètement au soleil.Des ressources supplémentaires sur les meilleures pratiques en matière de nettoyage de l’environnement sont disponibles dans les deux documents suivants :Infection prevention and control of epidemic-and pandemic prone acute respiratory infections in health care (en anglais)Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning in Healthcare Facilities in Resource-Limited Settings (en anglais), document élaboré par les Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) et Infection Control Africa Network (ICAN) en collaboration avec l’OMS"
"Quelles sont les recommandations concernant la désinfection des véhicules, des marchandises et des produits provenant de Chine ou d’autres pays touchés par le virus de la COVID-19 ?","À ce jour, aucune information épidémiologique ne permet d’affirmer que le contact avec des marchandises, des produits ou des véhicules expédiés depuis des pays touchés par le virus de la COVID-19 soit à l’origine de la transmission du virus à l’homme.Pour ces raisons, il n’existe pas de recommandations de désinfection concernant les marchandises et les produits provenant des pays touchés par virus de la COVID-19, étant donné qu’il n’existe pas de preuve que ces produits présentent un risque pour la santé publique. L’OMS continuera à suivre de près l’évolution de la COVID-19 et mettra à jour ses recommandations si nécessaire."
Quel équipement de protection individuelle devraient utiliser les agents de santé effectuant des prélèvements de sécrétions nasopharyngées ou oropharyngées sur des patients présentant une infection ou une suspicion d’infection par le virus de la COVID-19?,"Les agents de santé qui prélèvent des échantillons de sécrétions nasopharyngées (NP) et oropharyngées (OP) sur des cas suspects ou confirmés de virus de la COVID-19 doivent bien connaître la procédure et porter une blouse à manches longues propre et non stérile, un masque médical, une protection oculaire (c’est-à-dire des lunettes ou un écran facial) et des gants. La procédure doit être réalisée dans une salle séparée/isolée, et, pendant la collecte des échantillons NP, les agents de santé doivent demander aux patients de se couvrir la bouche avec un masque médical ou un mouchoir en papier. Bien que le prélèvement d’échantillons NP et OP puisse provoquer des quintes de toux chez le patient durant la procédure, il n’existe actuellement aucune preuve que la toux générée par ces prélèvements entraîne un risque accru de transmission du virus de la COVID-19 par aérosols de sécrétions."
Les centres de transfusion sanguine doivent-ils systématiquement procéder au dépistage du virus de la COVID-19 dans les produits sanguins ?,"Non, bien que des fragments d’ARN du SRAS-CoV-2 aient été détectés dans le sang de patients symptomatiques, cela ne signifie pas que le virus est viable/infectieux. En général, les virus respiratoires ne sont pas connus pour être transmis par transfusion sanguine. Les centres de transfusion sanguine devraient mettre en place des mesures de dépistage systématique des donneurs afin d’éviter que des personnes présentant des symptômes respiratoires ou de la fièvre ne donnent leur sang. Par mesure de précaution, les centres de transfusion sanguine pourraient inciter les personnes ayant voyagé dans un pays touché par le virus de la COVID-19 au cours des 14 jours précédents, ou celles chez qui le virus a été diagnostiqué ou qui sont en contact étroit avec un cas confirmé de COVID-19, à éviter de donner leur sang."
"Les bottes, les tabliers imperméables, ou les combinaisons sont-ils des équipements de protection individuelle devant être systématiquement utilisés par les agents de santé s'occupant de patients présumés ou confirmés atteints de l'infection à 2019-nCoV?","Non. Les orientations actuelles de l'OMS destinées aux agents de santé qui s'occupent de patients présumés ou confirmés atteints de l'infection respiratoire aiguë à 2019-nCoV recommandent d'appliquer les précautions contre le contact et les gouttelettes, en plus des précautions standard qui devraient être systématiquement appliquées par tous les agents de santé pour tous les patients. En termes d'équipements de protection individuelle (EPI), les précautions contre le contact et les gouttelettes consistent à porter des gants jetables pour protéger les mains et une blouse à manches longues, propre et non stérile pour éviter la contamination des vêtements, des masques médicaux pour protéger le nez et la bouche, et une protection oculaire (p. ex. lunettes de protection, écran facial), avant d'entrer dans la pièce où sont admis des patients présumés ou confirmés atteints de l'infection respiratoire aiguë à 2019-nCoV. Les appareils de protection respiratoire (p. ex. respirateur N95) ne sont nécessaires que pour les actes générant des aérosols. Pour plus d'informations sur les EPI destinés aux agents de santé qui s'occupent de patients atteints d'une infection à nCoV présumée ou confirmée, cliquez ici : https://www.who.int/fr/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control-during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected-20200125"
Les masques médicaux jetables peuvent-ils être stérilisés et réutilisés ?,"Non. Les masques médicaux jetables sont destinés à un usage unique. Après avoir utilisé un masque médical, il faut l’enlever à l'aide de techniques appropriées (c'est-à-dire, ne pas toucher sa partie avant, l'enlever en saisissant par l'arrière les lanières ou les brides élastiques qui passent autour des oreilles) et s'en débarrasser immédiatement dans un réceptacle à déchets infectieux muni d'un couvercle, puis pratiquer les gestes d'hygiène des mains. Pour plus d'informations sur l'utilisation des masques dans le contexte de la flambée à nCoV, cliquez ici : https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-health-care-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak (en anglais)"
Pourquoi l'OMS recommande-t-elle les précautions contre le contact et les gouttelettes et pas l'application des précautions contre la transmission aéroportée pour les agents de santé prodiguant des soins aux patients atteints d'une infection à 2019-nCoV ?,"L'OMS a mis au point ses brèves orientations en se fondant sur le consensus d'experts internationaux qui ont examiné les données probantes actuellement disponibles sur les modes de transmission du 2019-nCoV. Ces données démontrent que la transmission du virus se fait par gouttelettes et contact avec des surfaces d'équipement contaminées ; elles ne confirment pas une transmission courante par voie aéroportée. Une transmission aéroportée peut se produire, comme ce fut le cas pour d'autres maladies respiratoires virales, pendant les actes générant des aérosols (p. ex., intubation endotrachéale, bronchoscopie) ; c'est la raison pour laquelle l'OMS recommande les précautions contre la transmission aéroportée pour ce type d'actes.

L'OMS recommande-t-elle le port systématique de masques pour les personnes en bonne santé pendant la flambée à 2019-nCoV ?,"Non. L'OMS ne recommande pas aux personnes asymptomatiques (c'est-à-dire qui ne présentent pas de symptômes respiratoires) dans la communauté de porter des masques médicaux, car il n'y a actuellement aucun élément de preuve pour affirmer que l'utilisation systématique de masques médicaux par des personnes en bonne santé empêche la transmission du 2019-nCoV. Il est recommandé que les masques soient utilisés par les personnes symptomatiques dans la communauté. La mauvaise utilisation et la surutilisation des masques médicaux peuvent entraîner de graves problèmes de rupture de stock et le manque de disponibilité des masques pour ceux qui doivent vraiment en porter un.  Dans les établissements de santé où des agents de santé dispensent directement des soins à des patients présumés ou confirmés atteints de l'infection respiratoire aiguë à 2019-nCoV, les masques sont un moyen important de contenir la propagation interhumaine du 2019-nCoV, avec les autres EPI et l'hygiène des mains.

Des patients présumés ou confirmés atteints de l'infection à nCoV peuvent-t-ils être regroupés dans la même chambre ?,"Dans l'idéal, les patients présumés ou confirmés atteints de l'infection respiratoire aiguë à 2019-nCoV devraient être isolés dans des chambres individuelles. Toutefois, lorsque cela n'est pas possible (p. ex. lorsque le nombre de chambres individuelles est limité), le regroupement est une option acceptable. Certains patients chez qui l'on suspecte une infection à 2019-nCoV peuvent en fait avoir d'autres maladies respiratoires, c'est pourquoi ceux-là doivent impérativement être regroupés séparément des patients dont l'infection à 2019-nCoV est confirmée. Une distance minimale de 1 mètre entre les lits doit être maintenue à tout moment."
Les patients présumés ou confirmés infectés par le 2019-nCoV doivent-ils être hospitalisés s'ils présentent une symptomatologie bénigne ?,"Non. Pour les patients qui présentent des symptômes bénins, p. ex. fièvre peu intense, toux, malaise général, rhinorrhée, mal de gorge sans signaux d'alerte, tels qu'essoufflement ou difficultés respiratoires, symptômes respiratoires accrus (à savoir, augmentation des expectorations ou hémoptysie), symptômes gastro-intestinaux tels que nausée, vomissements et/ou diarrhée et sans changement dans l'état mental, l'hospitalisation peut ne pas s'imposer, sauf si l'on craint une détérioration clinique rapide. Tous les patients renvoyés chez eux doivent recevoir comme consigne de revenir à l'hôpital s'ils constatent une aggravation de leur état.

"Les hôpitaux spécialisés ou de recours sont-ils obligatoires pour les patients présumés ou confirmés atteints de l'infection à 2019-nCoV, lorsqu'une hospitalisation s'avère nécessaire ?","Non. Les recommandations actuelles de l'OMS ne prévoient pas l'obligation de faire appel exclusivement aux hôpitaux spécialisés ou de recours pour soigner des patients présumés ou confirmés atteints d'une infection respiratoire aiguë à 2019-nCoV. Cependant, les pays ou les juridictions locales peuvent opter pour la prise en charge des patients dans ces types d'hôpitaux si ces derniers sont jugés les plus aptes à prendre en charge en toute sécurité les patients présumés ou confirmés atteints de l'infection respiratoire aiguë à 2019-nCoV, ou pour d'autres raisons cliniques (p. ex., disponibilité de services de réanimation avancée). Quoi qu'il en soit, tout établissement de santé dans lequel sont soignés des patients présumés ou confirmés infectés par le 2019-nCoV doit se conformer aux recommandations de l'OMS en matière de lutte contre les infections afin de protéger les patients, le personnel et les visiteurs. Cliquez ici pour consulter les lignes directrices : https://www.who.int/fr/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control-during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected-20200125."
Quels sont les désinfectants recommandés pour le nettoyage de l'environnement dans les établissements de santé ou les habitations hébergeant des patients présumés ou confirmés atteints de l'infection à 2019-nCoV ?,"Le nettoyage de l'environnement dans les établissements de santé ou les habitations hébergeant des patients présumés ou confirmés atteints de l'infection à 2019-nCoV doit utiliser des désinfectants qui sont actifs contre les virus à enveloppe, tels que le 2019-nCoV et d'autres coronavirus. Il existe de nombreux désinfectants, y compris les désinfectants couramment utilisés dans les hôpitaux, qui sont actifs contre les virus à enveloppe. Les recommandations actuelles de l'OMS préconisent d'utiliser :l'alcool éthylique à 70 % pour désinfecter, entre chaque utilisation, les équipements spécialisés réutilisables (p. ex., les thermomètres)l'hypochlorite de sodium à 0,5 % (équivalent 5000 ppm) pour la désinfection des surfaces fréquemment touchées dans les habitations ou les établissements de santéCliquez ici pour consulter les lignes directrices destinées aux établissements de santé pendant la flambée à 2019-nCoV : https://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected, https://www.who.int/fr/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control-during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected-20200125.Des informations supplémentaires sur le nettoyage de l'environnement (locaux, surfaces et équipements) sont disponibles ici : https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/resource-limited/environmental-cleaning-508.pdf (en anglais)"
Combien de temps le 2019-nCoV peut-il survivre sur une surface sèche ?,"On ne dispose actuellement d'aucune donnée sur la stabilité du 2019-nCoV sur les surfaces. Les données d'études en laboratoire menées sur le SRAS-CoV et le MERS-CoV ont montré que la stabilité dans l'environnement dépend de plusieurs facteurs parmi lesquels la température relative, l'humidité et le type de surface. L'OMS continue à surveiller l'émergence d'éléments probants au sujet du nCoV, et procèdera aux mises à jour à mesure que ces données probantes seront disponibles."
Y a-t-il une procédure spéciale concernant les déchets produits par les patients présumés ou confirmés infectés par le 2019-nCoV ?,"Non. Les déchets produits pendant les soins dispensés en milieu hospitalier ou à domicile aux patients présumés ou confirmés atteints de l'infection à 2019-nCoV doivent être éliminés comme des déchets infectieux. Pour plus d'informations sur l'élimination des déchets infectieux, veuillez cliquer ici :https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/safe-management-of-waste-summary/fr/https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/resource-limited/environmental-cleaning-508.pdf (en anglais)"
Y a-t-il des procédures spéciales pour la prise en charge du corps des personnes décédées de l'infection à 2019-nCoV ?,"Non, il n'existe pas de procédures spéciales pour la prise en charge du corps des personnes décédées de l'infection à 2019-nCoV. Les autorités et les établissements médicaux doivent se conformer aux politiques et réglementations établies qui régissent la prise en charge post-mortem des personnes décédées de maladies infectieuses."
"Existe-t-il un modèle pour la mise en place d'une salle d'isolement, et pour les types de produits et les exigences sanitaires en la matière ?",Un modèle pour mettre en place une salle d'isolement est actuellement en cours d'élaboration. Les spécifications en matière d'EPI pour les agents de santé qui s'occupent de patients infectés par le nCoV figurent dans le guide de matériels et produits médicaux disponible à l'adresse :  https://www.who.int/publications-detail/disease-commodity-package---novel-coronavirus-(ncov) (en anglais)
Les solutions chlorées peuvent-elles aussi être utilisées ?,"Les solutions chlorées sont fortement déconseillées, car elles font courir un risque plus élevé d'irritation des mains et d'effets néfastes sur la santé lors de leur préparation et de leur dilution, notamment une irritation des yeux et des problèmes respiratoires. Elles risquent par ailleurs de perdre leur effet antimicrobien si elles sont exposées à la lumière du soleil ou à la chaleur. Pour préparer des solutions de chlore, il faut un certain entraînement pour obtenir la dose correcte de 0,05 % avec les différentes concentrations d'eau de Javel disponibles dans le secteur privé. Même conservées dans un endroit frais et sec avec un couvercle et à l'abri de la lumière du soleil, elles doivent être renouvelées chaque jour. En comparaison, une simple solution d'eau savonneuse ne présente aucun des risques sanitaires ou complications susmentionnés, notamment la perte de l'effet antiviral sous l'effet de la chaleur ou de la lumière du soleil. L'effet antiviral de l'eau savonneuse est dû au fait que le savon dissout la membrane superficielle huileuse du virus de la COVID-19, ce qui tue le virus."
Qu’est-ce que l’activité physique ?,"L’activité physique englobe toutes lesformes de loisirs actifs, les sports, les déplacements à vélo et àpied, le travail, les activités domestiques et le jardinage. Cen’est pas seulement de l’exercice ou du sport. En effet, le jeu,la danse et même le ménage et le transport de lourds sacs decourses sont des formes d’activité physique.Pendant la pandémie de COVID-19, alors quenous sommes si nombreux à être confinés, il est encore plusimportant pour chacun, quels que soient son âge et ses capacités,d’être aussi physiquement actif que possible. Le fait de se lever,ne serait-ce que trois à cinq minutes, pour marcher ou s’étirerpermet de soulager la tension musculaire et mentale et améliore lacirculation sanguine et l’activité des muscles. Une activitéphysique régulière permet aussi d’établir une routinequotidienne et de rester en contact avec sa famille et ses amis."
Pourquoi avons-nous besoin d’activité physique ?,"Une activité physique régulière estbénéfique tant pour le corps que pour l’esprit. Elle permet demodérer l’hypertension artérielle, de maîtriser son poids et deréduire le risque de cardiopathie, d’accident vasculaire cérébral,de diabète de type 2 et de plusieurs cancers. Elle renforceégalement la solidité des os et la puissance des muscles, améliorel’équilibre et la souplesse et permet de se sentir plus en forme.Chez les personnes âgées, les activités qui améliorentl’équilibre permettent d’éviter les chutes et les traumatismes.Chez l’enfant, une activité physique régulière favorise lacroissance et le développement et réduit le risque de maladie plustard dans la vie. En outre, grâce à une activité physiquerégulière, les enfants peuvent développer leur motricité et avoirdes relations sociales. Une activité physique régulière amélioreaussi la santé mentale et peut réduire le risque de dépression etde déclin cognitif, retarder la survenue d’une démence etaméliorer la sensation générale de bien-être."
Pendant combien de temps est-il recommandé d’avoir une activité physique ?,"L’OMS a formulé des recommandationsdétaillées sur la durée nécessaire d’activité physique, pourtous les âges, afin que celle-ci ait un effet bénéfique sur lasanté et le bien-être.1Les nourrissons de moins d’un an doiventavoir	une activité physique plusieurs fois par jour.Lesenfants de moins de cinq ansdoivent	avoir une activité physique 180 minutes par jour au moins, et les	3-4 ans doivent avoir une activité modérée à intense une heure	par jour.Lesenfants et les adolescents de 5 à 17 ansdoivent	avoir une activité physique modérée à intense au moins 60	minutes par jour et doivent faire des activités pour renforcer les	muscles et les os au moins trois jours par semaine.Lesadultes de plus de 18 ansdoivent	avoir une activité physique modérée 150 minutes par semaine au	total ou avoir une activité physique intense pendant 75 minutes au	cours de la semaine et notamment faire des activités pour renforcer	les muscles deux jours ou plus par semaine.Les	personnes âgées qui ont des problèmes de mobilité doivent faire	une activité physique au moins trois jours par semaine pour	améliorer leur équilibre et éviter les chutes.Toute activité physique est bénéfique.Commencez par une activité physique modérée puis augmentez-enprogressivement la durée, la fréquence et l’intensité.Il est difficile pour nous tous d’avoir uneactivité physique pendant la pandémie de COVID-19. Comme lespossibilités semblent plus limitées, il est d’autant plusimportant de prévoir chaque jour des façons d’être actif et depasser moins de temps assis. Plus simplement, c’est le moment oujamais de bouger plus et de moins rester assis.1	Indiquer la référence des lignes directrices de 2010 et des lignes	directrices de 2018 pour les moins de cinq ans."
Comment rester physiquement actif chez soi ?,"Essayez de ne pas rester assis trop longtemps, que ce soit pour travailler, pour étudier, pour regarder la télé, pour lire, pour consulter les réseaux sociaux ou pour jouer à des jeux sur écran. Faites une pause de 3 à 5 minutes toutes les 20 à 30 minutes. Levez-vous et étirez-vous ou, mieux encore, faites le tour de votre logement, montez et descendez les escaliers ou, si vous le pouvez, allez dans le jardin. En vous déplaçant et en vous étirant, vous pouvez être en meilleure santé et vous sentir mieux. Pour trouver d’autres idées et des exemples d’étirements voir (lien vers le site Web du Bureau régional de l’Europe2 )Faites en sorte d’intégrer l’activité physique dans votre routine quotidienne en prévoyant une activité physique ou une pause active, pour vous tout seul, en suivant un cours en ligne ou encore en ligne avec vos amis ou vos collègues. Réservez un moment de la journée à l’activité physique. Notez-le sur votre agenda pour vous en souvenir. Tenez-vous-y car cela vous permettra d’établir une routine et vous aidera à vous adapter aux nouvelles façons de travailler, d’étudier et de vivre en famille dans le cadre des restrictions imposées par la COVID-19.Faites une activité physique avec votre famille et vos amis. La pratique d’une activité physique peut être une occasion de passer du temps ensemble. Faire une activité physique avec vos enfants (jeux à la maison, promenades dans les parcs ou vélo) peut être un moyen pour toute la famille de se détendre, de se réunir et d’être en bonne santé tout en restant à la maison.Fixez des objectifs pour vous-même et pour votre famille, en choisissant un type d’activité spécifique, un moment de la journée et/ou le nombre de minutes pendant lesquelles vous ferez une activité physique quotidienne. Demandez à chaque membre de la famille de fixer ses propres objectifs, qui doivent être ambitieux mais réalistes, avec l’aide d’autres membres de la famille ou d’amis et en étant motivé. Notez vos progrès sur un tableau d’activité hebdomadaire et, si vous pensez que cela peut vous aider, offrez-vous une récompense.Autres idées d’activités physiquesPour les nourrissons de moins d’un anJouez régulièrement avec votre enfant par terre, sur le ventre, et répartissez les activités tout au long de la journée, quand l’enfant est éveillé.Pour les enfants de moins de cinq ansJouez à la maison et aux alentours – inventez des jeux pour lesquels il faut être actif et qui permettent de développer certaines aptitudes (lancer, attraper, taper dans un ballon) et d’améliorer la posture et l’équilibre.Faites des jeux qui fatiguent les enfants (courir et sauter, par exemple).Pour les enfants et les adolescents de cinq à 17 ansFaites une activité physique ludique en famille.Faites une activité physique ludique ou prenez des cours d’éducation physique en ligne et faites une activité physique routinière adaptée aux adolescents.Faites des jeux de plein air à l’intérieur (saut à la corde, marelle) et inventez de nouveaux jeux et de nouveaux défis qui supposent d’être physiquement actif.Essayez une nouvelle activité – par exemple, apprenez à jongler.Favorisez les activités destinées à renforcer les muscles, par exemple soulever des poids. À défaut de poids, vous pouvez utiliser des bouteilles remplies d’eau ou de sable.Pour les adultesMontez les escaliers autant que vous le pouvez. C’est une forme d’activité physique.Faites le ménage. C’est aussi une occasion d’être plus actif.Amusez-vous. Par exemple, mettez de la musique et dansez.Prenez un cours d’exercice physique en ligne ou mettez la musique que vous aimez et faites travailler vos muscles et augmenter votre fréquence cardiaque.Faites des activités destinées à renforcer les muscles, par exemple soulever des poids. À défaut de poids, vous pouvez utiliser des bouteilles remplies d’eau. Vous pouvez aussi faire des pompes, des relevés du buste et des flexions sur jambes.2 http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-technical-guidance/stay-physically-active-during-self-quarantine/_recache?fbclid=IwAR2RQYVYBnmpDCMjBwqmoz0hZxzmit_9yKzXu6ZhjGNywRTEzWOUQefU8V0."
Comment avoir une activité sans prendre de risques pendant la pandémie de COVID-19 ?,"Encas de fièvre, de toux et de difficultés respiratoires, ne faitespas d’exercice.Restez chez vous,reposez-vous et appelez un médecin. Suivez les instructions desautorités sanitaires locales.Sivous pouvez aller marcher ou faire du vélo, tenez-voustoujours à distance des autres personnes et lavez-vous les mains àl’eau et au savon avant de partir, quand vous arrivez àdestination et dès que vous rentrez chez vous. Si vous n’avez nieau ni savon à disposition immédiatement, utilisez une solutionhydroalcoolique.Sivous allez marcher, courir ou faire de l’exercice dans un parc ouun lieu public à l’air libre,tenez-voustoujours à distance des autres personnes et lavez-vous les mains àl’eau et au savon avant de partir, quand vous arrivez àdestination et dès que vous rentrez chez vous.

Commencez par avoir uneactivité physique pendant cinq à 10 minutes pour atteindreprogressivement 30 minutes en quelques semaines. Quand on n’y estpas habitué, il est préférable et plus sûr d’avoir une activitéphysique pendant de courtes périodes et souvent que pendant delongues périodes.Choisissezune activité qui vous plaît mais adaptée pour réduire le risquede traumatisme.Choisissezune activité adaptée à votre état de santé et à votre formephysique. Vous devez pouvoir respirer sans difficulté et avoir uneconversation pendant que vous faites une activité physiqued’intensité faible à modérée."
Combien de pays touchés par le paludisme ont notifié des cas de COVID-19 ?,"Dans toutes les Régions de l’OMS, des pays où le paludisme est endémique ont notifié des cas de COVID-19. Dans la Région africaine de l’OMS, où se concentre plus de 90 % de la charge palustre, 37 pays, dont 10 avaient signalé une transmission locale, avaient notifié des cas de COVID-19 au 25 mars. Les derniers rapports de situation sur la pandémie de COVID-19 sont disponibles sur le site Web de l’OMS."
Faut-il maintenir les principales interventions de lutte antivectorielle compte tenu de la propagation rapide de la COVID-19 à l’échelle mondiale ?,"Ces derniers jours, on a signalé la suspension de campagnes de distribution de moustiquaires imprégnées d’insecticide (MII) et de pulvérisation d’insecticide à effet rémanent à l’intérieur des habitations dans plusieurs pays africains en raison de craintes d’exposition à la COVID-19. La suspension de ces campagnes représentera pour de nombreuses populations vulnérables, en particulier les jeunes enfants et les femmes enceintes, un risque accru de contracter le paludisme.  L’OMS encourage vivement les pays à ne pas suspendre la planification ou la mise en œuvre des activités de lutte antivectorielle, dont les campagnes de distribution de MII et de pulvérisation d’insecticide à effet rémanent à l’intérieur des habitations, tout en assurant ces services selon les meilleures pratiques pour protéger les agents de santé et les communautés de la COVID-19. Il peut s’avérer nécessaire de modifier les stratégies de distribution prévues pour éviter autant que possible l’exposition au coronavirus.L’Alliance for Malaria Prevention a formulé à l’intention des programmes nationaux de lutte contre le paludisme des recommandations précieuses sur la distribution des MII dans le contexte de la riposte à la COVID-19. Ces recommandations sont conformes aux orientations mondiales de l’OMS. Pour les campagnes de pulvérisation d’insecticide à effet rémanent à l’intérieur des habitations, l’OMS soutient les orientations établies par l’Initiative du Président des États-Unis d’Amérique contre le paludisme dans le contexte de la COVID-19. Ces orientations préconisent notamment que les équipes chargées du déploiement de la pulvérisation installent davantage de points de lavage des mains et mettent à disposition plus de savon dans tous les lieux concernés ; ajoutent aux examens médicaux effectués le matin pour tous les membres des équipes une prise de la température, si possible ; portent un masque N-95 et un équipement de protection individuelle avant d’entrer dans le lieu de la pulvérisation ; et nettoient fréquemment les surfaces (poignées de portes, etc.)  En plus des recommandations ci-dessus, la population doit appliquer les mesures de protection essentielles de l’OMS contre le nouveau coronavirus."
Les traitements préventifs recommandés par l’OMS doivent-ils être maintenus en Afrique subsaharienne ?,"Oui, la délivrance du traitement préventif intermittent pendant la grossesse (TPIg), de la chimioprévention du paludisme saisonnier (CPS) et du traitement préventif intermittent du nourrisson (TPIn) doit être maintenue, en suivant les meilleures pratiques de protection des agents de santé – et des autres intervenants en première ligne – contre la COVID-19.De nouvelles orientations de l’OMS précisent les droits, le rôle et les responsabilités des agents de santé dans le contexte de la COVID-19. L’OMS a également mis au point des orientations pour que les pays puissent continuer à assurer les services de santé essentiels pendant la pandémie."
Les orientations de l’OMS relatives au diagnostic et au traitement du paludisme ont-elles été modifiées ?,Non. Le diagnostic et le traitement précoces du paludisme sont essentiels pour éviter une évolution grave et le décès. Les pays ne doivent pas réduire leurs efforts de détection et de traitement du paludisme car cela risquerait de compromettre gravement la santé et le bien-être de millions de personnes atteintes d’une maladie potentiellement mortelle.
Quelles mesures supplémentaires particulières peuvent être nécessaires dans le contexte de la COVID-19 ?,"En plus des mesures systématiques de lutte contre le paludisme, il peut être judicieux de prendre des mesures particulières dans le contexte de la pandémie de COVID-19 – par exemple, le retour temporaire au traitement présomptif ou le recours à l’administration massive de médicaments – qui se sont révélées utiles lors de situations d’urgence passées. Le traitement présomptif du paludisme est le traitement d’un cas suspect sans confirmation du diagnostic (par exemple, à l’aide d’un test rapide). Cette méthode est utilisée, en général, uniquement dans des situations extrêmes, notamment quand le diagnostic rapide n’est plus possible.  L’administration massive de médicaments est une approche qui permet de faire baisser rapidement la mortalité et la morbidité imputables au paludisme au cours des épidémies dans les situations d’urgence complexes. Tous les membres d’une population cible reçoivent alors des médicaments antipaludiques à intervalles répétés, qu’ils présentent ou non des symptômes de la maladie.Ces mesures particulières doivent être adoptées uniquement pour atteindre objectifs essentiels : faire baisser la mortalité liée au paludisme et assurer la sécurité des agents de santé. L’OMS étudie des propositions concrètes concernant le moment et la manière de mettre en œuvre ces mesures. Des orientations seront publiées en temps utile."
Pourquoi l’OMS est-elle particulièrement préoccupée par la propagation de la COVID-19 dans les régions touchées par le paludisme ?,"Lors de flambées épidémiques précédentes, on a constaté que celles-ci perturbaient la prestation de services de santé et avaient des conséquences sur les maladies telles que le paludisme. Ainsi, la flambée de maladie à virus Ebola qui a sévi de 2014 à 2016 en Guinée, au Libéria et en Sierra Leone, a entravé les efforts de lutte contre le paludisme et a entraîné une forte augmentation de la morbidité et de la mortalité imputables à cette maladie dans ces trois pays.Ces dernières semaines, la pandémie de COVID-19 a mis à l’épreuve la résilience de systèmes de santé solides partout dans le monde. Compte tenu du lourd fardeau que le paludisme fait peser sur les populations vulnérables dans les pays dont le système de santé est fragile, l’OMS souligne qu’il est capital de poursuivre les efforts de prévention, de détection et de traitement du paludisme. Dans toutes les Régions, des mesures de protection doivent être appliquées pour réduire autant que possible le risque de transmission de la COVID-19 entre patients, dans les communautés et parmi les agents de santé. L’OMS a mis au point des orientations détaillées pour les agents de santé dans le contexte de la riposte à la flambée de COVID-19 et des orientations opérationnelles pour continuer à assurer les services de santé essentiels en toute sécurité."
Quels sont les éléments essentiels dont les pays qui tentent d’éliminer le paludisme ou de prévenir la reprise de la transmission doivent tenir compte ?,"Tous les éléments décrits plus haut concernent les pays qui tentent d’éliminer le paludisme ou de prévenir la reprise de la transmission : les efforts doivent se poursuivre pour prévenir, détecter et traiter les cas de paludisme tout en évitant que la COVID-19 ne se propage et en garantissant la sécurité de celles et ceux qui assurent les services. Les pays qui sont près d’éliminer le paludisme doivent préserver leurs acquis précieux et éviter une résurgence de la maladie. Les pays qui ont éliminé le paludisme doivent rester vigilants face à tout cas importé afin d’éviter la réintroduction de la maladie."
La pandémie de COVID-19 a-t-elle perturbé l’approvisionnement en articles essentiels pour lutter contre le paludisme ?,"Oui. Ces derniers jours, on a signalé des perturbations de la chaîne d’approvisionnement en articles essentiels pour lutter contre le paludisme – moustiquaires à imprégnation durable, tests de diagnostic rapide et médicaments antipaludiques, par exemple – dues aux mesures de confinement et de suspension des importations et des exportations de marchandises prises pour faire face à la COVID-19. Il faut mener une action coordonnée afin de garantir la disponibilité d’articles essentiels pour lutter contre le paludisme, en particulier dans les pays où la charge de morbidité est élevée et pour que les efforts déployés en vue de limiter la propagation de la COVID-19 ne compromettent pas l’accès aux services de prévention, de diagnostic et de traitement du paludisme."
Que fait l’OMS pour soutenir les pays touchés par le paludisme dans le contexte de la COVID-19 ?,"L’OMS agit à ses trois niveaux (pays, Régions et Siège) pour que tous les conseils destinés à éviter la propagation du coronavirus et à orienter la prise en charge de la COVID-19 soient adaptés aux pays touchés par le paludisme. L’OMS a également défini, avec ses partenaires, une série de mesures interdépendantes, nécessaires pour atténuer l’impact de la COVID-19 dans les pays les plus durement touchés par le paludisme. L’Organisation a récemment convoqué ses partenaires en vue d’étudier les domaines de collaboration et de coordination pour :produire, utiliser et diffuser des informations exactes ;atténuer les perturbations des systèmes de santé ; etassurer lacontinuité des services normaux de prise en charge du paludisme tout enprenant des mesures supplémentaires particulières dans certains contextes.L’OMS est prête à collaborer avec les pays et d’autres parties prenantes pour atténuer les effets négatifs du coronavirus sur la lutte contre le paludisme dans le monde et, si possible, contribuer au succès de la riposte à la COVID-19."
Quelle est la position de l’OMS sur l’usage de la chloroquine et de l’hydroxychloroquine dans le contexte de la riposte à la COVID-19 ?,"L’OMS suit de près les essais cliniques en cours dans le cadre de la riposte à la COVID-19, y compris les études portant sur l’usage de la chloroquine et de son dérivé, l’hydroxychloroquine, à des fins thérapeutiques et/ou préventives. Les données sont actuellement, insuffisantes pour évaluer l’efficacité de ces médicaments pour traiter les patients atteints de la COVID-19 ou éviter qu’ils ne contractent le coronavirus. À l’heure actuelle, l’OMS recommande la chloroquine pour le traitement du paludisme à P. vivax. Dans le contexte de la riposte à la COVID-19, la posologie et les schémas thérapeutiques actuellement envisagés pour la chloroquine et l’hydroxychloroquine ne correspondent pas à ceux appliqués pour le traitement des patients atteints de paludisme. La prise de ces médicaments à fortes doses peut être associée à des effets indésirables, parfois graves.  Pour les urgences de santé publique, l’OMS prévoit une procédure systématique et transparente de recherche-développement, y compris pour les essais cliniques de médicaments. Le schéma directeur de l’OMS en matière de recherche-développement pour la COVID-19, lancé le 7 janvier 2020, vise à mettre plus vite à disposition des tests, des vaccins et des médicaments efficaces susceptibles de sauver des vies et d’éviter des crises à grande échelle. L’OMS a également défini une série de procédures pour évaluer l’efficacité, la qualité et l’innocuité de technologies médicales en situation d’urgence."
Les personnes vivant avec le VIH risquent-elles davantage d’être infectées par le virus de la COVID-19 ?,"Les personnes vivant avec le VIH qui sont à un stade avancé de la maladie, ont une faible nombre de CD4 et une forte charge virale, ou ne prennent pas de traitement antirétroviral, ont un risque majoré d’infection et, de manière générale, de complications. On ne sait pas si l’immunosuppression liée au VIH rend plus vulnérable à la COVID-19 ; tant que les connaissances ne seront pas plus étendues, toutes les personnes ayant une infection à VIH avancée ou un VIH mal contrôlé devront prendre des précautions supplémentaires.[1],[2]À présent, rien n’indique que le risque d’infection par le virus de la COVID-19, ou de complications de cette maladie, soit différent entre les personnes vivant avec le VIH cliniquement et immunologiquement stables et sous antirétroviral et la population générale. Certaines personnes vivant avec le VIH ont des facteurs de risque connus des complications de la COVID-19, notamment le diabète, l'hypertension et d’autres maladies non transmissibles, et peuvent donc présenter un risque majoré de COVID-19 non liée au VIH. Nous savons que, pendant les épidémies de SRAS et de MERS, seules quelques maladies bénignes ont été rapportées chez des personnes vivant avec le VIH.À ce jour, un cas de personne vivant avec le VIH qui a eu la COVID-19 et en a guéri a été rapporté[3] et une étude de petite taille a été menée sur les facteurs de risque et les antirétroviraux utilisés chez les personnes vivant avec le VIH atteintes de la COVID-19 en Chine. D'après cette étude, les taux de maladie COVID-19 sont les mêmes que dans l’ensemble de la population et le risque croît avec l'âge, mais n’est pas plus élevé chez les sujets qui ont un faible nombre de CD4, ont une forte charge virale ou sont sous traitement antirétroviral.[4] Les données cliniques actuelles tendent à indiquer que les principaux facteurs de risque sont le grand âge et la présence de comorbidités telles que les maladies cardiovasculaires, le diabète, les maladies respiratoires chroniques et l’hypertension. Certaines personnes en très bonne santé ont également développé une maladie sévère due à l’infection à coronavirus.[5]Il est conseillé aux personnes vivant avec le VIH de prendre les mêmes précautions que la population générale, à savoir[6],[7]: se laver souvent les mains ;respecter les règles d’hygiène en cas de toux ;pratiquer l’éloignement physique ;consulter un médecin en cas de symptômes ;observer un auto-isolement si l’on a été en contact avec une personne atteinte de COVID-19 et ; suivre les autres prescriptions des pouvoirs publics.Les personnes vivant avec le VIH qui prennent des médicaments antirétroviraux doivent disposer d’au moins 30 jours de traitement (6 mois au maximum) et être à jour de leurs vaccinations (antigrippales et antipneumococciques). Elles doivent aussi s’assurer d’avoir des stocks suffisants de médicaments pour traiter les co-infections, les comorbidités et l’addiction."
Les antirétroviraux peuvent-ils être utilisés comme traitement de la COVID-19 ?,"Plusieurs études indiquent que les patients infectés par le virus de la COVID-19 ou des infections à coronavirus connexes (SARS-CoV et MERS-CoV) ont généralement une issue clinique favorable, avec une guérison complète presque à chaque fois. Dans certains cas, les patients avaient reçu un médicament antirétroviral : l’association lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). Ces études ont été principalement réalisées chez des sujets séronégatifs pour le VIH.Il est important de relever que les études incluant des associations LPV/r présentaient des limites importantes. Elles étaient de petite taille ; le calendrier, la durée et le dosage des traitement étaient variés et la plupart des patients avaient reçu des co-interventions ou des co-traitements pouvant avoir contribué aux résultats rapportés. Même si l’utilité du recours aux antirétroviraux pour le traitement des infections à coronavirus est très peu étayée, les effets secondaires graves sont apparus rares. Parmi les personnes vivant avec le VIH, l’utilisation systématique du LPV/r comme traitement du VIH est associée à plusieurs effets secondaires de gravité intermédiaire. Cependant, comme la durée du traitement des patients présentant des infections à coronavirus est généralement limitée à quelques semaines, ces effets devraient être rares, ou moins fréquents que dans le cadre d’une utilisation systématique."
Les antirétroviraux peuvent-ils être utilisés pour prévenir l’infection à COVID-19 ?,"Deux études ont été menées sur l’utilisation de l’association LPV/r comme prophylaxie post-exposition pour le SARS-CoV et le MERS-CoV. L’une tend à indiquer que l’infection par le MERS-CoV était moins fréquente chez les agents de santé traités par LPV/r que chez ceux ne recevant aucun médicament. L’autre n’a recensé aucun cas d’infection à SARS-COV chez les 19 personnes vivant avec le VIH hospitalisées dans le même service que des patients infectés par le virus SARS ; parmi elles, 11 étaient sous traitement antirétroviral. Là encore, le degré de fiabilité des données est très faible compte tenu de la petite taille de l’échantillon, de la diversité des médicaments administrés et des incertitudes entourant l’intensité de l’exposition."
Quelles études sont prévues sur le traitement et la prévention de la COVID-19 par antirétroviraux ?,Plusieurs essais randomisés sont prévus pour évaluer l’innocuité et l’efficacité de l’utilisation d’antirétroviraux (principalement l’association LPV/r) pour traiter la COVID-19 en association avec d’autres médicaments. Les résultats devraient être disponibles à partir de la mi-2020.
Quelle est la position de l'OMS concernant l’utilisation des antirétroviraux pour le traitement de la COVID-19 ?,"Les données sont actuellement insuffisantes pour évaluer l’efficacité de l’association LPV/r ou d’autres antirétroviraux pour le traitement de la COVID-19. Plusieurs pays sont en train d’évaluer l’utilisation de l’association LPV/r et d’autres antirétroviraux et nous nous félicitons de bénéficier bientôt du fruit de ces recherches. Une nouvelle fois, dans le cadre de la riposte de l’OMS à l’épidémie, le schéma directeur de l'OMS en matière de R-D a été activé en vue d’accélérer l'évaluation des produits de diagnostic, des vaccins et des produits thérapeutiques contre ce nouveau coronavirus. L’OMS a également élaboré un ensemble de procédures pour évaluer l’efficacité, la qualité et l’innocuité des technologies médicales en situation d’urgence."
Quelle est la position de l’OMS concernant l’utilisation de corticostéroïdes pour traiter la COVID-19 ?,"Dans ses lignes directrices actuelles sur la prise en charge clinique de l’infection respiratoire aiguë sévère lorsqu’une infection par la COVID-19 est soupçonnée, l’OMS déconseille le recours aux corticostéroïdes à moins qu’ils ne soient indiqués pour une autre raison.[8]Ces orientations se fondent sur plusieurs revues systématiques indiquant que le traitement de routine par corticostéroïdes de la pneumonie virale ou du syndrome de détresse respiratoire aigu est peu efficace et pourrait entraîner des effets indésirables.[9]"
"Si les pays utilisent les antirétroviraux contre la COVID-19, les personnes vivant avec le VIH risquent-elles de subir des pénuries de ces traitements ?","Les antirétroviraux sont un traitement efficace et très bien toléré pour les personnes vivant avec le VIH. Des recherches sont en cours afin de déterminer si l’association antirétrovirale LPV/r peut être utilisée contre la COVID-19.  Si ces médicaments viennent à être utilisés contre la COVID-19, un plan doit garantir un approvisionnement suffisant et continu permettant de couvrir les besoins de toutes les personnes vivant avec le VIH qui utilisent déjà l’association LPV/r ou vont devoir entamer ce traitement. Cependant, la proportion de patients traités au moyen de schémas incluant l’association LPV/r est relativement faible, car celle-ci doit être utilisée en deuxième intention selon les lignes directrices de l’OMS sur le traitement du VIH. Tout pays qui autorise l’utilisation de médicaments contre le VIH pour le traitement de la COVID-19 doivent veiller à ce que des stocks suffisants et pérennes soient disponibles."
Comment garantir les droits humains et combattre la stigmatisation et la discrimination ?,"Alors que, partout dans le monde, les pays renforcent leur action de santé publique face à la pandémie de COVID-19, les pays sont instamment appelés à prendre des mesures résolues pour endiguer l’épidémie. L’OMS exhorte tous les pays à trouver l'équilibre qui convient entre la protection de la santé, la prévention des perturbations économiques et sociales et le respect des droits humains. L’OMS collabore avec ses partenaires, notamment l’ONUSIDA et le Réseau mondial des personnes vivant avec le VIH pour empêcher une dégradation des droits humains lors de la riposte à la COVID-19 et pour garantir que les personnes qui vivent avec le VIH ou en subissent les conséquences aient autant accès aux services que les autres et que les services liés au VIH continuent d’être assurés sans être perturbés.Afin d’empêcher que la COVID-19 se propage dans les prisons et de réduire la morbidité et la mortalité chez les personnes qui sont emprisonnées ou vivent dans d’autres milieux clos, il est indispensable que les prisons et les centres de détention d’immigrants soient pris en compte dans l’action de santé publique globale. Pour cela, les ministères de la santé et de la justice doivent collaborer étroitement et des protocoles doivent être mis en place concernant le dépistage à l’entrée, les mesures de protection personnelle, la distanciation physique, le nettoyage et la désinfection du milieu et les restrictions de déplacements, notamment la limitation des transferts et de l’accès des personnels non essentiels et des visiteurs. Dans le contexte actuel, les pays doivent absolument élaborer des stratégies tendant à éviter le recours à la privation de liberté, afin d’empêcher la surpopulation en milieu clos.[10] Cela sera sans doute plus facile si c’est le ministère de la santé, et non le ministère de la justice ou un ministère apparenté, qui gère les questions touchant à la santé en milieu clos.[11]"
Comment les programmes peuvent-ils garantir la continuité d’accès aux services de lutte contre le VIH ?,"Il est important de garantir la continuité d’accès aux services essentiels de prévention, de dépistage et de traitement du VIH, notamment lorsque des mesures de confinement sont prises dans le cadre de l’action de santé publique face à la pandémie de COVID-19. Si l’accès aux services essentiels doit être préservé, il faut aussi envisager et mettre en œuvre des mesures adaptées, reposant sur des bases factuelles, afin de réduire les possibilités de transmission[12]:Appliquer les précautions standard pour l’ensemble des patients (enveillant à ce que, quand ils toussent ou éternuent, tous les patients secouvrent le nez et la bouche avec un mouchoir ou utilisent le creux deleur coude ; en distribuant des masques chirurgicaux aux patients présumésinfectés par le virus de la COVID-19 qui attendent d’être pris en charge ;en respectant les règles d’hygiène des mains, etc.). Les agents de santé et les relais communautaires, ainsi que leséducateurs et les personnes qui bénéficient de leurs services, doiventadopter des règles spécifiques d’hygiène des mains.Des mesures de triage, de détection précoce et de contrôle de lasource infectieuse (isolement des patients présumés infectés par laCOVID-19) doivent être prises.Tout l’établissement de soins doit être correctement ventilé.Idéalement, dans tous les services, la distance entre les patients,quels qu’ils soient, doit être d’au moins 1 mètre. Les procédures de nettoyage et de désinfection doivent êtresystématiquement et correctement appliquées. Les médicaments (contre le VIH, latuberculose et d’autres affections chroniques telles que la dépendance auxopioïdes) doivent être délivrés pour de plus longues périodes afin deréduire la fréquence des visites. Envisager de limiter l’offre auxservices de traitement et de prévention essentiels (les séances de conseilpeuvent être réduites ou adaptées).Généralement, les populations vulnérables, notamment les membres des populations clés ainsi que les sans-abri et les personnes déplacées, risquent davantage d’être infectées, en raison de l’impact des comorbidités sur leur système immunitaire, des difficultés qu’elles rencontrent à appliquer les mesures de confinement et de distanciation physique, et de leur accès généralement limité aux services de santé. Il est essentiel que les services destinés à ces populations (par exemple, services communautaires et de proximité ou centres d’accueil) puissent continuer d’assurer la prévention (distribution de préservatifs, d’aiguilles ou de seringues), le dépistage et le traitement, qui sont des activités vitales, tout en protégeant la sécurité du personnel et des clients. Ces services peuvent être adaptés à la lumière des considérations ci-dessus, le cas échéant."
Pourquoi prescrire et délivrer plusieurs mois de traitement pour les antirétroviraux et les autres médicaments ?,"Les sujets cliniquement stables – adultes, enfants, adolescents, femmes enceintes et allaitantes et membres des populations clés (consommateurs de drogues par injection, travailleurs du sexe, hommes ayant des rapports sexuels avec d’autres hommes, personnes transgenres et personnes vivant dans des prisons ou des milieux clos) – auront avantage à utiliser des modèles de traitement antirétroviral simplifiés prévoyant une prescription et une délivrance sur plusieurs mois (3 à 6 mois). Ces modèles réduiront la fréquence des visites en cadre clinique et permettront d’assurer la continuité du traitement si les déplacements étaient affectés pendant l’épidémie de coronavirus. De même, les sujets cliniquement stables ayant un traitement de substitution à la méthadone ou à la buprénorphine devraient avoir plus souvent la possibilité de suivre leur traitement à domicile, afin de réduire la pression sur le secteur de la santé."
Les femmes vivant avec le VIH peuvent-elles transmettre le virus de la COVID-19 à leur enfant pendant la grossesse ou lors du post-partum ?,"Peu de données sont disponibles sur la présentation clinique de la COVID-19 dans certaines populations, comme les enfants et les femmes enceintes,[13] mais les résultats d’une étude de petite taille publiéetendent à indiquer qu’il n’y a aujourd’hui aucune preuve d’infection intra-utérine par transmission verticale chez les femmes qui développent une pneumonie COVID-19 en fin de grossesse.[14] Même si aucune transmission verticale n'a été documentée, la transmission après la naissance par contact avec des sécrétions respiratoires infectieuses est un motif d’inquiétude. Les nourrissons dontla mère est un cas suspect, probable ou confirmé de COVID-19 doivent être nourris suivant les orientations standard sur l’alimentation du nourrisson,[15] tout en appliquant les précautions nécessairesde lutte anti-infectieuse. Comme tous les cas confirmés ou suspects de COVID-19, les mères symptomatiques qui allaitent, pratiquent le peau-à-peau ou appliquent la méthode « mère kangourou »doivent respecter les règles d’hygiène respiratoire, y compris pendant qu’elles nourrissent leur enfant (notamment, si elles ont des symptômes respiratoires, en portant un masque médical quand elles sont àproximité de l’enfant), se laver les mains avant et après tout contact avec l’enfant, et nettoyer et désinfecter systématiquement les surfaces avec lesquelles elles ont été en contact.[16]Questions-réponse sur la COVID-19, la grossesse, l’accouchement et l’allaitement"
Les femmes enceintes et allaitantes vivant avec le VIH et atteintes de la COVID-19 et leurs nouveau-nés doivent-ils être pris en charge de manière différente ?,"Il n’y a actuellement aucune différence connue entre les manifestations cliniques de la COVID-19 ou le risque de maladie grave (ou de danger grave pour le fœtus) chez les femmes enceintes et les femmes non enceintes ou chez les adultes en âge de procréer. Les femmes qui sont enceintes ou qui ont été enceintes récemment chez qui la COVID-19 est présumée ou confirmée doivent bénéficier de soins d’accompagnement ou de prise en charge, en tenant compte des adaptations immunologiques et physiologiques pendant et après la grossesse, qui pourraient se recouper avec les symptômes de la COVID-19. Les données sont limitées mais, tant que les connaissances disponibles n’apporteront pas d’informations plus claires, une attention particulière devra être accordée aux femmes enceintes présentant d’autres affections et susceptibles d’avoir été infectées par la COVID-19. Aucun décès n'a été rapporté chez les femmes enceintes au moment de la publication de ces informations,[17] cependant, un dépistage de la COVID-19 devrait être effectué en priorité chez les femmes enceintes symptomatiques afin de leur donner accès aux soins spécialisés. Toutes les femmes ayant été enceintes récemment qui sont atteintes de la COVID-19 ou ont guéri de cette maladie doivent bénéficier d’informations et de conseils sur l’alimentation en toute sécurité du nourrisson et sur les mesures de lutte anti-infectieuse pour prévenir la transmission du virus de la COVID-19.[18]En cas de maladie confirmée et pour les sujets sous investigation, la prise en charge est la même que pour les femmes non enceintes, avec un isolement approprié. Les services d’obstétrique doivent être avertis et se préparer, sachant que chaque nouveau-né dont la mère est un cas confirmé de COVID-19 doit être considéré comme une « personne sous investigation » devant être isolée suivant les orientations sur la lutte anti-infectieuse. Actuellement, on ne sait pas si les nouveau-nés atteints de COVID-19 présentent un risque accru de complications sévères."
Les fumeurs et les consommateurs de tabac sont-ils exposés à un risque accru de contracter la COVID-19 ?,"Les fumeurs sont sans doute plus vulnérables face à la COVID-19 car lorsque l'on fume, les doigts (et potentiellement les cigarettes contaminées) sont en contact avec les lèvres, ce qui augmente la possibilité de transmission du virus de la main à la bouche. En outre, les fumeurs pourraient déjà être atteints d'une affection respiratoire ou présenter une capacité pulmonaire insuffisante, ce qui augmenterait considérablement le risque de maladie grave.Les produits du tabac tels que les pipes à eau nécessitent souvent le partage des embouts et des tuyaux, facilitant ainsi la transmission de la COVID-19 dans les milieux communautaires et sociaux. Les conditions favorisant les besoins en oxygène ou réduisant la capacité de l'organisme à l'utiliser correctement exposeront les patients à un risque accru d'affections pulmonaires graves telles que la pneumonie."
Les femmes enceintes sont-elles plus exposées au risque de contracter la COVID-19 ?,"Des recherches sont actuellement en cours pour comprendre les effets de l’infection par le virus de la COVID-19 sur les femmes enceintes. Les données sont peu abondantes, mais rien ne prouve actuellement que les femmes enceintes courent un risque plus élevé que le reste de la population de développer une forme grave de la maladie.Cependant, du fait des bouleversements que subissent leur corps et leur système immunitaire, nous savons que les femmes enceintes peuvent être gravement touchées par certaines infections respiratoires. Il est donc important qu’elles prennent des précautions pour se protéger contre la COVID-19 et qu’elles signalent les symptômes éventuels (tels que fièvre, toux ou difficultés à respirer) à leur prestataire de soins de santé.L’OMS continuera de réviser et d’actualiser ses informations et ses conseils à mesure que de nouvelles données seront disponibles."
Je suis enceinte. Comment puis-je me protéger contre la COVID-19 ?,"Les femmes enceintes doivent prendre les mêmes précautions que les autres personnes pour éviter l’infection par le virus de la COVID-19. Pour se protéger, il faut :Se laver fréquemment les mains avec une solution hydroalcoolique ou à l’eau et au savon.Éviter les contacts proches, se tenir à distance des autres personnes et éviter les endroits bondés.Éviter de se toucher les yeux, le nez et la bouche.Respecter les règles d’hygiène respiratoire. Se couvrir la bouche et le nez avec le pli du coude ou avec un mouchoir en cas de toux ou d’éternuement. Puis jeter le mouchoir usagé immédiatement après.En cas de fièvre, de toux et de difficultés respiratoires, consultez un médecin sans tarder. Téléphonez avant de vous rendre dans un établissement de santé et suivez les instructions des autorités sanitaires locales.Les femmes enceintes et les femmes qui viennent d’accoucher - y compris celles qui sont touchées par la COVID-19 - doivent se rendre à leurs consultations médicales habituelles."
Les femmes enceintes doivent-elles faire un test de dépistage de la COVID-19 ?,"Les protocoles et les critères de dépistage diffèrent selon l’endroit où vous vivez.Cependant, l’OMS recommande de dépister en priorité les femmes enceintes présentant des symptômes de la COVID-19. Si le test se révèle positif, elles peuvent avoir besoin de soins spécialisés."
La COVID-19 peut-elle se transmettre d’une femme à son enfant à naître ou à son nouveau-né ?,"Nous ne savons toujours pas si une femme enceinte ayant la COVID-19 peut transmettre le virus au fœtus pendant la grossesse ou au bébé pendant l’accouchement. À ce jour, la présence du virus n’a pas été constatée dans les échantillons de liquide amniotique ou de lait maternel."
Quels soins devraient être disponibles pendant la grossesse et l’accouchement ?,"Toutes les femmes enceintes, y compris celles dont l'infection par le virus de la COVID-19 est confirmée ou soupçonnée, ont droit à des soins de qualité avant, pendant et après l'accouchement. Cela englobe les soins prénatals, les soins aux nouveau-nés, les soins postnatals, les soins pernatals et les soins de santé mentale.Pour une expérience positive et sans risque de l'accouchement, il faut:Être traitée avec respect et dignité ;Être accompagnée par la personne de son choix pendant l'accouchement ;Une communication claire de la part du personnel de la maternité ;Des solutions adaptées pour soulager la douleur ;De la mobilité pendant le travail, si possible, et la possibilité de choisir la position dans laquelle accoucher.En cas d'infection ou de suspicion d'infection par le virus de la COVID-19, les agents de santé doivent prendre toutes les précautions qui s'imposent afin de réduire les risques d'infection pour eux-mêmes et pour les autres, notamment en suivant une bonne hygiène des mains et en utilisant des vêtements de protection appropriés tels que gants, blouse et masque."
Les femmes enceintes chez qui la présence du virus de la COVID-19 est suspectée ou confirmée doivent-elles accoucher par césarienne ?,"Non. Selon l’OMS, les césariennes ne doivent être pratiquées que si elles sont justifiées pour des raisons médicales.Le mode d’accouchement doit être individualisé et reposer sur les préférences de la femme, ainsi que sur les indications obstétricales."
Les femmes touchées par la COVID-19 peuvent-elles allaiter ?,"Oui. Les femmes touchées par la COVID-19 peuvent allaiter si elles le souhaitent. Elles doivent :Respecter les règles d’hygiène respiratoire, pendant l’allaitement, porter un masque, si possible ;Se laver les mains avant de toucher le bébé et après ;Nettoyer et désinfecter régulièrement les surfaces qu’elles ont touchées."
Puis-je toucher mon nouveau-né et le prendre dans mes bras si j’ai la COVID-19 ?,"Oui. Un contact étroit et un allaitement maternel exclusif et précoce aident le nouveau-né à bien se développer. On doit vous aider àAllaiter votre bébé en toute sécurité, en respectant les règles d’hygiène respiratoire ;Tenir votre nouveau-né peau contre peau etPartager la chambre de votre bébéVous devez vous laver les mains avant de toucher le bébé et après, et garder toutes les surfaces propres."
J’ai la COVID-19 et je ne me sens pas assez bien pour allaiter mon bébé directement. Que puis-je faire ?,"Si vous êtes trop malade pour allaiter votre bébé en raison de la COVID-19 ou d’autres complications, vous devez être aidée à donner à votre bébé du lait maternel en toute sécurité, d’une manière réalisable, disponible et acceptable pour vous. Par exemple :Tirage de lait ;Reprise de l’allaitement (relactation) ;Recours à du lait de nourrice."
Quelles sont les similitudes entre le virus de la COVID-19 et celui de la grippe ?,"Premièrement, le virus de la COVID-19 et celui de la grippe donnent un tableau clinique similaire, marqué par des manifestations respiratoires. La symptomatologie est très variée : tandis que certains sujets sont asymptomatiques ou ont des symptômes bénins, d’autres présentent des manifestations graves voire décèdent.Deuxièmement, les deux virus se transmettent par contact, par les gouttelettes respiratoires et par les contages. Il est donc important que chacun prenne les mêmes mesures de santé publique (hygiène des mains et hygiène respiratoire consistant à tousser dans le pli du coude ou dans un mouchoir que l’on jette immédiatement après usage) afin de prévenir l’infection."
Quelles sont les différences entre le virus de la COVID-19 et celui de la grippe ?,"La vitesse de transmission est une différence importante entre les deux virus. Pour la grippe, la période d’incubation (le délai qui s’écoule entre l’infection et l’apparition des symptômes) médiane et l’intervalle sériel (le délai qui s’écoule entre les cas successifs) sont plus courts que pour la COVID-19. Pour la COIVD-19, l’intervalle sériel est estimé à cinq à six jours tandis que pour la grippe l’intervalle sériel est de trois jours. La grippe peut donc se propager plus rapidement que le COVID-19.En outre, la transmission au cours des trois à cinq premiers jours suivant l’apparition de la maladie ou éventuellement la transmission du virus avant l’apparition des symptômes représente une part importante de la transmission de la grippe. En revanche, si nous savons que certaines personnes peuvent excréter le virus de la COVID-19 24 à 48 heures avant l’apparition des symptômes, cela ne semble pas être un facteur important de transmission.On estime que le taux de reproduction – le nombre d’infections secondaires provoquées par un individu infecté – pour le virus de la COIVD-19 est 2 fois à 2,5 fois plus élevé que pour celui de la grippe. Cependant, les estimations pour le virus de la COVID-19 et celui de la grippe dépendent beaucoup du contexte et de paramètres temporels, ce qui rend les comparaisons plus difficiles.Les enfants sont des vecteurs importants de transmission du virus de la grippe dans leur entourage. Pour le virus de la COVID-19, les premières données indiquent que les enfants sont moins touchés que les adultes et que les taux d’attaque cliniques chez les 0-19 ans sont bas. D’autres données préliminaires tirées d’études sur la transmission au sein des ménages en Chine semblent montrer que les enfants sont infectés par les adultes, plutôt que l’inverse.La symptomatologie est similaire pour les deux infections virales mais la proportion de cas sévères ne semble pas être la même. Pour la COVID-19, les données disponibles à ce jour semblent indiquer que 80 % des infections sont bénignes ou asymptomatiques, 15 % sont graves et nécessitent une oxygénothérapie, tandis que 5 % sont critiques et exigent une assistance respiratoire. La proportion de cas sévères et critiques serait plus élevée que ce que l’on observe pour la grippe.Les sujets les plus exposés à une infection grippale grave sont les enfants, les femmes enceintes, les personnes âgées, les personnes atteintes de maladies chroniques et les personnes immunodéprimées. Pour la COVID-19, nous pensons actuellement que l’âge et les pathologies sous-jacentes accroissent le risque de manifestations sévères. Pour la COVID-19, la mortalité semble plus élevée que pour la grippe, en particulier la grippe saisonnière. Il faudra un certain temps pour avoir une idée précise de la mortalité attribuable à la COVID-19, mais les données dont nous disposons à ce jour indiquent que le taux brut de mortalité (le nombre de décès notifiés divisé par le nombre de cas notifiés) est de 3 % à 4 %, tandis que le taux de mortalité dû à l’infection (le nombre de décès notifiés divisé par le nombre d’infections) sera plus faible. Pour la grippe saisonnière, la mortalité est généralement inférieure à 0,1 %. Cependant, la mortalité est déterminée en grande partie par l’accès aux soins de santé et par la qualité des soins."
Quelles sont les interventions médicales disponibles contre la COVID-19 et contre la grippe ?,"Plusieurs traitements font actuellement l’objet d’essais cliniques en Chine et plus de 20 vaccins contre la COVID-19 sont en cours de mise au point mais il n’y a actuellement aucun vaccin ou traitement homologué contre cette maladie. En revanche, il existe des antiviraux et des vaccins contre la grippe. Le vaccin antigrippal n’est pas efficace contre le virus de la COVID-19 mais il est vivement recommandé de se faire vacciner chaque année pour éviter de contracter la grippe."
Что такое коронавирус?,"Коронавирусы составляют обширное семейство вирусов с доказанными болезнетворными свойствами по отношению к человеку или животным. Известно, что ряд коронавирусов способен вызывать у человека респираторные инфекции в диапазоне от обычной простуды до болеесерьезных состояний, таких как ближневосточный респираторный синдром (БВРС) и тяжелый острый респираторный синдром (ТОРС). Последний из недавно открытых коронавирусов вызывает заболевание COVID‑19."
Что такое COVID-19?,"COVID‑19 – инфекционное заболевание, вызванное последним из недавно открытых коронавирусов. До вспышки инфекции в Ухане, Китай, в декабре 2019 г. о новом вирусе и заболевании ничего не было известно."
Каковы симптомы COVID‑19?,"К наиболее распространенным симптомам COVID‑19 относятся повышение температуры тела, утомляемость и сухой кашель. У ряда пациентов могут отмечаться различные боли, заложенность носа, насморк, фарингит или диарея. Как правило, эти симптомы развиваютсяпостепенно и носят слабо выраженный характер. У некоторых инфицированных лиц не возникает каких-либо симптомов или плохого самочувствия. У большинства людей (порядка 80%) болезнь заканчивается выздоровлением, при этом специфических лечебных мероприятийне требуется. Примерно в одном из шести случаев COVID-19 возникает тяжелая симптоматика с развитием дыхательной недостаточности. У пожилых людей, а также лиц с имеющимися соматическими заболеваниями, например, артериальной гипертензией, заболеваниямисердца или диабетом, вероятность тяжелого течения заболевания выше. При наличии повышенной температуры тела, кашля и затрудненного дыхания следует обращаться за медицинской помощью."
Как распространяется вирус?,"Заразиться 2019‑nCoV можно от других людей, если они инфицированы вирусом. Заболевание может передаваться от человека к человеку через мелкие капли, выделяемые из носа или рта больного COVID‑19 при кашле или чихании. Эти капли попадают на окружающие человекапредметы и поверхности. Другие люди могут заразиться в результате прикосновения сначала к таким предметам или поверхностям, а затем – к глазам, носу или рту. Кроме того, заражение может произойти при вдыхании мелких капель, которые выделяютсяпри кашле или чихании человека с COVID‑19. По этой причине важно держаться от больного человека на расстоянии более 1 метра. ВОЗ отслеживает ход исследований по вопросу о путях передачи COVID-19 и будет публиковать информацию по мере ее обновления."
"Передается ли вирус, вызывающий COVID-19, через воздух?","Согласно актуальным научным данным более весомым фактором передачи, чем воздух, являются именно мелкие капли, выделяемые из дыхательных путей. См. ответ на предыдущий вопрос «Как распространяется вирус?»"
"Можно ли заразиться COVID-19 от человека, у которого не наблюдается никаких симптомов?","Вирус в основном распространяется через капли, выделяемые из дыхательных путей человека при кашле или чихании. Риск заражения от человека, не имеющего никаких симптомов, крайне низок. С другой стороны, у многих людей симптомы COVID-19 бывают выраженыочень слабо. Это особенно характерно для ранних стадий заболевания. Таким образом, риск передачи COVID-19 от человека, который не чувствует себя больным и имеет только слабый кашель, существует. ВОЗ отслеживает ход текущих исследований по вопросуоб интервале времени, в течение которого больной человек остается заразным, и будет публиковать информацию по мере ее обновления."
Могу ли я заразиться COVID-19 через фекалии больного человека?,"По-видимому, риск заражения 2019-nCoV через фекалии инфицированного человека мал. Согласно данным предварительных исследований вирус в ряде случаев может быть обнаружен в фекалиях, однако подобный механизм передачи не играет ведущей роли в нынешней вспышкезаболевания. ВОЗ изучает результаты продолжающихся исследований в отношении передачи COVID-19 и будет публиковать информацию по мере ее обновления. Подобный риск нельзя полностью сбросить со счетов, и это еще раз подтверждает важность регулярногомытья рук после пользования туалетом и перед приемом пищи."
Как я могу защитить себя и предотвратить распространение заболевания?,"Меры индивидуальной защиты для всех. Следите за актуальной информацией о вспышке, которую можно найти на веб‑сайте ВОЗ, а также получить от национальных и локальных представителей служб общественного здравоохранения. Во многих странах мира зарегистрированы случаи заражения COVID‑19, а внекоторых — вспышки заболевания. Властям Китая, а также ряда других стран, в которых были зафиксированы вспышки, удалось замедлить распространение заболевания или полностью его остановить. Тем не менее ситуация по-прежнему непредсказуема, всвязи с чем следует оставаться в курсе последних событий. Соблюдая простые меры предосторожности, вы можете снизить риск заражения или распространения COVID‑19: Регулярно обрабатывайте руки спиртосодержащим средством или мойте их с мылом. Зачем это нужно? Если на поверхности рук присутствует вирус, то обработка рук спиртосодержащим средством или мытье их с мылом убьет его. Держитесь на расстоянии не менее одного метра от кашляющих или чихающих людей.Зачем это нужно? При кашле или чихании из носа или рта выделяются мельчайшие содержащие вирус капли, которые человек распространяет вокруг себя. Находясь слишком близко к такому человеку, вы рискуете вдохнуть эти капли изаразиться от него, в том числе коронавирусной инфекцией, если человек болен COVID-19. По возможности, не трогайте руками глаза, нос и рот.Зачем это нужно? Руки касаются многих поверхностей, и на них может попасть вирус. Оказавшись на руках, вирусные частицы могут попадать в глаза, нос или рот. С этих частей телавирус может внедряться в организм и вызывать заболевание. Как вам, так и окружающим следует строго соблюдать правила респираторной гигиены. Для этого необходимо прикрывать рот или нос сгибом локтя или салфеткой при кашле или чихании. Использованную салфетку нужно сразу же выбросить.Зачем это нужно? Вирус передается через мелкие капли. Строго соблюдая правила респираторной гигиены, вы можете защитить окружающих от таких вирусных заболеваний, как ОРВИ, грипп и COVID-19. Если вы плохо себя чувствуете, оставайтесь дома. При повышении температуры, появлении кашля и затруднении дыхания как можно быстрее обращайтесь за медицинской помощью. Следуйте указаниям местных органов здравоохранения. Зачем это нужно? У центральных и местных органов здравоохранения имеется самая актуальная информация о ситуации в районе вашего проживания. Своевременное обращение за медицинской помощью позволит медицинским специалистам оперативно направить вас в подходящее лечебноеучреждение. Кроме того, вы тем самым обезопасите себя и поможете предотвратить распространение вирусных и других инфекций. Следите за обновлением списка зон высокого риска по COVID‑19 (города или районы, в которых отмечено широкое распространение COVID‑19). По возможности воздержитесь от поездок, особенно если вы являетесь пожилым человеком или страдаете диабетом, заболеваниямисердца или легких.  Зачем это нужно? В этих районах вы подвергнете себя повышенному риску заражения COVID‑19. Меры индивидуальной защиты для тех, кто недавно (за последние 14 дней) посещал регионы распространения COVID‑19. Следуйте рекомендациям, представленным выше («Меры индивидуальной защиты для всех») Если вы почувствовали недомогание, оставайтесь дома до выздоровления, даже если у вас слабо выраженные симптомы заболевания, например головная боль, субфебрильная температура (37,3°C или выше) или небольшой насморк. Если вы просите кого-то приноситьвам продукты и ходить за вас в магазин, пользуйтесь маской, чтобы не заразить приходящего к вам человека. Зачем это нужно? Воздерживаясь от контакта с окружающими и не посещая лечебные учреждения, вы помогаете этим учреждениямработать эффективнее и защищаете себя и окружающих от возможного заражения COVID-19 или другими вирусными инфекциями. Если у вас повышенная температура тела, кашель и затруднение дыхания, не откладывайте обращение за медицинской помощью, так как эти симптомы могут быть вызваны респираторной инфекцией или другим серьезным заболеванием. Немедленно обращайтесь в медицинскоеучреждение и сообщите медицинскому специалисту обо всех последних поездках или контактах с путешествующими людьми.Зачем это нужно? Своевременное обращение за медицинской помощью позволит медицинским специалистам оперативнонаправить вас в подходящее лечебное учреждение. Кроме того, это поможет профилактике вероятного распространения COVID-19 и других вирусных инфекций."
Насколько мне стоит опасаться заражения COVID‑19?,"Для большинства людей в большинстве регионов риск заражения COVID‑19 по‑прежнему мал. Тем не менее в некоторых частях мира (городах или районах) заболевание продолжает распространяться. Риск заражения выше для тех, кто проживает в таких районах или посещаетих. Правительства стран и органы управления здравоохранением принимают энергичные меры реагирования на каждый новый случай заражения COVID‑19. При наличии введенных на местном уровне ограничений на поездки, передвижение или массовые мероприятия соблюдайтеэтот режим. Поддерживая меры по контролю за распространением заболевания, вы можете сократить риск заражения или распространения COVID‑19. Как свидетельствует пример Китая и ряда других стран, в наших силах ограничить распространение вспышек заболевания и остановить передачу инфекции. К сожалению, вспышки могут быстро возникать в новых очагах. Важно оставаться в курсе обстановки в вашемрегионе или регионе, который вы планируете посетить. ВОЗ ежедневно публикует обновленные сводки о текущей эпидемиологической обстановке по COVID‑19 во всем мире. Эти сведения доступны по адресу https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/ (на английском языке)."
Является ли COVID‑19 предметом для беспокойства?,"Как правило, коронавирусная инфекция COVID‑19 протекает в легкой форме, в особенности у детей и лиц молодого возраста. Тем не менее существует тяжелая форма инфекции: примерно в одном из пяти случаев заболевшим необходима госпитализация. Поэтому беспокойстволюдей за себя и близких в связи со вспышкой COVID‑19 оправдано. Мы можем направить наши усилия в конструктивное русло и принять меры по защите собственного здоровья, здоровья наших близких и людей в нашей общине. Самой главной и первоочередной мерой является регулярное и тщательное мытье рук, а также соблюдение правилреспираторной гигиены. Во‑вторых, необходимо следить за развитием событий и придерживаться рекомендаций местных органов управления здравоохранением, в том числе соблюдать введенные ими ограничения на поездки, передвижение или массовые мероприятия.Информация о мерах предосторожности для защиты от инфекции доступна по адресу https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public."
Кому угрожает риск тяжелого течения болезни?,"Наши сведения о COVID‑19 еще не полны, но, по-видимому, тяжелое течение болезни чаще отмечается у пожилых людей, а также у людей с имеющимися соматическими заболеваниями (например, артериальной гипертензией, заболеваниями сердца, легких, раком или диабетом)."
Являются ли антибиотики эффективным средством профилактики и лечения инфекции 2019‑nCoV?,"Нет. Антибиотики не действуют на вирусы, они активны только в отношении бактериальных инфекций. Заболевание COVID‑19 имеет вирусную природу, поэтому антибиотики неэффективны. Не следует пользоваться антибиотиками для профилактики или лечения COVID‑19.Их применение допускается только по назначению врача для лечения бактериальной инфекции."
"Имеются ли в настоящее время лекарственные препараты или терапия, позволяющие предупреждать или лечить COVID-19?","Ряд средств западной медицины, а также традиционных народных или домашних средств может способствовать улучшению самочувствия и облегчению симптомов заболевания COVID-19, тем не менее, в настоящее время нет фактических данных, которые бы могли свидетельствоватьо том, что действие какого либо из имеющихся препаратов позволяет предотвратить или лечить данное заболевание. ВОЗ не рекомендует проводить самолечение с помощью каких бы то ни было лекарственных препаратов, включая антибиотики, с целью профилактикиили лечения инфекции COVID-19. В то же время ведутся клинические испытания ряда средств как западной, так и традиционной народной медицины. ВОЗ продолжит публиковать обновленные сведения по мере появления клинических данных."
"Это тот же вирус, который вызывает атипичную пневмонию (ТОРС)?","Следует ли мне носить маску, чтобы защитить себя? Вам следует носить маску только в том случае, если у вас есть симптомы COVID‑19 (особенно кашель) или если вы осуществляете уход за человеком, который может быть болен COVID‑19. Одноразовые маски нельзя использовать повторно. Если у вас нет симптомовзаболевания или вы не осуществляете уход за заболевшим человеком, использование маски будет нерациональным. В настоящее время в мире отмечается дефицит масок, поэтому ВОЗ призывает всех к бережливому использованию. ВОЗ выступает за рациональное применение медицинских масок, позволяющее избежать расходования ценных ресурсов, а также неправильного использования масок (см. Рекомендации по применению масок). К числу наиболее эффективных мер защиты собственного здоровья и здоровья окружающих от COVID‑19 относится частое мытье рук, прикрывание носа и рта сгибом локтя или салфеткой при кашле, а также поддержание дистанции не менее 1 метра с людьми, которые кашляютили чихают. Более подробные сведения представлены в разделе об основных мерах предосторожности для защиты от новой коронавирусной инфекции."
"Как надевать, использовать, снимать и утилизировать маску","Использовать маску следует только медицинским работникам, лицам, осуществляющим уход, и лицам с симптомами респираторного заболевания, такими как высокая температура и кашель.Перед тем как взять маску в руки, обработайте их спиртосодержащим средством или вымойте с мылом.Осмотрите маску, чтобы убедиться в отсутствии прорех и повреждений.На маске имеется металлическая вставка, возьмите маску вставкой вверх.Расположите маску внешней стороной от себя (ярко окрашенная сторона).Наденьте маску на лицо. Изогните металлическую вставку или фиксирующий зажим по форме носа.Потяните за нижний край маски, чтобы она закрыла рот и подбородок.Снимите маску после применения; удерживайте маску за эластичные заушные петли и не прикасайтесь ею к лицу или одежде, так как использованная маска может быть загрязнена микроорганизмами. Сразу после использования выбросьте маску в закрывающийся контейнер.После прикосновения к маске или ее выбрасывания следует произвести гигиеническую обработку рук: воспользуйтесь спиртосодержащим средством, а при очевидном загрязнении рук вымойте их с мылом."
Сколько длится инкубационный период COVID‑19?,"Инкубационный период – это период времени между заражением и появлением клинических симптомов болезни. Согласно большинству оценок, продолжительность инкубационного периода COVID‑19 колеблется в пределах от 1 до 14 дней и чаще всего составляет околопяти дней. Эти оценки будут уточняться по мере поступления новых данных."
Может ли человек заразиться COVID-19 от животного?,"Коронавирусы составляют обширное семейство вирусов и широко распространены у животных. Заражение людей этими вирусами с последующей передачей другим людям происходит время от времени. Например, установлен факт заражения людей ТОРС‑КоВ от цивет, а БВРС‑КоВ– от одногорбых верблюдов. Возможный источник 2019‑nCoV среди животных пока не установлен. В качестве меры индивидуальной защиты, например, при посещении рынков, на которых торгуют живностью, следует избегать непосредственного контакта с животными, а также касания поверхностей, с которыми соприкасаются животные. Следует строго соблюдать правилаобеспечения безопасности продуктов питания. При работе с сырым мясом, молоком, органами животных следует проявлять осторожность во избежание перекрестного загрязнения других продуктов, не прошедших термическую обработку, и, кроме того, следует воздерживатьсяот употребления сырых или полусырых продуктов животного происхождения."
Могу ли я заразиться COVID‑19 от домашнего животного?,"ВОЗ продолжает проводить тщательный мониторинг результатов новых исследований, посвященных как данному, так и другим аспектам COVID‑19, и будет публиковать обновленные результаты по мере их появления."
Как долго вирус выживает на поверхностях?,"Длительность выживания вируса 2019‑nCoV на поверхностях пока точно не установлена, однако предполагается, что по этому параметру он схож с другими представителями семейства коронавирусов. По данным исследований (включая предварительные о возбудителе COVID-19),вирус сохранять жизнеспособность на поверхностях от нескольких часов до нескольких дней. Конкретные сроки зависят от ряда условий (например, тип поверхности, температура и влажность окружающей среды). Если вы подозреваете, что на какой-то поверхности может присутствовать вирус, для уничтожения микроорганизмов и защиты себя и окружающих обработайте ее обычным дезинфицирующим средством. Не забывайте обрабатывать руки спиртосодержащим средством или мытьих с мылом. Не прикасайтесь к глазам, рту или носу."
"Безопасно ли получать посылки из района, в котором зарегистрированы случаи заболевания COVID-19?","Да. Вероятность того, что инфекция может передаваться от заболевшего человека через заказанные товары, низка, равно как и риск заражения вирусным возбудителем COVID-19 от упаковки, которая подвергалась перемещению, перевозке и находилась под воздействиемразличных погодных и температурных условий."
Чего мне не следует делать?,"Нижеперечисленные меры НЕ ПОМОГАЮТ бороться с COVID‑19 и могут причинить вред: курение;одновременное ношение нескольких масок; антибиотики  (см. Имеются ли в настоящее время лекарственные препараты или терапия, позволяющие предупреждать или лечить COVID-19? ). Если у вас высокая температура, кашель и затрудненное дыхание, то для уменьшения риска осложнения инфекции необходимо как можно быстрее обратиться за медицинской помощью и сообщить медицинскому специалисту о посещенных за последнее времяместах.

"Сколько человек должно участвовать во встрече или мероприятии, чтобы они считались массовыми?","К массовым мероприятиям относятсякрупнейшие международные спортивныесоревнования, такие как Олимпийскиеигры или чемпионаты мира, а такжемеждународные религиозные мероприятия,например, паломничество мусульман вМекку — Хадж. Однако согласноопределению ВОЗ, в число массовых могуттакже входит конференции и мероприятияменьшего масштаба. Мероприятие считаетсямассовым, если численность его участниковнастолько велика, что может превыситьвозможности местной системы здравоохраненияпо организации и предоставлениюмедицинских услуг. При этом следуетпринимать во внимание не только количествоучастников, и но место проведения ипродолжительность мероприятия. Например,если многодневное мероприятие с участиемвсего лишь нескольких тысяч человекпроводится на территории малогоостровного государства в условияхограниченных возможностей системыздравоохранения, оно может крайнезатруднить работу медицинских служб ибудет рассматриваться как массовое. Сдругой стороны, к категории массовыхможет не относиться мероприятие,проводимое в течение нескольких часовв крупном городе страны с хорошо развитойи современной системой здравоохранения."
Рекомендует ли ВОЗ отменить все международные массовые мероприятия в связи с COVID-19?,"Нет. Международные массовые мероприятияотличаются друг от друга, и решениевопроса об отмене или проведениимероприятия может также зависеть отсамых различных факторов. Любые решенияоб изменении запланированного порядкапроведения международного мероприятиядолжны приниматься исходя из всестороннейоценки тяжести существующих рисков ивозможностей их контроля, а такжекачества подготовки мероприятия.В проведении такой оценки должныпринимать участие все заинтересованныестороны, и в особенности органыздравоохранения страны или населенногопункта, в котором планируется организоватьмероприятие. Эти органы и заинтересованныестороны лучше всего способны оценитьстепень потенциальной нагрузкимероприятия на местную системуздравоохранения и работу экстренныхслужб и определить, является ли такаянагрузка приемлемой в существующейситуации."
"Какие факторы должны учесть организаторы мероприятий и органы здравоохранения, принимая решение о приемлемости или неприемлемости рисков?","В странах, в которых в настоящее время не отмечено циркуляции коронавируса среди населения, необходимо прежде всего ответить на вопрос о том, может ли планируемое массовое мероприятие значительно увеличитьриск привнесения вирусной инфекции и ее дальнейшей передачи на территории страны, а также повысить опасность завоза инфекции участниками мероприятия в свои родные страны и, как следствие, ускорить распространение инфекции во всем мире. Изучая данныйвопрос, организаторы мероприятия и национальные или местные органы общественного здравоохранения должны иметь в виду, что международные поездки неизбежно сопровождаются риском завоза случаев COVID-19. Они также должны понимать, что нереалистично инецелесообразно пытаться свести данный риск к нулю. Решая вопрос о проведении массового мероприятия, организаторы и органы здравоохранения должны определить уровень допустимого риска и дополнительные меры, необходимые для его снижения.В странах, в которых уже зафиксировано начало циркуляции коронавируса среди населения, следует учитывать следующие важные принципы:необходимость	сдержать или по меньшей мере замедлить	распространение вирусной инфекции в	пределах общин или всей страны;необходимость	предупредить заражение COVID-19 иностранных	участников.В каждом случае риск следует оценивать с учетом известных особенностей COVID-19, тяжести ее течения, заразности, а также эффективности мер по профилактике или снижению темпов передачи инфекции. Кроме того, необходимо принять во внимание уже существующуюнагрузку на местную систему здравоохранения в связи с реагированием на вспышку (вспышки) COVID-19 и дополнительную нагрузку, которую может создать проведение мероприятия.Более подробную информацию о критериях принятия таких решений можно найти в документе ВОЗ «Ключевые рекомендации относительно планирования массовых мероприятий в контексте текущей вспышки COVID-19» от 14 февраля 2020 г. по адресуhttp://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/429697/RUS_Key-planning-recommendations-for-mass-gatherings-in-the-context-of-COVID-19_tRu.pdf."
"Что если в нашей организации нет специалистов, умеющих оценить риски, которые представляет COVID‑19 для запланированного нами массового мероприятия?","Грамотно оценить риски для здоровьяобычно могут национальные или местныеорганы общественного здравоохранениястраны, в которой вы планируете провестимассовое мероприятие. Некоторуюэкспертную поддержку в данном вопросеможет предоставить страновое бюро ВОЗ,если оно имеется. То же самое можносказать о региональном бюро ВОЗ, ккоторому относится страна. Перечень иконтактные данные региональных бюроВОЗ имеются по адресуhttps://www.who.int/ru/about/who-we-are/regional-offices."
"Если мы приняли решение не отменять международное массовое мероприятие, что мы можем сделать для снижения риска передачи COVID‑19 участникам?","Пропагандируйте гигиену рук, респираторнуюгигиену и соблюдение безопаснойдистанции. Получите от каждого участникаконтактные данные для экстренной связи,в том числе о месте его проживания вовремя мероприятия. Предупредите участникао том, что эти сведения будут переданыв местные органы общественногоздравоохранения для оперативногоотслеживания контактных лиц в случаепоявления больных COVID‑19 средиучастников мероприятия. Организаторымероприятия должны согласовать планобеспечения готовности на случайвозникновения симптомов COVID‑19 уодного или нескольких участников. Ондолжен определять порядок оперативнойизоляции и безопасной доставки заболевшегов местное медицинское учреждение.Необходимо предусмотреть возможностьограничения числа присутствующих намероприятии за счет проведениявидеотрансляции или телеконференциии, возможно, контроля симптомов COVID‑19(кашель, лихорадка, недомогание) на входев зону проведения мероприятия.

"Требуется ли медицинским работникам, оказывающим помощь пациентам с подозрением на инфекцию 2019-nCoV или с подтвержденной инфекцией 2019-nCoV, в обязательном порядке носить средства индивидуальной защиты (СИЗ), такие как бахилы, непромокаемый фартук или защитный комбинезон?","Нет. В действующем руководстве ВОЗ по уходу за пациентами с  подозрением на острое респираторное заболевание, вызванное вирусом 2019-nCoV, или с подтвержденной инфекцией 2019-nCoV приводятся рекомендации по использованию средств защиты от контактной и воздушно-капельной передачи инфекций в дополнение к стандартным мерам предосторожности, которые должны систематически приниматься всеми медработниками, работающими с любыми пациентами. К СИЗ, которые следует использовать для защиты от инфекций, передаваемых контактным и аэрогенным путем, относятся одноразовые перчатки, а также чистые нестерильные медицинские халаты с длинным рукавом, закрывающие одежду медработника, медицинские маски, прикрывающие рот и нос, а также защита для глаз (например, очки или экран). Эти средства необходимо надевать перед входом в палату, где находятся пациенты с острым респираторным заболеванием, вызванным вирусом 2019-nCoV (с подозрением на заражение или с подтвержденным заражением). Респираторы (например, типа N95) необходимо использовать только при выполнении процедур, ведущих к образованию аэрозолей. Рекомендации по применению СИЗ медицинскими работниками при оказании помощи пациентам с подозрением на инфекцию 2019-nCoV или с подтвержденной инфекцией 2019-nCoV размещены по этой ссылке: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control-during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected (на английском языке)."
Можно ли стерилизовать и повторно использовать одноразовые медицинские маски?,"Нет. Одноразовые медицинские маски предназначены только для однократного использования. Использованную маску необходимо правильно снять (т.е. снять за завязки или резинки сзади, не прикасаясь к передней поверхности маски) и немедленно утилизировать, выбросив ее в контейнер для инфекционных отходов с крышкой, после чего обработать руки антисептиком или вымыть с мылом.  Рекомендации по применению масок в контексте вспышки коронавирусной инфекции 2019-nCoV размещены по этой ссылке: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-health-care-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak (на английском языке).Почему ВОЗ рекомендует медицинским работникам, оказывающим помощь пациентам с подозрением на инфекцию 2019-nCoV или с подтвержденной инфекцией 2019-nCoV, применять средства защиты от контактной и воздушно-капельной передачи инфекции и не рекомендует систематически использовать средства защиты от воздушно-пылевой передачи инфекции? Краткие рекомендации ВОЗ были разработаны на основе консенсуса международных экспертов, проанализировавших имеющиеся на текущий момент научные данные относительно механизмов передачи вируса 2019-nCoV. Эти данные указывают на то, что вирус передается воздушно-капельным путем и через контакт с зараженными поверхностями оборудования и приспособлений; о систематической передаче вируса воздушно-пылевым путем данных нет. Известно о способности других респираторных вирусных заболеваний передаваться воздушно-пылевым путем, например, в результате выполнения процедур, приводящих к образованию аэрозолей (например, интубации трахеи, бронхоскопии), в связи с чем ВОЗ рекомендует при выполнении таких процедур применять средства защиты от воздушно-пылевой передачи инфекции. Рекомендации для медицинских работников о мерах защиты от 2019-nCoV размещены по этой ссылке: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control-during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected (на английском языке)."
Рекомендует ли ВОЗ повседневное ношение масок здоровым людям в условиях вспышки 2019-nCoV?,"Нет. ВОЗ не рекомендует людям, у которых отсутствуют симптомы заболевания (т.е. респираторные симптомы), носить медицинские маски, поскольку на данный момент свидетельств того, что систематическое использование медицинских масок здоровыми людьми позволяет предотвратить передачу вируса 2019-nCoV, нет. Маски рекомендуется использовать негоспитализированным лицам с симптомами заболевания. Неправильное и чрезмерное использование медицинских масок может привести к их серьезному дефициту, в результате чего масок будет не хватать тем, кому их действительно необходимо носить. В медицинских учреждениях, где медицинские работники работают непосредственно с пациентами с подозрением на инфекцию или подтвержденной инфекцией 2019-nCoV, ношение медицинских масок наряду с другими средствами индивидуальной защиты и соблюдением правил гигиены рук являются одним из необходимых средств профилактики распространения острого респираторного заболевания, вызванного вирусом 2019-nCoV. Более подробные рекомендации по использованию медицинских масок доступны по этой ссылке: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-health-care-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak (на английском языке).Можно ли размещать пациентов с подозрением на инфекцию 2019-nCoV или с подтвержденным диагнозом по нескольку человек в одной палате? В идеальном случае, пациентов с подозрением на острое респираторное заболевание, вызванное вирусом 2019-nCoV, следует изолировать в одноместных палатах. Однако если это невозможно (например, в случае нехватки свободных одноместных палат), допускается совместное размещение таких пациентов в одной палате. Некоторые пациенты с подозрением на инфекцию 2019-nCoV могут на самом деле болеть другими респираторными заболеваниями, поэтому их не следует смешивать с пациентами с подтвержденной инфекцией 2019-nCoV. При совместном размещении пациентов расстояние между койками должно составлять не менее 1 метра."
"Следует ли госпитализировать пациентов с подозрением на инфекцию или подтвержденной инфекцией 2019-nCoV, если заболевание протекает в легкой форме?","Нет. Пациенты с легким течением болезни, например субфебрильной температурой тела, кашлем, недомоганием, насморком или болью в горле без наличия тревожных симптомов, таких как одышка или затрудненное дыхание, увеличение секреции дыхательных путей (т.е. отделение мокроты или кровохарканье), желудочно-кишечных симптомов, например тошноты, рвоты и/или диареи, а также без нарушений сознания, подлежат госпитализации только при наличии опасений в связи с возможным быстрым ухудшением их состояния. Все выписанные пациенты должны быть проинструктированы о том, что при появлении любых признаков ухудшения состояния им необходимо вновь обратиться в больницу. Дополнительная информация о показаниях для госпитализации доступна по этой ссылке: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected (на английском языке).

В случае необходимости госпитализации пациентов с подозрением на инфекцию 2019-nCoV или с подтвержденной инфекцией 2019-nCoV следует ли их помещать в специализированные больницы или медицинские учреждения?,"Нет. Текущие рекомендации ВОЗ не содержат указаний о необходимости госпитализации пациентов с подозрением на острое респираторное заболевание, вызванное вирусом 2019-nCoV, или с подтвержденным диагнозом исключительно в специализированные больницы. Тем не менее, страны или местные органы власти могут принять решение о направлении таких пациентов в специализированные лечебные учреждения, если там существуют наиболее благоприятные условия для безопасного оказания медицинской помощи лицам с подозрением на инфекцию 2019-nCoV или с подтвержденной инфекцией 2019-nCoV, или исходя из других клинических соображений (например, в связи с наличием в таких больницах передового оборудования для интенсивной терапии). Так или иначе, любое лечебное учреждение, в котором оказывается помощь пациентам с подозрением на инфекцию 2019-nCoV или с подтвержденной инфекцией 2019-nCoV, должно обеспечить выполнение рекомендаций ВОЗ по инфекционному контролю в интересах защиты здоровья пациентов, персонала и посетителей. Соответствующие рекомендации размещены по этой ссылке: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control-during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected-20200125 (на английском языке)."
"Какие дезинфицирующие средства рекомендуется использовать для обработки помещений в лечебных учреждениях или стационарах, в которых госпитализированы пациенты с подозрением на инфекцию 2019-nCoV или с подтвержденной инфекцией 2019-nCoV?","Для уборки и дезинфекции помещений в лечебных учреждениях или стационарах, в которых госпитализированы пациенты с подозрением на инфекцию 2019-nCoV или с подтвержденной инфекцией 2019-nCoV, следует использовать дезинфицирующие средства, активные по отношению к оболочечным вирусам, к которым относятся вирус 2019-nCoV и прочие коронавирусы. Таких дезинфицирующих средств множество, включая широко используемые в лечебных учреждениях. В настоящее время ВОЗ рекомендует использовать следующие средства: для дезинфекции многоразового инструмента (например, термометров) перед каждым новым использованием: спирт этиловый 70%;для дезинфекции поверхностей, к которым часто прикасаются персонал или пациенты, на дому или в лечебных учреждениях: натрия гипохлорит 0,5%.

Как долго вирус 2019-nCoV сохраняет жизнеспособность на сухих поверхностях?,"На данный момент данные о стабильности вируса 2019-nCoV на поверхностях отсутствуют.  Данные лабораторных исследований ТОРС-КоВ и БВРС-КоВ показывают, что стабильность этих коронавирусов в окружающей среде зависит от ряда факторов, включая относительные температуру и влажность, а также материал поверхности. ВОЗ продолжает сбор и анализ имеющихся данных о nCoV и будет публиковать обновленную информацию по мере ее поступления."
Предусмотрены ли специальные процедуры утилизации отходов больных с подозрением на инфекцию 2019-nCoV или с подтвержденной инфекцией 2019-nCoV?,"Нет. Отходы, образующиеся в результате оказания помощи пациентам с подозрением на инфекцию 2019-nCoV или с подтвержденной инфекцией 2019-nCoV на дому или в лечебном учреждении, должны утилизироваться в соответствии с обычными процедурами утилизации инфекционных отходов. Дополнительная информация об утилизации инфекционных отходов доступна по этим ссылкам: https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/safe-management-of-waste-summary/ru/ https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/resource-limited/environmental-cleaning-508.pdf (на английском языке)."
"Предусмотрены ли специальные процедуры обращения с телами пациентов, умерших от 2019-nCoV?","Нет. Специальные процедуры обращения с телами пациентов, умерших от 2019-nCoV, не предусмотрены. Органы власти и медицинские учреждения должны следовать установленным правилам и нормативным положениям, регулирующим порядок обращения с телами лиц, умерших от инфекционных заболеваний."
Существует ли проект типовой палаты-изолятора и перечень необходимых материалов и соответствующих санитарно-эпидемиологических условий и требований?,"Инструкции по обустройству палат-изоляторов в настоящее время находятся в стадии подготовки. Технические спецификации на СИЗ, необходимые для использования медицинским персоналом, работающим с пациентами с nCoV, размещены по адресу: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/disease-commodity-package---novel-coronavirus-(ncov) Каковы рекомендации относительно использования хлорной извести для гигиены и дезинфекции рук и борьбы с nCoV? Слабый раствор хлорной извести (0,05%) может использоваться для дезинфекции рук в случае отсутствия спиртосодержащих составов для обработки рук или мыла. Тем не менее, при наличии антисептиков на спиртовой основе или возможности вымыть руки водой с мылом слабый раствор хлорной извести использовать не рекомендуется, поскольку при приготовлении раствора хлорной извести возникает повышенный риск раздражения кожи и других неблагоприятных проявлений. Кроме того, раствор хлорной извести необходимо готовить ежедневно и хранить в холодном, сухом и темном месте, в противном случае он потеряет свои дезинфицирующие свойства. Хлорная известь (раствор 0,5%) –  эффективное средство для дезинфекции поверхностей при условии предварительной очистки поверхностей водой с мылом."
Что такое физическая активность?,"Физическаяактивность включает в себя все формыактивного отдыха, занятия спортом, ездуна велосипеде и ходьбу пешком, а такжеактивность на работе, во время работыпо дому и в саду. Это не обязательнодолжны быть физические упражнения илизанятия спортом, это могут быть игры,танцы, садоводство и даже уборка домаи походы по магазинам – все это частьфизической активности.Во время пандемииCOVID-19, когдамногие из нас сильно ограничены в своихпередвижениях, еще более важно, чтобылюди всех возрастов и возможностей быликак можно более активными. Даже короткийперерыв, чтобы встать и сделать физическиеупражнения, такие как ходьба или растяжка,поможет ослабить мышечную нагрузку,снять умственное напряжение, улучшитькровообращение и повысить мышечнуюактивность. Регулярная физическаяактивность также может помочь справитьсяс повседневными делами и станет ещеодной возможностью для общения с семьейи друзьями."
Зачем это надо?,"Регулярнаяфизическая активность полезна как вфизическом, так и в психологическомотношении. Она может способствоватьснижению кровяного давления, помогатьрегулировать вес и уменьшать рисквозникновения болезней сердца, инсульта,диабета второго типа и различных видоврака. Она также укрепляет кости и мышцыи развивает равновесие, повышает гибкостьи улучшает общее физическое состояние.Физические упражнения, улучшающиеравновесие, помогают пожилым людямпредотвратить падения и травмы. Благодарярегулярным физическим упражнениям детиразвиваются и растут здоровыми, снижаетсяриск возникновения заболеваний впоследующие периоды жизни и, кроме того,регулярная физическая активностьпомогает детям развивать основныедвигательные навыки и налаживатьотношения в обществе. Регулярнаяфизическая активность также способствуетулучшению психического здоровья и можетуменьшить риск возникновения депрессии,снижения когнитивных функций и отсрочитьнаступление деменции, а также улучшитьобщее самочувствие."
Какой рекомендуется уровень физической активности?,"ВОЗ публикуетподробные рекомендации по вопросу обуровне физической активности, необходимомдля людей всех возрастов с тем, чтобыона способствовала поддержанию здоровьяи благополучия1.Вот минимальные уровни, которые мырекомендуем: детив возрасте до одного года должны:быть	физически активными несколько раз в	день;детив возрасте до пяти лет:должны	заниматься физически активной	деятельностью не менее 180 минут в	день, при этом дети в возрасте	трех-четырех лет должны заниматься	физическим упражнениями со средней	или высокой нагрузкой один час в день;детии подростки в возрасте 5–17 лет:все	дети и подростки не менее трех раз в	неделю должны не менее одного часа в	день заниматься физическими упражнениями	со средней или высокой интенсивностью,	в том числе упражнениями, укрепляющими	мышцы и кости;взрослые старше 18 лет:должны	отводить в общей сложности не менее	150 минут на физические упражнения	средней интенсивности или не менее	75 минут на физические упражнения	высокой интенсивности в течение всей	недели, в том числе дважды в неделю или	чаще – на упражнения по укреплению	мышц;пожилые	люди с ограниченной мобильностью должны	выполнять физические упражнения для	развития равновесия и профилактики	падений три раза в неделю и более.Однако любаяфизическая активность лучше, чем ееотсутствие. Начинайте с небольшойнагрузки и с течением времени постепенноувеличивайте ее продолжительность,частоту и интенсивность. Поддержаниефизической активности во время пандемииCOVID-19 –сложная задача для всех. Посколькувозможности для физической активности,как представляется, уменьшились, ещеболее важное значение приобретаетежедневное планирование занятий дляповышения физической активности исокращение времени пребывания в сидячемположении. Проще говоря, настало время,когда мы должны больше двигаться именьше сидеть.1https://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_recommendations/ru/"
Как обеспечить свою безопасность во время физических упражнений в условиях COVID-19?,"Не занимайтесь физическими упражнениями, если у вас температура, кашель или затрудненное дыхание. Останьтесь дома и отдохните, обратитесь за медицинской помощью, при этом предварительно позвоните. Следуйте рекомендациям местных органов здравоохранения. Если есть возможность совершить пешую или велосипедную прогулку, всегда соблюдайте с другими людьми дистанцию и мойте руки водой с мылом перед выходом, а также, когда дошли или доехали до намеченного места, и сразу по возвращении домой. Если вода и мыло отсутствуют, протирайте руки спиртосодержащим средством. Если идете гулять, бегать или заниматься физическими упражнениями в парк, всегда соблюдайте с другими людьми дистанцию и мойте руки водой с мылом перед выходом, а также, когда дошли или доехали до намеченного места, и сразу по возвращении домой. Если вода и мыло отсутствуют, протирайте руки спиртосодержащим средством. Следуйте рекомендациям местных органов здравоохранения в том, что касается любых ограничений в отношении числа находящихся в одном и том же месте людей и/или пользования инвентарем для игр и физических упражнений на открытом воздухе в общественных местах. Если вы не занимаетесь физическими упражнениями регулярно, то начинайте это делать постепенно и с низкой интенсивностью, например совершайте пешие прогулки и делайте легкие физические упражнения. Начните с занятий небольшой продолжительностью, примерно по 5–10 минут, и постепенно увеличивайте ее до 30 минут и более в течение нескольких недель. Лучше и безопаснее выполнять физические упражнения частыми и короткими сериями, чем стараться увеличить их продолжительность, если вы к этому не привыкли. Правильно выбирайте физические упражнения, чтобы уменьшить риск травматизма и получить удовольствие от занятий. Правильно выбирайте интенсивность нагрузки в зависимости от состояния здоровья и уровня физической подготовки. Во время физических упражнений низкой и средней интенсивности вы должны сохранять комфортное дыхание и способность говорить без напряжения."
"Как поддерживать физическую активность, находясь дома и рядом с ним?","Старайтесьсократить время, которое проводите вположении сидя,будь то в процессе работы, учебы, просмотрателевизионных передач, чтения книг,общения в социальных сетях или в случае,если вы играете в компьютерные игры.Сократите время длительного пребыванияв сидячем положении и каждые 20–30 минутделайте короткие перерывы по 3–5 минут.Просто встаньте и потянитесь или лучшепрогуляйтесь по дому, вверх-вниз полестнице, или саду.

"Сколько стран, затронутых малярией, зарегистрировали у себя случаи COVID-19?","СлучаиCOVID-19 зарегистрированы в эндемичных помалярии странах во всех регионах ВОЗ.По состоянию на 25 марта пациенты сCOVID-19 выявлены в 37 странах Африканскогорегиона ВОЗ, на долю которого приходитсяболее 90% глобального бремени малярии,из них в 10 странах зафиксированапередача болезни среди местногонаселения. На веб-сайте ВОЗ можно найтипоследниеоперативные сводки о ситуации с пандемиейCOVID-19."
Следует ли продолжать основные мероприятия по борьбе с переносчиками малярии на фоне быстрого распространения COVID-19 во всем мире?,"Впоследние дни поступают сообщения отом, что в нескольких странах Африкииз-за опасений по поводу передачиCOVID-19 были приостановлены кампании пораспространению обработанных инсектицидомпротивомоскитных сеток (ОИС) и распылениюинсектицидов остаточного действиявнутри помещений (РИОДВП). Приостановкатаких кампаний подвергнет повышенномуриску малярии многочисленные уязвимыегруппы населения, особенно детей младшеговозраста и беременных женщин. ВОЗнастоятельно рекомендует непрерывать процесспланирования и реализации мероприятийпо борьбе с переносчиками, включаякампании по распространению ОИС иРИОДВП, и использовать в ходе такихмероприятий передовыеметоды защиты от COVID-19 работниковздравоохраненияиместного населения. Для сведения кминимуму вероятности заражениякоронавирусом может быть необходимоскорректировать запланированныестратегии по распространению средствзащиты. Альянспо предупреждению малярии выпустилценные рекомендациидлянациональных противомалярийных программпо вопросам распространения ОИС вусловиях реагирования на COVID-19; этирекомендации согласуются с глобальнымируководящими принципами ВОЗ.ВОЗподдерживает рекомендации по проведениюкампаний распространения ОИС, разработанныев США Президентской инициативой поборьбе с малярией в условиях пандемииCOVID-19. Они, в частности, содержат следующиерекомендации для распространяющих ОИСбригад: увеличить число пунктов мытьярук с мылом на всех объектах проведениямероприятий; усилить режим проведенияутренних осмотров всех членов бригад,дополнив их, по возможности, измерениемтемпературы; перед прибытием на объектынадевать маски N-95 и средства индивидуальнойзащиты; и обеспечить частую санобработкувсех часто трогаемых поверхностей(дверных ручек, поручней в автотранспортеи т.д.).Вдополнение к указанным выше рекомендациямследует соблюдать рекомендуемыеВОЗ меры по защитездоровьянаселения."
Следует ли продолжать рекомендованную ВОЗ медикаментозную профилактику малярии в странах Африки к югу от Сахары?,"Да,проведение интермиттирующейпрофилактической терапии во времябеременности (ИПТб), сезоннойхимиопрофилактики малярии (СХПМ) иинтермиттирующей профилактическойтерапии младенцев (ИПТм) следуетпродолжатьпри условии соблюдения передовыхметодов защитыработников здравоохранения и другихработников первичного звена от COVID-19.Обеспечение доступности этих и другихбазовых услуг по профилактике маляриипозволяет спасать жизни людей и являетсяважной предпосылкой для сокращениянагрузки на системы здравоохранения вусловиях борьбы с COVID-19.В новыхрекомендациях ВОЗ излагаются права,распределение функций и обязанностейработниковздравоохранения в связи с распространениемCOVID-19. ВОЗ также разработала рекомендациидля стран по обеспечению непрерывногооказания основныхуслуг здравоохранениявпериод пандемии."
Изменились ли рекомендации ВОЗ в отношении диагностики и лечения малярии?,"РекомендацииВОЗ остались без изменения. Решающеезначение имеют ранняя диагностика илечение, помогающие предупредитьосложнение легких форм малярии и смертьпациентов. Странам неследует сокращать объем мероприятийповыявлению и лечению пациентов с малярией;это может иметь тяжелые последствиядля здоровья и благополучия миллионовлюдей, заразившихся этой потенциальноопасной для жизни болезнью."
Какие дополнительные специальные меры могут потребоваться в связи с распространением COVID-19?,"В условияхпандемии COVID-19 может быть целесообразнымдополнить обычные меры борьбы с маляриейспециальными мерами, которые положительнозарекомендовали себя в ряде предыдущихчрезвычайных ситуаций, в частностивременно возобновить презумптивноелечение малярии и массовое назначениелекарственных средств. Презумптивноелечение малярии означает лечениепациента с подозрением на малярию,проводимое в отсутствие возможностиподтвердить заболевание диагностическимисредствами (например, при помощидиагностического экспресс-теста). Обычнотакой подход применяется лишь вэкстремальных ситуациях, например, прираспространении болезни в условияхотсутствия доступа к услугамэкспресс-диагностики.Массовоеназначение лекарственных средств —рекомендованный ВОЗ метод быстрогосокращения смертности и заболеваемостиот малярии в периоды эпидемий и сложныхчрезвычайных ситуаций. При массовомназначении лекарственных средствпротивомалярийные препараты предоставляютсявсем представителям целевой группынаселения, нередко несколько раз,независимо от того, имеются у них симптомызаболевания или нет. Подобныеспециальные меры следует принимать,только тщательно оценив возможностьдостижения двух ключевых целей: снижениясмертности от малярии и обеспечениябезопасности работников здравоохранения.ВОЗ рассматривает конкретные предложенияо том, когда и каким образом должныприниматься такие меры; в дальнейшемна этот счет будут выпущены соответствующиерекомендации."
Почему ВОЗ особенно обеспокоена распространением COVID-19 в затронутых малярией районах?,"Опытпредыдущих вспышек болезнейпродемонстрировал их дестабилизирующеевоздействие на работу медицинских служби негативные последствия для борьбы стакими болезнями, как малярия. Так,вспышка Эболы, произошедшая в 2014–2016 гг.в Гвинее, Либерии и Сьерра-Леоне, серьезноосложнила проведение противомалярийныхмероприятий и привела к значительномуросту заболеваемости малярией исмертности от нее в этих трех странах.Впоследние недели пандемия COVID-19 сталапроверкой на прочность для системздравоохранения во всем мире. С учетомсерьезных последствий малярии дляуязвимых групп населения в странах снестабильно функционирующими системамиздравоохранения, ВОЗ подчеркиваеткритическую важность продолжения усилийпо профилактике, выявлению и лечениюмалярии. Во всех регионах должныприниматься меры защиты, призванныесвести к минимуму риск передачи COVID-19между пациентами, местным населениеми медицинским персоналом. ВОЗ разработалаподробные рекомендациидля работников здравоохраненияв условиях реагирования на вспышкуCOVID-19, а также практическиерекомендациипообеспечению непрерывной работы основныхмедицинских служб при соблюдениитребований безопасности."
"Каковы основные рекомендации для стран, принимающих меры для элиминации малярии или предупреждения ее повторной передачи?","Всеизложенные выше рекомендации касаютсястран, стремящихся элиминировать маляриюили предупредить возвращение болезни:следует продолжать усилия по профилактике,выявлению и лечению случаев малярии,одновременно предупреждая распространениеCOVID-19 и обеспечивая безопасностьработников соответствующих служб.Страны, вплотную подошедшие к элиминациималярии, должны защищать свои важныезавоевания и избегать эпизодов повторногораспространения малярии. Элиминировавшиемалярию страны должны сохранятьбдительность на предмет возможногозавоза случаев малярии во избежаниереинтродукции инфекции."
Вызвала ли пандемия COVID-19 перебои глобальных поставок основных средств для борьбы с малярией?,"Да. Впоследние дни поступают сообщения отом, что введение карантинных мер иприостановка импорта и экспорта грузовв связи с распространением COVID-19 вызываютперебои в работе цепочек поставкиосновных средств для борьбы с малярией,таких как пропитанные инсектицидомсетки долгосрочного действия,диагностические экспресс-тесты ипротивомалярийные препараты. Дляобеспечения доступности ключевыхсредств для борьбы с малярией, особеннов странах с тяжелым бременем заболевания,недопущения перебоев в доступе к услугампрофилактики, диагностики и лечениямалярии, вызванных мероприятиями посдерживанию COVID-19, требуются скоординированныедействия."
Что делает ВОЗ для поддержки затронутых малярией стран в условиях пандемии COVID-19?,"Всетри уровня ВОЗ (страны, регионы иштаб-квартира) участвуют в обеспечениитого, чтобы любые рекомендации,направленные на предупреждениераспространения коронавирусной инфекциии организацию мер по борьбе с COVID-19, моглиприменяться в районах, затронутыхмалярией. Совместнос партнерами ВОЗ также определилакомплекс взаимосвязанных мер, необходимыхдля уменьшения последствий COVID-19 встранах с наиболее тяжелой ситуациейпо малярии. В последнее время Организациявзаимодействует с партнерами дляобсуждения возможных областейсотрудничества и координации усилий вцелях: сбора,	использования и распространения	достоверной информации; ликвидации	последствий перебоев в работе систем	здравоохранения; обеспечения	непрерывности запланированной	деятельности по борьбе с малярией	наряду с принятием в некоторых случаях	дополнительных специальных мер.ВОЗготова взаимодействовать со странамии другими заинтересованными сторонамидля уменьшения негативных последствийкоронавирусной пандемии для мероприятийпо борьбе с малярией во всем мире и, повозможности, одновременного содействияуспешным мерам по противодействиюCOVID-19."
Какова позиция ВОЗ по вопросу о применении в рамках борьбы с COVID-19 хлорохина и гидроксихлорохина?,"ВОЗпристально отслеживает проводящиесяв настоящий момент клинические испытаниясредств для борьбы с COVID-19, в том числеисследования, посвященные лечебному ипрофилактическому применению хлорохинаи его производного гидроксихлорохина.В настоящее время не имеется достаточныхданных, позволяющих судить об эффективностикаждого из этих лекарственных средствдля лечения пациентов с COVID-19 илипредупреждения их инфицированиякоронавирусом. Внастоящее время хлорохин рекомендованВОЗ для лечения малярии, вызываемой P.vivax. Исследуемые в настоящий моментдозировки и схемы лечения хлорохиноми гидроксихлорохином в случае COVID-19отличаются от применяемых для леченияпациентов с малярией. Прием высоких дозэтих препаратов может вызыватьнеблагоприятные или крайне тяжелыепоследствия для здоровья. ВОЗустановила систематический и транспарентныйпорядок проведения научных исследованийи разработок, в том числе клиническихиспытаний лекарственных средств, вслучае чрезвычайных ситуаций в областиобщественного здравоохранения. Программаисследований и разработокВОЗ,приведенная в действие 7 января2020 г. для борьбы с COVID-19, призванаобеспечить ускоренное внедрениеэффективных тест-систем, вакцин илекарственных средств, которые могутприменяться для спасения жизней ипредупреждения крупномасштабныхкризисных ситуаций. ВОЗ также разработалакомплекс процедур для оценки эффективности,качества и безопасности медицинскихтехнологий в условиях чрезвычайныхситуаций."
"Подвержены ли люди, которые курят или употребляют табачные изделия, более высокому риску инфицирования COVID-19?","Курящие, по-видимому, болееуязвимы для COVID-19, так какв процессе курения они прикасаютсяпальцами (и, возможно, контаминированнымисигаретами) к губам, в результате чегоповышается риск попадания вируса вротовую полость человека. Кроме того,курильщики могут иметь в анамнезезаболевания легких или сниженнуюжизненную емкость легких, в результатечего значительно повышается рискразвития серьезного заболевания. Курениес помощью таких приспособлений, каккальяны, часто предполагает общееиспользование несколькими курильщикамимундштуков и трубок, что способствуетпередаче COVID-19 в однойсоциальной группе или общине.Состояния,при которых возрастает потребность вкислороде или снижается способностьорганизма правильно поглощать кислород,подвергают пациента более высокомуриску серьезного нарушения работылегких, например развития пневмонии."
Подвержены ли беременные женщины с COVID-19 более высокому риску?,"Внастоящее время ведутся исследованияс целью изучить воздействие инфекцииCOVID19 на беременных. Данные ограничены, нодоказательства того, что риск тяжелоготечения заболевания выше, чем в остальнойпопуляции, отсутствуют. Однакоизвестно, что поскольку во времябеременности происходят определенныеизменения в организме, в том числе виммунной системе, некоторые респираторныеинфекции могут представлять серьезнуюугрозу для беременных. Поэтому важно,чтобы они принимали профилактическиемеры защиты от COVID-19и сообщали лечащему врачу о возможныхсимптомах (в частности таких, какповышенная температура тела, кашель,затрудненное дыхание).ВОЗ будет пересматривать и актуализировать данную информацию и свои рекомендации по мере поступления новых данных."
Как беременной женщине защитить себя от COVID-19?,"Cпециальныхмер предосторожности, чтобы избежатьзаражения COVID-19, длябеременных не требуется. Вы можетепомочь защитить себя следующим образом:часто мойте	руки спиртосодержащим	средством для обработки рук или водой	с мылом;соблюдайте	правила социального дистанцирования;  не прикасайтесь	к глазам, носу или рту; соблюдайте	респираторную гигиену. Это	означает, что при кашле или чихании	необходимо прикрывать рот и нос сгибом	локтя или салфеткой. Использованную	салфетку следует немедленно утилизировать.При повышеннойтемпературе тела, кашле или затрудненномдыхании необходимо немедленно обратитесьза медицинской помощью. Начнитес обращения в медицинское учреждениепо телефону, следуйте указаниям местногооргана здравоохранения. Женщинам сCOVID-19 во время беременности, а также впослеродовом периоде следует продолжатьрегулярно являться на прием к врачу."
Необходимо ли беременным женщинам проходить тестирование на COVID-19?,Протоколы тестирования и правила тестирования населения могут различаться в зависимости от места проживания.Однако ВОЗ рекомендует проводить тестирование беременных с симптомами COVID-19 в первоочередном порядке. Женщины с COVID-19 во время беременности могут нуждаться в специализированном уходе.
Передается ли инфекция COVID-19 внутриутробно или от матери к ребенку?,Данные опередаче инфекции COVID-19 внутриутробноили от матери к ребенку отсутствуют.Выявить вирус в амниотической жидкостиили грудном молоке до настоящего временине удавалось.
Какой уход должен быть обеспечен во время беременности и родов?,"Все беременные,в том числе с подтвержденным заражениемили подозрением на заражение COVID-19, имеютправо на высококачественный уход впериод до, во время и после родов. Этовключает в себя предоставлениеантенатальной, неонатальной и постнатальнойпомощи, а также психиатрической помощи.Позитивныйопыт безопасного деторождения включает: уважительное	отношение; 	право	выбора сопровождающего лица,	присутствующего при родах;четкая	коммуникация с персоналом родильного	отделения; 	применение	надлежащей тактики обезболивания;мобильность	во время родов, если возможно, и свобода	выбора положения тела в родах.В случаеподтвержденного заражения или подозренияна заражение COVID-19 медико-санитарныеработники должны принять надлежащиемеры предосторожности для уменьшенияриска собственного заражения и зараженияокружающих, в том числе путем применениязащитной одежды."
Показано ли беременным женщинам с подозрением на заражение или подтвержденным заражением COVID-19 родоразрешение методом кесарева сечения?,"Нет. ВОЗрекомендует родоразрешение методомкесарева сечения только по медицинскимпоказаниям.Способродоразрешения являетсявопросом индивидуального выбора,основанного на предпочтенияхженщины и акушерско-гинекологическихпоказаниях."
Могут ли женщины с COVID-19 кормить грудью?,"Да. Грудное вскармливание допускается по желанию женщины с COVID-19. При этом необходимо: во время кормления соблюдать респираторную гигиену и надевать маску при наличии таковой;мыть руки до и после контакта с ребенком;регулярно очищать и дезинфицировать поверхности, к которым прикасается женщина."
Разрешается ли женщине с COVID-19 трогать и держать своего новорожденного ребенка?,"Да. Тесныйконтакт и раннее исключительно грудноевскармливание помогают ребенкуразвиваться. Женщина должна иметьвозможность: безопасно кормить ребенка грудью, соблюдая надлежащую респираторную гигиену; телесно контактировать с ребенком; инаходиться в одном помещении с ребенком. До и после контакта с ребенком необходимо мыть руки, а также содержать все поверхности в чистоте."
"Что можно предпринять, если женщина с COVID-19 слишком плохо себя чувствует для грудного кормления?","Если женщинас COVID-19 или любым осложнениемслишком плохо себя чувствует для грудногокормления, ей должна быть оказана помощьв обеспечении ребенка грудным молокомлюбым доступным и, по возможности,приемлемым для нее способом. К такимспособам могут относиться:сцеживание	молока;релактация;донорское	человеческое молоко."
В чем сходство возбудителей COVID‑19 и гриппа?,"Во‑первых, какCOVID‑19, так и грипп имеют сходнуюклиническую картину. То есть оба вирусавызывают респираторные заболевания свариантами течения от бессимптомногоили легкого до тяжелого, либо сосмертельным исходом.Во‑вторых,оба вируса передаются при физическомконтакте, через аэрозоль, а такжезагрязненные предметы. Таким образом,в обоих случаях будут результативнымиодни и те же меры общественногоздравоохранения, такие как соблюдениегигиены рук и респираторного этикета(прикрывание рта и носа при кашле иличихании сгибом локтя, либо салфеткой,которую после этого выбрасывают)."
В чем различие возбудителей COVID‑19 и гриппа?,"К важным различиямможно отнести темпы передачи инфекции.Средняя продолжительность инкубационногопериода (время от момента заражения довозникновения симптомов) и времягенерации (время между заражением одногочеловека и заражением другого) пригриппе меньше. По оценкам, время генерациипри COVID‑19 составляет 5–6 дней, тогдакак при гриппе оно составляет 3 дня.Это означает, что грипп можетраспространяться быстрее, чем COVID‑19.Крометого, ключевым элементом в распространениигриппа является передача инфекции втечение первых 3–5 дней болезни и,возможно, до дебюта симптомов, то естьдо появления симптомов заболевания. Сдругой стороны, хотя поступают сведения,что у некоторых больных COVID‑19вирусовыделение может возникать за24–48 часов до возникновения симптомов,в настоящее время, как представляется,оно не играет столь важной роли враспространении инфекции.Согласнопоследним данным, репродуктивное число,то есть количество лиц, которых можетзаразить один больной, при COVID‑19находится в диапазоне от 2 до 2,5, чтовыше, чем при гриппе. Однако проведениеоценок в отношении возбудителей COVID‑19и гриппа в значительной мере зависитот конкретного контекста и времени,поэтому прямые сравнения не всегдакорректны.Припередаче гриппа среди населения важнаяроль принадлежит детям. При COVID‑19дети, по предварительной информации, вменьшей степени подвержены заражению,чем взрослые: показатель пораженностив возрастной группе 0–19 лет низок.Кроме того, по предварительным даннымобследований домохозяйств в Китае,заражение детей происходит от взрослых,а не наоборот.Несмотряна то что набор симптомов при обоихзаболеваниях схож, доля случаев тяжелоготечения различается. По имеющимсясведениям, 80% случаев COVID‑19характеризуются легким или бессимптомнымтечением, 15% – тяжелым течением, прикотором требуется оксигенотерапия, ав 5% случаев заболевание принимаеткрайне тяжелый характер и требуетискусственной вентиляции легких. Доляслучаев тяжелого и крайне тяжелоготечения заболевания выше, чем при гриппе.Пациентамигруппы риска при гриппе являются дети,беременные женщины, пожилые люди, лицас фоновыми заболеваниями ииммунокомпрометированные лица. В случаеCOVID‑19, согласно текущему пониманиюзаболевания, факторами риска тяжелоготечения являются пожилой возраст иналичие фоновых заболеваний.Смертностьпри COVID‑19, вероятно, выше, чем пригриппе, особенности сезонном гриппе.Истинный коэффициент смертности внастоящее время определен неточно,однако, по имеющимся сведениям, летальность(то есть количество умерших, отнесенноек числу зарегистрированных случаевзаболевания) колеблется в пределах3–4%, а доля умерших от инфекции (количествоумерших, отнесенное к числу лиц синфекционными заболеваниями) ниже.Смертность при сезонном гриппе обычнонаходится на уровне до 0,1%. Тем не менее,смертность в значительной степенизависит от доступа к медицинской помощии ее качества."
Какие медицинские вмешательства существуют для лечения COVID‑19 и гриппа?,"В настоящее времяряд препаратов проходит клиническиеиспытания в Китае, а также разрабатываетсясвыше 20 вакцин от COVID‑19, однакоразрешенных к применению препаратов ивакцин в настоящее время не существует.С другой стороны, для борьбы с гриппомсуществуют противовирусные препаратыи вакцины. Противогриппозная вакцинанеэффективна в отношении возбудителяCOVID‑19, тем не менее в целях профилактикигриппа настоятельно рекомендуетсяпроходить ежегодную вакцинацию."
¿Qué es un coronavirus?,"Los coronavirus son una extensa familia de virus que pueden causar enfermedades tanto en animales como en humanos. En los humanos, se sabe que varios coronavirus causan infecciones respiratorias que pueden ir desde el resfriado común hasta enfermedadesmás graves como el síndrome respiratorio de Oriente Medio (MERS) y el síndrome respiratorio agudo severo (SRAS). El coronavirus que se ha descubierto más recientemente causa la enfermedad por coronavirus COVID-19."
¿Qué es la COVID-19?,La COVID-19 es la enfermedad infecciosa causada por el coronavirus que se ha descubierto más recientemente. Tanto el nuevo virus como la enfermedad eran desconocidos antes de que estallara el brote en Wuhan (China) en diciembre de 2019.
¿Cuáles son los síntomas de la COVID-19?,"Los síntomas más comunes de la COVID-19 son fiebre, cansancio y tos seca. Algunos pacientes pueden presentar dolores, congestión nasal, rinorrea, dolor de garganta o diarrea. Estos síntomas suelen ser leves y aparecen de formagradual. Algunas personas se infectan pero no desarrollan ningún síntoma y no se encuentran mal. La mayoría de las personas (alrededor del 80%) se recupera de la enfermedad sin necesidad de realizar ningún tratamiento especial.Alrededor de 1 de cada 6 personas que contraen la COVID-19 desarrolla una enfermedad grave y tiene dificultad para respirar. Las personas mayores y las que padecen afecciones médicas subyacentes, como hipertensión arterial, problemascardiacos o diabetes, tienen más probabilidades de desarrollar una enfermedad grave. En torno al 2% de las personas que han contraído la enfermedad han muerto. Las personas que tengan fiebre, tos y dificultad para respirar deben buscaratención médica."
¿Cómo se propaga la COVID-19?,"Una persona puede contraer la COVID-19 por contacto con otra que esté infectada por el virus. La enfermedad puede propagarse de persona a persona a través de las gotículas procedentes de la nariz o la boca que salen despedidas cuandouna persona infectada tose o exhala. Estas gotículas caen sobre los objetos y superficies que rodean a la persona, de modo que otras personas pueden contraer la COVID-19 si tocan estos objetos o superficies y luego se tocan los ojos, la narizo la boca. También pueden contagiarse si inhalan las gotículas que haya esparcido una persona con COVID-19 al toser o exhalar. Por eso es importante mantenerse a más de 1 metro (3 pies) de distancia de una persona que se encuentreenferma. La OMS está estudiando las investigaciones en curso sobre las formas de propagación de la COVID-19 y seguirá informando sobre los resultados actualizados."
¿Puede transmitirse a través del aire el virus causante de la COVID-19?,"Los estudios realizados hasta la fecha apuntan a que el virus causante de la COVID-19 se transmite principalmente por contacto con gotículas respiratorias, más que por el aire. Véase la respuesta anterior a la pregunta «¿Cómose propaga la COVID-19?»"
¿Es posible contagiarse de COVID-19 por contacto con una persona que no presente ningún síntoma?,"La principal forma de propagación de la enfermedad es a través de las gotículas respiratorias expelidas por alguien al toser. El riesgo de contraer la COVID-19 de alguien que no presente ningún síntoma es muy bajo. Sinembargo, muchas personas que contraen la COVID-19 solo presentan síntomas leves. Esto es particularmente cierto en las primeras etapas de la enfermedad. Por lo tanto, es posible contagiarse de alguien que, por ejemplo, solamente tenga una tosleve y no se sienta enfermo. La OMS está estudiando las investigaciones en curso sobre el periodo de transmisión de la COVID-19 y seguirá informando sobre los resultados actualizados."
¿Es posible contagiarse de COVID-19 por contacto con las heces de una persona que padezca la enfermedad?,"El riesgo de contraer la COVID-19 por contacto con las heces de una persona infectada parece ser bajo. Aunque las investigaciones iniciales apuntan a que el virus puede estar presente en algunos casos en las heces, la propagación por esta víano es uno de los rasgos característicos del brote. La OMS está estudiando las investigaciones en curso sobre las formas de propagación de la COVID-19 y seguirá informando sobre los nuevos resultados. No obstante, se tratade un riesgo y por lo tanto es una razón más para lavarse las manos con frecuencia, después de ir al baño y antes de comer."
¿Qué puedo hacer para protegerme y prevenir la propagación de la enfermedad?,"Medidas de protección para todas las personas. Manténgase al día de la información más reciente sobre el brote de COVID-19, a la que puede acceder en el sitio web de la OMS y a través de las autoridades de salud pública pertinentes a nivel nacional y local.Se han registrado casos en muchos países de todo el mundo, y en varios de ellos se han producido brotes. Las autoridades chinas y las de otros países han conseguido enlentecer o detener el avance de los brotes, pero la situaciónes impredecible y es necesario comprobar con regularidad las noticias más recientes. Hay varias precauciones que se pueden adoptar para reducir la probabilidad de contraer o de contagiar la COVID-19: Lávese las manos a fondo y con frecuencia usando un desinfectante a base de alcohol o con agua y jabón. ¿Por qué? Lavarse las manos con agua y jabón o usando un desinfectante a base de alcohol mata los virus que pueda haber en sus manos. Mantenga una distancia mínima de 1 metro (3 pies) entre usted y cualquier persona que tosa o estornude. ¿Por qué? Cuando alguien tose o estornuda, despide por la nariz o por la boca unas gotículas de líquido que pueden contener el virus. Si está demasiado cerca, puede respirar las gotículas y conellas el virus de la COVID-19, si la persona que tose tiene la enfermedad. Evite tocarse los ojos, la nariz y la boca. ¿Por qué? Las manos tocan muchas superficies y pueden recoger virus. Una vez contaminadas, las manos pueden transferir el virus a los ojos, la nariz o la boca. Desde allí, el virus puede entrar en su cuerpo y causarlela enfermedad. Tanto usted como las personas que les rodean deben asegurarse de mantener una buena higiene de las vías respiratorias. Eso significa cubrirse la boca y la nariz con el codo doblado o con un pañuelo de papel al toser o estornudar. Elpañuelo usado debe desecharse de inmediato. ¿Por qué? Los virus se propagan a través de las gotículas. Al mantener una buena higiene respiratoria está protegiendo a las personas que le rodean de virus como los del resfriado, la gripe y la COVID-19. Permanezca en casa si no se encuentra bien. Si tiene fiebre, tos y dificultad para respirar, busque atención médica y llame con antelación. Siga las instrucciones de las autoridades sanitarias locales. ¿Por qué? Las autoridades nacionales y locales dispondrán de la información más actualizada sobre la situación en su zona. Llamar con antelación permitirá que su dispensador de atenciónde salud le dirija rápidamente hacia el centro de salud adecuado. Esto también le protegerá a usted y ayudará a prevenir la propagación de virus y otras infecciones. Manténgase informado sobre las últimas novedades en relación con la COVID-19. Siga los consejos de su dispensador de atención de salud, de las autoridades sanitarias pertinentes a nivel nacional y local o de su empleadorsobre la forma de protegerse a sí mismo y a los demás ante la COVID-19. ¿Por qué? Las autoridades nacionales y locales dispondrán de la información más actualizada acerca de si la COVID-19 se está propagando en su zona. Son los interlocutores más indicadospara dar consejos sobre lo que debe hacer la gente de su zona para protegerse. Consulte las noticias más recientes sobre las zonas de mayor peligro (es decir, las ciudades y lugares donde la enfermedad se está propagando más extensamente). Si le es posible, evite desplazarse a estas zonas, sobre todo si su edad es avanzada o tiene usted diabetes, cardiopatías o neumopatías. ¿Por qué? Estas precauciones se deben adoptar en estas zonas porque la probabilidad de contraer la COVID-19 es más elevada. Medidas de protección para las personas que se encuentran en zonas donde se está propagando la COVID-19 o que las han visitado recientemente (en los últimos 14 días) Siga las orientaciones antes expuestas (Medidas de protección para todas las personas) Permanezca en casa si empieza a encontrarse mal, aunque se trate de síntomas leves como dolor de cabeza, fiebre ligera (37,3 oC o más) y rinorrea leve, hasta que se recupere. Si le resulta indispensable salir de casa o recibir una visita (por ejemplo, para conseguir alimentos), póngase una mascarilla para no infectar a otras personas. ¿Por qué? Evitar los contactos con otras personas y las visitas a centros médicos permitirá que estos últimos funcionen con mayor eficacia y ayudará a protegerle a usted y a otras personas deposibles infecciones por el virus de la COVID-19 u otros. Si tiene fiebre, tos y dificultad para respirar, busque rápidamente asesoramiento médico, ya que podría deberse a una infección respiratoria u otra afección grave. Llame con antelación e informe a su dispensadorde atención de salud sobre cualquier viaje que haya realizado recientemente o cualquier contacto que haya mantenido con viajeros. ¿Por qué? Llamar con antelación permitirá que su dispensador de atención de salud le dirija rápidamente hacia el centro de salud adecuado. Esto ayudará también a prevenir la propagaciónde virus y otras infecciones."
¿Qué probabilidades hay de que contraiga la COVID-19?,"El riesgo depende del lugar donde se encuentre usted y, más concretamente, de si se está produciendo un brote de COVID-19 en dicho lugar. Para la mayoría de las personas que se encuentran en la mayor parte de los lugares, el riesgo de contraer esta enfermedad continúa siendo bajo. Sin embargo, sabemos que hay algunos lugares (ciudades o zonas) donde se está propagandoy donde el riesgo de contraerla es más elevado, tanto para las personas que viven en ellas como para las que las visitan. Los gobiernos y las autoridades sanitarias están actuando con determinación cada vez que se detecta un nuevocaso de COVID-19. Es importante que todos respetemos las restricciones relativas a los viajes, los desplazamientos y las concentraciones multitudinarias de personas aplicables a cada lugar en concreto. Si cooperamos con las medidas de lucha contrala enfermedad, reduciremos el riesgo que corremos cada uno de nosotros de contraerla o de propagarla. Como se ha comprobado en China y en otros países, es posible detener los brotes de COVID-19 y poner fin a su transmisión. No obstante, la gran rapidez con que pueden aparecer nuevos brotes nos obliga a ser conscientes de la situaciónen los lugares donde nos encontramos o donde tengamos intención de ir. La OMS publica cada día actualizaciones sobre la situación de la COVID-19 en el mundo, que se pueden consultar, en inglés, en la página https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/."
¿Debo preocuparme por la COVID-19?,"Por lo general, los síntomas de la COVID-19 son leves, sobre todo en los niños y los adultos jóvenes. No obstante, también pueden ser graves y obligan a hospitalizar a alrededor de uno de cada cinco infectados. Por consiguiente,es bastante normal preocuparse por los efectos que el brote de COVID-19 puede tener en nosotros y en nuestros seres queridos. Esta preocupación debe servirnos para adoptar medidas de protección para nosotros, nuestros seres queridos y las comunidades donde vivimos. La medida principal y más importante es la higiene regular y completa de las manos y de lasvías respiratorias. En segundo lugar, es importante mantenerse informado y seguir los consejos de las autoridades sanitarias locales, como los relativos a los viajes, los desplazamientos y los eventos donde se pueda concentrar un gran númerode personas. Puede consultar los consejos sobre protección en la página https://www.who.int/es/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public."
¿Quién corre riesgo de desarrollar una enfermedad grave?,"Todavía tenemos mucho por aprender sobre la forma en que la COVID-2019 afecta a los humanos, pero parece que las personas mayores y las que padecen afecciones médicas preexistentes (como hipertensión arterial, enfermedades cardiacaso diabetes) desarrollan casos graves de la enfermedad con más frecuencia que otras."
¿Son eficaces los antibióticos para prevenir o tratar la COVID-19?,"No. Los antibióticos no son eficaces contra los virus, solo contra las infecciones bacterianas. La COVID-19 está causada por un virus, de modo que los antibióticos no sirven frente a ella. No se deben usar antibióticos comomedio de prevención o tratamiento de la COVID-19. Solo deben usarse para tratar una infección bacteriana siguiendo las indicaciones de un médico."
¿Existen medicamentos o terapias que permitan prevenir o curar la COVID-19?,"Aunque algunos remedios occidentales, tradicionales o caseros pueden proporcionar confort y aliviar los síntomas de la COVID-19, no hay pruebas de que los medicamentos actuales puedan prevenir o curar la enfermedad. La OMS no recomienda la automedicación,en particular con antibióticos, para prevenir o curar la COVID-19. Hay varios ensayos clínicos en curso con medicamentos occidentales y tradicionales. La OMS facilitará información actualizada tan pronto como los resultadosde los ensayos clínicos estén disponibles."
"¿Existe alguna vacuna, medicamento o tratamiento para la COVID-19?","Todavía no. Hasta la fecha, no hay ninguna vacuna ni medicamento antiviral específico para prevenir o tratar la COVID-2019. Sin embargo, los afectados deben recibir atención de salud para aliviar los síntomas. Las personasque presentan casos graves de la enfermedad deben ser hospitalizadas. La mayoría de los pacientes se recuperan con la ayuda de medidas de apoyo. Se están investigando posibles vacunas y distintos tratamientos farmacológicos específicos. Hay ensayos clínicos en curso para ponerlos a prueba. La OMS está coordinando los esfuerzos dirigidos a desarrollar vacunasy medicamentos para prevenir y tratar la COVID-19. Las formas más eficaces de protegerse a uno mismo y a los demás frente a la COVID-19 son: lavarse las manos con frecuencia, cubrirse la boca con el codo o con un pañuelo de papel al toser y mantener una distancia de al menos 1 metro(3 pies) con las personas que tosen o estornudan. (Véase ¿Qué puedo hacer para protegerme y prevenir la propagación de la enfermedad?)."
¿Son lo mismo la COVID-19 y el SRAS?,"No. El genoma del virus que causa la COVID-19 y el del responsable del síndrome respiratorio agudo severo (SRAS) son similares, pero no iguales. El SRAS es más letal pero mucho menos infeccioso que la COVID-19. Desde 2003, no se han registradobrotes de SRAS en ningún lugar del mundo."
¿Debo llevar mascarilla para protegerme?,"Si no se presentan los síntomas respiratorios característicos de la COVID-19 (sobre todo, tos) o no se cuida de una persona que pueda haber contraído esta enfermedad, no es necesario llevar puesta una mascarilla clínica. Recuerdeque las mascarillas desechables solo se pueden utilizar una vez y tenga en cuenta también que, si no está usted enfermo o no cuida de una persona que lo esté, está malgastando una mascarilla. Las existencias de mascarillasen el mundo se están agotando, y la OMS insta a utilizarlas de forma sensata. La OMS aconseja hacer un uso racional de las mascarillas clínicas para no derrochar innecesariamente ni usar indebidamente unos utensilios que son valiosos (véase el apartado Cuándo y cómo usar mascarilla). Las medidas frente a la COVID-19 más eficaces para protegerse a uno mismo y a los demás son: lavarse las manos con frecuencia, cubrirse la boca con el codo o con un pañuelo de papel al toser y mantener una distancia de, al menos,1 metro (3 pies) con las personas que tosen o estornudan. Para más información a este respecto, pueden consultarse las medidas básicas de protección frente al nuevo coronavirus."
"Cómo ponerse, usar, quitarse y desechar una mascarilla","1. Recuerde que solo deben usar mascarilla los trabajadores sanitarios, los cuidadores y las personas con síntomas respiratorios como fiebre y tos. 2. Antes de tocar la mascarilla, lávese las manos con un desinfectante a base de alcohol o con agua y jabón. 3. Inspeccione la mascarilla para ver si tiene rasgaduras o agujeros. 4. Oriente hacia arriba la parte superior (donde se encuentra la tira de metal). 5. Asegúrese de orientar hacia afuera el lado correcto de la mascarilla (el lado coloreado). 6. Colóquese la mascarilla sobre la cara. Pellizque la tira de metal o el borde rígido de la mascarilla para que se amolde a la forma de su nariz. 7. Tire hacia abajo de la parte inferior de la mascarilla para que le cubra la boca y la barbilla. 8. Después de usarla, quítese la mascarilla; retire las cintas elásticas de detrás de las orejas manteniendo la mascarilla alejada de la cara y la ropa, para no tocar las superficies potencialmente contaminadas de la mascarilla. 9. Deseche la mascarilla en un contenedor cerrado inmediatamente después de su uso. 10. Lávese las manos después de tocar o desechar la mascarilla. Use un desinfectante a base de alcohol o, si están visiblemente sucias, láveselas con agua y jabón."
¿Cuánto dura el periodo de incubación de la COVID-19?,"El «período de incubación» es el tiempo que transcurre entre la infección por el virus y la aparición de los síntomas de la enfermedad. La mayoría de las estimaciones respecto al periodo de incubaciónde la COVID-19 oscilan entre 1 y 14 días, y en general se sitúan en torno a cinco días. Estas estimaciones se irán actualizando a medida que se tengan más datos."
¿Pueden los humanos contraer el virus de la COVID-19 por contacto con un animal?,"Los coronavirus son una extensa familia de virus que son comunes entre los murciélagos y otros animales. En raras ocasiones las personas se infectan por estos virus, que luego pueden propagarse a otras personas. Por ejemplo, el SRAS-CoV iba asociadoa las civetas y el MERS-CoV se transmite a través de los dromedarios. Todavía no se ha confirmado el posible origen animal de la COVID-19. Como medida de protección al visitar mercados de animales vivos o en otras situaciones parecidas, evite el contacto directo con los animales y las superficies que estén en contacto con ellos. Asegúrese de que en todo momento se observenprácticas adecuadas de higiene de los alimentos. Manipule con cuidado la carne, la leche o los órganos de animales crudos para evitar la contaminación de alimentos no cocinados y evite el consumo de productos animales crudos opoco cocinados."
¿Mi mascota me puede contagiar la COVID-19?,"Aunque ha habido un caso de un perro infectado en Hong Kong, hasta la fecha no hay pruebas de que un perro, un gato o cualquier mascota pueda transmitir la COVID-19. La COVID-19 se propaga principalmente a través de las gotículas producidaspor una persona infectada al toser, estornudar o hablar. Para protegerse a sí mismo, lávese las manos a fondo frecuentemente. La OMS se mantiene al tanto de las últimas investigaciones a este respecto y otras cuestiones relacionadas con la COVID-19 y proporcionará información actualizada de las conclusiones que se vayan obteniendo."
¿Cuánto tiempo sobrevive el virus en una superficie?,"No se sabe con certeza cuánto tiempo sobrevive el virus causante de la COVID-19 en una superficie, pero parece comportarse como otros coronavirus. Los estudios realizados (incluida la información preliminar disponible sobre el virus de laCOVID-19) indican que los coronavirus pueden subsistir en una superficie desde unas pocas horas hasta varios días. El tiempo puede variar en función de las condiciones (por ejemplo, el tipo de superficie, la temperatura o la humedaddel ambiente). Si cree que una superficie puede estar infectada, límpiela con un desinfectante común para matar el virus y protegerse de este modo a usted mismo y a los demás. Lávese las manos con un desinfectante a base de alcohol o conagua y jabón. Evite tocarse los ojos, la boca o la nariz."
¿Es seguro recibir un paquete de una zona en la que se hayan notificado casos de COVID-19?,"Sí. La probabilidad de que una persona infectada contamine artículos comerciales es baja, y el riesgo de contraer el virus causante de la COVID-19 por contacto con un paquete que haya sido manipulado, transportado y expuesto a diferentescondiciones y temperaturas también es bajo."
¿Hay algo que no deba hacer?,"Las siguientes medidas NO SON eficaces contra la COVID-2019 y pueden resultar perjudiciales: FumarLlevar varias mascarillasTomar antibióticos (Véase  ¿Existen medicamentos o terapias que permitan prevenir o curar la COVID-19?) En cualquier caso, si tiene fiebre, tos y dificultad para respirar, trate de obtener atención médica lo antes posible para reducir el riesgo de desarrollar una infección más grave, y asegúrese de informar a su dispensadorde atención de salud acerca de sus viajes recientes."
¿Se conoce la fuente del coronavirus responsable de la COVID-19?,"Hasta la fecha se desconoce la fuente del SARS-CoV-2, el coronavirus (CoV) que causa la COVID-19. Todos los datos disponibles sugieren que el SARS-CoV-2 tiene un origen animal y no es un virus creado en laboratorio. Lo más probable es que el virustenga su reservorio natural en los murciélagos. El SARS-CoV-2 pertenece a un grupo de virus genéticamente afines en el que se encuentran también el SARS-CoV y otros CoV que han podido aislarse en poblaciones de murciélagos.El MERS-CoV también pertenece a este grupo, pero está menos relacionado con estos últimos."
¿Cómo se produjeron las primeras infecciones humanas por el SARS-CoV-2?,"Los primeros casos humanos de COVID-19 se detectaron en la ciudad de Wuhan, China, en diciembre de 2019. Por el momento, no es posible determinar con precisión cómo se infectaron las primeras personas en China por el SARS-CoV-2. A pesar de ello, el virus del SARS-CoV, que causó el brote de SARS en 2003, pasó de un reservorio animal (la civeta, un animal silvestre de granja) a los seres humanos para luego propagarse entre ellos. De manera similar, se piensa que elSARS-CoV-2 cruzó la barrera entre especies e infectó en un primer momento a seres humanos, si bien muy probablemente a través de un huésped intermedio, es decir, otra especie animal más manipulada por el ser humano(por ejemplo un animal doméstico, un animal silvestre o un animal silvestre domesticado, el cual no ha sido identificado hasta la fecha). Hasta que se localice y controle la fuente de este virus, existe el riesgo de que vuelva a pasar a la población humana y de que se produzcan nuevos brotes como los que estamos sufriendo actualmente."
¿Se transmite la COVID-19 por el aire?,"El virus responsable de la COVID-19 se transmite principalmente a través de gotículas respiratorias expulsadas por una persona infectada cuando tose, estornuda o habla. Esas gotitas son demasiado pesadas para flotar en el aire y caen rápidamentesobre el suelo u otra superficie. La infección puede producirse al respirar el virus expulsado por una persona con COVID-19 situada a menos de un metro de distancia, o al tocar una superficie contaminada y luego tocarse los ojos, la nariz o la boca antes de lavarse las manos.

¿Qué dimensiones debe alcanzar una reunión o un evento para ser considerado una «concentración multitudinaria»?,"Entran en la categoría de concentraciones multitudinarias los grandes eventos deportivos internacionales como los juegos olímpicos o los mundiales, al igual que las celebraciones religiosas internacionales como la peregrinación a la Meca. Sin embargo, la definición de concentración multitudinaria de la OMS puede abarcar asimismo conferencias y eventos de menor relieve. Se considera que un evento es una «concentración multitudinaria» si congrega a un número de personas tan elevado que pueda suponer una presión para los recursos de planificación y respuesta del sistema de salud de la comunidad en la que se celebra. Hay que tomar en cuenta la ubicación y duración de cada evento, así como su número de participantes. Así, por ejemplo, si un evento tiene lugar, a lo largo de varios días, en un pequeño Estado insular, con un sistema de salud de capacidad más bien reducida, incluso un evento que reúna a unos pocos miles de participantes podría someter al sistema de salud a una fuerte presión y ser por tanto considerado como una «concentración multitudinaria». En cambio, si un evento se celebra en una gran ciudad, situada en un país que disponga de un sistema de salud sólido y dotado de suficientes recursos, y no se extiende más allá de unas pocas horas, puede no constituir una «concentración multitudinaria»."
¿Recomienda la OMS cancelar todas las concentraciones multitudinarias debido a la COVID-19?,"No. Cada concentración multitudinaria internacional es diferente, de modo que también pueden variar los factores tenidos en cuenta a la hora de determinar si debe o no cancelarse. Toda decisión de modificar una concentración internacional programada debe basarse en una evaluación meticulosa de los riesgos y de cómo podrían gestionarse, así como del nivel de planificación del evento. En la evaluación deben participar todas las partes interesadas en el evento y, en particular, las autoridades sanitarias del país o la comunidad que vaya a acogerlo. Estas autoridades y las partes interesadas son quienes están en mejor posición para evaluar el nivel de tensión que podrían sufrir el sistema de salud y los servicios de emergencia locales y para determinar si ese nivel de presión resulta aceptable en esa situación concreta."
¿Qué factores deben tener en cuenta los organizadores y las autoridades sanitarias a la hora de evaluar si los riesgos son aceptables o no?,"En los países en los que no se haya constatado una transmisión comunitaria de la COVID-19, la consideración prioritaria será determinar si la concentración multitudinaria prevista incrementa sustancialmente el riesgo de que el virus entre en el país y se establezca, así como el riesgo de que los participantes importen la infección a sus países de origen y contribuyan a su propagación mundial. Al llevar a cabo esta evaluación, los organizadores y las autoridades sanitarias nacionales o locales deben reconocer que el riesgo de importación de casos de COVID-19 está naturalmente relacionado con los viajes internacionales. También deben reconocer que no es realista ni deseable fijarse un objetivo de riesgo cero. Al plantearse la celebración de una concentración multitudinaria, los organizadores y las autoridades sanitarias deben determinar cuál es el nivel de riesgo aceptable y cuáles son las medidas adicionales necesarias para mitigar los riesgos.En el caso de los países en los que la COVID-19 ya ha empezado a difundirse en la comunidad, la consideración clave será:Intentar contener o al menos ralentizar la propagación del virus en la comunidad local/país.Evitar que los participantes de otros países se infecten con la COVID-19. En cada caso, debe evaluarse el riesgo a la luz de las características conocidas de la COVID-19, su gravedad, su transmisibilidad y la eficacia de las medidas destinadas a prevenir o reducir la transmisión. También hay que tener en cuenta la presión que ya esté soportando el sistema sanitario local, en el marco de su respuesta al brote o brotes de COVID-19, y la presión añadida que podría suponerle la celebración de la concentración multitudinaria.Pueden encontrar más orientaciones sobre las cuestiones que conviene tomar en cuenta en el documento de la OMS sobre las recomendaciones clave en materia de planificación de concentraciones multitudinarias en el contexto del actual brote de COVID-19, del 14 de febrero de 2020: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/key-planning-recommendations-for-mass-gatherings-in-the-context-of-the-current-covid-19-outbreak."
¿Qué pasa si mi organización no dispone de las competencias necesarias para evaluar los riesgos que entraña la COVID-19 para la concentración multitudinaria que hemos previsto?,"Es muy probable que las autoridades de salud pública nacionales y locales del país en el que planean celebrar esa concentración sepan cómo llevar a cabo una evaluación de los riesgos para la salud. Si hay una oficina de la OMS en el país, también podrá brindarles algún tipo de apoyo técnico, al igual que la oficina regional de la OMS en la zona del mundo en la que se encuentren. Pueden encontrar los nombres y los datos de contacto de las oficinas regionales de la OMS en https://www.who.int/es/about/who-we-are/regional-offices."
"Si seguimos adelante con una concentración multitudinaria internacional, ¿qué podemos hacer para reducir el riesgo de que los participantes contraigan la COVID-19?","Fomentar el lavado de manos, la higiene respiratoria y el distanciamiento social en el evento. Asegurarse de disponer de los datos de contacto de emergencia de todos los participantes, incluidos los lugares en los que se hospeden durante el evento. Se les debe aclarar que esta información puede ser comunicada a las autoridades locales de salud pública para permitir la rápida localización de sus contactos en el caso de que un participante enferme de COVID-19. Los organizadores del evento deben haber acordado un plan de preparación por si uno o más participantes enferman y manifiestan síntomas de la COVID-19. Este plan debe prever el rápido aislamiento de la persona enferma y su traslado en condiciones de seguridad a un centro de salud local. Hay que considerar la posibilidad de reducir el número de participantes en el evento, facilitando la participación por video o teleconferencia y eventualmente examinando a los participantes en los accesos al recinto en busca de síntomas de la COVID-19 (tos, fiebre, malestar).

¿Dónde puedo encontrar más orientaciones sobre la evaluación y la gestión de los riesgos para la salud en relación con las concentraciones multitudinarias?,La OMS ha elaborado unas directrices y también un curso de capacitación sobre cómo planificar una concentración multitudinaria. Tanto las directrices como el curso se centran en cómo llevar a cabo una evaluación de riesgos y planificar y gestionar los riesgos para la salud en colaboración con las autoridades locales: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/points-of-entry-and-mass-gatherings.   Pueden encontrar orientaciones y comunicarlas a los participantes acerca de cómo protegerse a sí mismos y a sus seres queridos de la COVID-19 en https://www.who.int/es/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public.
¿Cómo se recomienda limpiar la ropa de cama y las toallas sucias de pacientes con COVID-19?,"Se recomienda que al manipular ropa de cama y toallas sucias de pacientes con COVID-19: Se lleve un EPP apropiado antes de tocar sábanas sucias, el cual incluye guantes resistentes, mascarilla, protección ocular (gafas o careta protectora), bata de manga larga, delantal (si la bata no es impermeable) y botas o calzado cerrado. No se lleven nunca las sábanas sucias pegadas al cuerpo y se metan en un recipiente cerrado herméticamente y claramente rotulado (por ejemplo, una bolsa o un cubo). Si hay excrementos sólidos en las sábanas, como heces o vómitos, se quiten cuidadosamente con un objeto plano y duro y se depositen en la cuña o el inodoro/letrina correspondiente antes de meter las sábanas en el contenedor designado a tal fin. Si la letrina no se encuentra en la misma habitación que el paciente, el excremento sólido se introducirá en un cubo tapado para deshacerse del mismo en el inodoro o la letrina. Se laven y desinfecten las sábanas a máquina con agua caliente (60-90°C) y detergente para ropa. Si no es posible lavar las sábanas a máquina, se pueden dejar en remojo en agua caliente y jabón en un barril grande, utilizando un palo para removerlas y evitando salpicar. Si no se dispone de agua caliente, se recomienda poner a remojo las sábanas en una solución de cloro al 0,05% durante unos 30 minutos. Posteriormente, las sábanas deben aclararse con agua limpia y dejarlas al sol hasta que se sequen completamente. En los dos documentos siguientes se proporciona información adicional sobre prácticas óptimas para la limpieza del entorno: 1) Prevención y control de infecciones respiratorias agudas epidemiógenas y pandemiógenas en la atención de salud: https://www.who.int/csr/bioriskreduction/infection_control/publication/en/ 2) Prácticas óptimas para la limpieza del entorno en los centros sanitarios  de lugares con recursos limitados (documento elaborado por los CDC y la Red Africana para el Control de las Infecciones (ICAN) en colaboración con la OMS): https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/resource-limited/environmental-cleaning-508.pdf. ¿Cuáles son las recomendaciones para la desinfección de vehículos, mercancías y productos procedentes de China u otros países afectados por la COVID-19? Hasta la fecha no se dispone de información epidemiológica que indique la transmisión de la COVID-19 en humanos por contacto con mercancías, productos o vehículos enviados desde países afectados por la enfermedad. Por este motivo, no se han formulado recomendaciones para la desinfección de mercancías y productos procedentes de países afectados por la COVID-19, ya que no se dispone de datos empíricos que demuestren que estos productos presentan riesgos para la salud pública. La OMS seguirá de cerca la evolución de la enfermedad y actualizará las recomendaciones según proceda."
¿Qué EPP deben utilizar los profesionales sanitarios que realicen hisopados nasofaríngeos o bucofaríngeos en pacientes con COVID-19 presunta o confirmada?,"Los profesionales sanitarios que realizan hisopados nasofaríngeos o bucofaríngeos en pacientes con COVID-19 presunta o confirmada deben estar capacitados para llevar a cabo el procedimiento y llevar una bata de manga larga limpia no estéril, una mascarilla de uso médico, protección ocular (gafas o careta protectora) y guantes. El procedimiento debe realizarse en una sala separada o de aislamiento y durante la obtención de muestras nasofaríngeas los profesionales sanitarios deben pedir a los pacientes que se cubran la boca con una mascarilla de uso médico o un pañuelo. Aunque los hisopados nasofaríngeos y bucofaríngeos pueden provocar un acceso de tos al paciente que se somete al procedimiento, actualmente no se dispone de datos que indiquen que la tos producida por la toma de muestras nasofaríngeas y bucofaríngeas incremente el riesgo de transmisión de la COVID-19 a través de aerosoles. ¿Se someten los productos sanguíneos a exámenes para detectar el virus de la COVID-19 en los centros de sangre? No. Aunque se han detectado fragmentos del ARN del SARS-CoV-2 (el virus de la COVID-19) en la sangre de pacientes que presentan síntomas de la enfermedad, no significa que el virus sea viable/infeccioso. En general, los virus que provocan enfermedades respiratorias no se transmiten por transfusiones de sangre. Los centros de sangre deberían aplicar medidas para el cribado de los donantes de sangre a fin de evitar que personas con síntomas respiratorios o fiebre donen sangre. Como medida de precaución, los centros de sangre podrían promover la autoexclusión de las personas que hayan viajado a un país afectado por la COVID-19 en los 14 días previos a la donación, las personas a las que se haya diagnosticado la enfermedad o las personas que hayan estado en contacto cercano con un caso confirmado de COVID-19. ¿Deben ponerse sistemáticamente botas, delantales impermeables  o monos como equipo de protección personal (EPP)  los profesionales de la atención de salud  que atienden a pacientes con infecciónpresunta o confirmada por 2019-nCoV? No. En las orientaciones de la OMS vigentes para el personal sanitario que atiende a los pacientes con enfermedad respiratoria aguda presunta o confirmada por el 2019-nCoV se recomienda el uso de precauciones contra la transmisión por contactoy por gotículas, además de las precauciones habituales que debe tomar siempre todo el personal de atención de salud para todos los pacientes.  Por lo que respecta al EPP, entre las precauciones contra la transmisiónpor contacto y por gotículas se incluyen las siguientes: llevar guantes desechables para proteger las manos, batas limpias, no estériles para evitar que se contamine la ropa, mascarillas de uso médico para proteger la narizy la boca, y protección ocular (por ejemplo, gafas o pantalla facial), antes de entrar a la sala de admisión de los pacientes con infección respiratoria aguda presunta o confirmada por 2019-nCoV.  Solo se requieren mascarillasrespiratorias (por ejemplo, N95) para los procedimientos que generan aerosoles.

¿Las mascarillas faciales de uso médico pueden esterilizarse y reutilizarse?,"No. Las mascarillas faciales de uso médico desechables están concebidas para utilizarse una sola vez. Después de su uso, deben retirarse mediante técnicas apropiadas (por ejemplo, sin tocar la parte frontal, retirar estirando por detrás las tiras elásticas o lazos que las sujetan a las orejas) y desecharse de inmediato en un cubo con tapa para desechos infecciosos, y posteriormente se realizará la higiene de manos.  Para más información sobre el uso de mascarillas en el contexto del brote de nCoV, pulse aquí: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-health-care-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak."
¿Por qué recomienda la OMS precauciones contra la transmisión por contacto y por gotículas y no la utilización sistemáticas de precauciones contra la transmisión por vía aérea para el personal sanitario que presta cuidados a pacientes con infección presunta o confirmada por 2019-nCoV?,"La OMS elaboró sus orientaciones rápidas basándose en el consenso de expertos internacionales, quienes examinaron las pruebas actualmente disponibles sobre los modos de transmisión del 2019-nCoV. Esas pruebas demuestran la transmisión vírica por gotículas y contacto con superficies contaminadas del equipo; no apoya la transmisión sistemática por vía aérea. Puede haber transmisión por vía aérea, como se ha demostrado con otras enfermedades respiratorias vírica, durante procedimientos que general aerosol (por ejemplo, intubación traqueal, broncoscopia), por lo que la OMS recomienda precauciones contra la transmisión por vía aérea para esos procedimientos. Para más información sobre la protección del personal sanitario contra el 2019-nCoV, pulse aquí: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control-during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected-20200125."
¿Recomienda la OMS ponerse habitualmente mascarillas durante el brote de 2019-nCoV?,"No. La OMS no recomienda que las personas asintomáticas (es decir, sin síntomas respiratorios) lleven mascarillas de uso médico en la comunidad, puesto que en estos momentos no hay pruebas de que el uso sistemático de mascarillas de uso médico por parte de personas sanas prevenga la transmisión del 2019-nCoV.  Se recomienda el uso de mascarillas por personas sintomáticas en la comunidad.  El uso inadecuado o excesivo de mascarillas clínicas puede provocar graves problemas de carencia de suministros y que no haya mascarillas para las personas que necesitan llevarlas. En los centros de atención de salud en los que el personal sanitario se ocupa directamente de pacientes con infección respiratoria aguda presunta o confirmada por 2019-nCoV, las mascarillas son un elemento importante en la contención de la propagación del 2019-nCoV, junto con otro EPP y la higiene de manos. Para más información sobre el uso de las mascarillas médicas, pulse aquí: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-health-care-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak."
¿Pueden los pacientes con infección por nCoV presunta o confirmada ser agrupados en la misma sala?,"Lo ideal sería que los pacientes con enfermedad respiratoria aguda por 2019-nCoV presunta y confirmada sean aislados en habitaciones individuales. Ahora bien, cuando ello no sea factible (por ejemplo, por el limitado número de habitaciones individuales) la agrupación de los pacientes es una opción aceptable. Algunos pacientes con infección presunta por 2019-nCoV puede que tangan otras enfermedades respiratorias, por lo que deben ser agrupados independientemente de los pacientes con infección confirmada por 2019-nCoV. Debe mantenerse en todo momento una distancia mínima de 1 metro entre las camas."
¿Necesitan ser hospitalizados los pacientes con infección presunta o confirmada por 2019-nCoV si presentan una forma leve de la enfermedad?,"No. Puede que no se requiera hospitalización para los pacientes que presentan una forma leve de la enfermedad, por ejemplo: febrícula, tos, malestar general, rinorrea, faringoamigdalitis sin signos de alerta,  como dificultades de respiración,  aumento de los síntomas respiratorios (como esputo o hemoptisis), síntomas gastrointestinales, como náusea, vómitos y/o diarrea y sin cambios en el estado mental, a menos que haya indicios preocupantes de rápido deterioro clínico.   Debe instruirse a todos los pacientes que haya recibido el alta que vuelvan al hospital si se manifiesta algún síntoma de la enfermedad o los síntomas empeoran.  Para más información sobre los criterios de ingreso, pulse el siguiente enlace: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected.

¿Se necesitan hospitales especializados o de referencia para los pacientes con infección presunta o confirmada por 2019-nCoV cuando se requiere hospitalización?,"No. En las recomendaciones actuales de la OMS no se incluye la prescripción del uso exclusivo de hospitales especializados o de referencia para tratar a pacientes con enfermedad respiratoria aguda por 2019-nCoV presunta o confirmada .   Ahora bien, cada país o jurisdicción local puede decidir por atender a los pacientes en dichos hospitales si se estima que son los que más probablemente podrán atender con seguridad a los pacientes con infección presunta o confirmada por 2019-nCoV o por otras razones clínicas (por ejemplo, disponibilidad de reanimación cardiopulmonar avanzada o cuidados intensivos). Independientemente de ello, todo establecimiento de salud que atienda a pacientes con infección por 2019-nCoV presunta o confirmada deben adherirse a las recomendaciones de la OMS sobre prevención y control de las infecciones para que la atención de salud proteja a los pacientes, el personal y los visitantes. Puede consultar las orientaciones en el siguiente enlace: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control-during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected-20200125."
¿Qué desinfectantes se recomiendan para la limpieza ambiental de los establecimientos de atención de salud o los domicilios que acogen a pacientes con infección por 2019-nCoV presunta o confirmada?,"Para la limpieza ambiental en los establecimientos de atención de salud o los domicilios que acogen a pacientes con infección por 2019-nCoV presunta o confirmada deberían utilizarse desinfectantes que actúen contra los virus encapsulados, como el 2019-nCoV y otros coronavirus.    Hay muchos desinfectantes, como los utilizados habitualmente en los hospitales, que actúan contra los virus encapsulados.  Actualmente, la OMS recomienda utilizar: 70% de alcohol etílico para desinfectar equipo especializado reutilizable (por ejemplo, termómetros) entre usoshipoclorito sódico al 0,5% (equivalente de 5000 ppm) para la desinfección de superficies que se tocan con frecuencia en los hogares o los establecimientos de atención de salud. Para consultar las orientaciones para los establecimientos de atención de salud durante el brote de 2019-nCoV pulse en los siguientes enlaces: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected, https://www.who.int/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control-during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected-20200125. En el siguiente enlace puede consultarse más información sobre la limpieza ambiental: https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/resource-limited/environmental-cleaning-508.pdf."
¿Cuánto tiempo puede sobrevivir el 2019-nCoV sobre una superficie seca?,"En estos momentos no se dispone de datos sobre la estabilidad del 2019-nCoV sobre las superficies.  Los datos procedentes de estudios de laboratorio sobre  el SARS-CoV y el MERS-CoV demuestran que la estabilidad en el medio ambiente depende de varios factores, como la temperatura relativa, la humedad y el tipo de superficie. La OMS sigue vigilando las pruebas disponibles para el nCoV y actualizará la información a medida que se conozcan más datos."
¿Hay algún procedimiento especial en relación con los desechos procedentes de pacientes con infección presunta o confirmada por 2019-nCoV?,"No. Los desechos producidos durante la atención en un establecimiento de salud o en el domicilio de pacientes con infección presunta o confirmada por 2019-nCoV deberían eliminarse igual que nos desechos infecciosos. Para más información sobre la eliminación de desechos infecciosos, pulse aquí: https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/safe-management-of-waste-summary/en/ https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/resource-limited/environmental-cleaning-508.pdf."
¿Hay algún procedimiento especial para la gestión de cadáveres de personas que han fallecido por causa del 2019-nCoV?,No. No hay ningún procedimiento especial para la gestión de cadáveres de las personas que han fallecido por causa del 2019-nCoV. Las autoridades y los establecimiento médico deben aplicar sus políticas y reglamentos en vigor que guían la gestión post morten de las personas que han fallecido por enfermedades infecciosas.
‎¿Existe un modelo para establecer un ala de aislamiento y para los ‎tipos de productos y los requisitos sanitarios en la materia?‎,Se está elaborando un modelo para establecer un ala de aislamiento.

¿Qué es la actividad física?,"La actividad física incluye las actividadesrecreativas que impliquen movimiento, el deporte, ir en bicicleta, caminar ylas tareas físicas que se realizan en el trabajo, en casa y en el jardín. No selimita al ejercicio físico y al deporte. Jugar, bailar, trabajar en el jardín eincluso limpiar la casa y cargar con una compra pesada también es actividadfísica.Durante la pandemia de COVID-19, en la quetantos de nosotros estamos limitados en nuestros movimientos, es aún másimportante de lo normal mantenerse lo más activo posible, a todas las edades eindependientemente de nuestras capacidades. Por ejemplo, solo con dejar deestar sentados 3-5 minutos para moverse un poco, caminando o estirándose, nosayudará a reducir la tensión muscular y mental y a mejorar la circulaciónsanguínea y el estado muscular. Realizar una actividad física de forma regulartambién puede ayudar a dar una rutina al día y a mantenerse en contacto confamiliares y amigos."
¿Por qué necesitamos realizar una actividad física?,"La actividad física regular es beneficiosa tantopara el cuerpo como para la mente. Reduce la hipertensión arterial, ayuda acontrolar el peso y disminuye el riesgo de padecer enfermedades cardíacas,accidentes cerebrovasculares, diabetes de tipo 2 y diversos tipos de cáncer.También mejora la resistencia de los huesos y la fuerza de los músculos, asícomo el equilibrio, la flexibilidad y la aptitud física. Para las personasmayores, las actividades que mejoran el equilibrio ayudan a evitar caídas ylesiones. Para los niños, la actividad física practicada de forma regular favoreceel crecimiento y el desarrollo saludables y reduce el riesgo de padecerenfermedades en la edad adulta. Además, ayuda a desarrollar habilidadesfundamentales de movimiento y establecer relaciones sociales.La actividad física regular también mejora lasalud mental, reduce el riesgo de padecer depresión y deterioro cognitivo,retrasa la aparición de la demencia y mejora la sensación general de bienestar."
¿Cuánta actividad física se recomienda?,"La OMS ha elaborado recomendaciones precisas sobre la cantidad de actividad física que las personas de todas las edades deben realizar para mejorar su salud y bienestar (enlace web).[1] Estos son los niveles mínimos recomendados: Los lactantes menores de un año necesitan  moverse varias veces al día.Los niños menores de 5 años deberían realizar un mínimo de 180 minutos al día de actividades físicas, y los niños de 3 a 4 años, una actividad física moderada o intensa durante una hora al día.Los niños y adolescentes de 5 a 17 añosdeberían realizar al menos 60 minutos diarios de actividad física de moderada a intensa, como mínimo tres días a la semana, incluyendo actividades que fortalezcan los músculos y refuercen los huesos.Los adultos mayores de 18 años deberían realizar, como mínimo, un total de 150 minutos de actividad física moderada durante la semana, o 75 minutos de actividad física intensa, incluyendo actividades de fortalecimiento muscular dos o más días por semana.los adultos mayores con poca movilidad deberían realizar actividades físicas, tres o más días por semana, para mejorar el equilibrio y evitar caídas.En todo caso, cualquier actividad física es mejor que ninguna. Empiece con cantidades pequeñas y, con el tiempo, aumente progresivamente la duración, la frecuencia y la intensidad. Mantenerse activo durante la pandemia de COVID-19 es difícil para todos. Al haber menos opciones de realizar actividad física, es aún más importante organizarse el día para poder mantenerse activo y evitar pasar demasiado tiempo sentados. En pocas palabras, estamos en un momento en el que todos debemos movernos más y estar menos tiempo sentados.  [1] https://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_recommendations/es/"
¿Cómo no correr riesgos al hacer ejercicio físico durante la pandemia de COVID-19?,"No realice ejercicio físico si tiene fiebre, tos o dificultades para respirar. Quédese en casa y descanse, solicite atención médica y llame por teléfono antes de dirigirse al dispensario de salud. Siga las instrucciones de las autoridades sanitarias locales.Si puede salir a pasear o montar en bicicleta, respete siempre el distanciamiento físico y lávese las manos con agua y jabón antes de salir, cuando llegue a su destino y en cuanto vuelva a casa.  Si no puede lavarse las manos con agua y jabón, utilice un desinfectante de manos a base de alcohol. Si sale a un parque o a un espacio público abierto para caminar, correr o hacer ejercicio, respete siempre el distanciamiento físico y lávese las manos con agua y jabón, antes de salir, cuando llegue a su destino y en cuanto vuelva a casa. Si no puede lavarse las manos con agua y jabón, utilice un desinfectante de manos a base de alcohol. Respete las restricciones impuestas por las autoridades sanitarias locales sobre el número de personas que pueden ir juntas y/o sobre el uso de espacios públicos al aire libre destinados al juego o al ejercicio físico. Si no practica regularmente una actividad física, empiece lentamente con actividades de baja intensidad, como caminar y ejercicios de bajo impacto. Empiece con actividades más cortas, de cinco a 10 minutos, y aumente gradualmente hasta 30 minutos o más en unas pocas semanas. Si no está acostumbrado, es mejor y más saludable realizar la actividad física durante menos tiempo pero más frecuentemente que intentar hacerlo mucho tiempo. Elija una actividad adecuada para reducir el riesgo de lesiones y disfrutar mientras la práctica. Elija la intensidad adecuada según su estado de salud y su nivel de aptitud física. Una actividad física de intensidad ligera o moderada implica poder respirar cómodamente y mantener una conversación."
¿Cómo puedo mantenerme activo en casa?,"Intente evitar estar sentado largos periodos de tiempo, ya sea para trabajar, estudiar, ver la televisión, leer, conectarse a redes sociales o jugar a videojuegos. Cada 20-30 minutos puede levantarse 3-5 minutos. Basta con levantarse y estirarse, o mejor aún, dar un paseo por casa, subir y bajar escaleras, o caminar por el jardín. Solo con moverse y estirarse un poco mejorará su salud y bienestar. Puede consultar más opciones de estiramientos saludables con ilustraciones en (enlace web EURO[1]).Establezca una rutina para mantenerse activo todos los días, por ejemplo ejercicios o una actividad física que realice usted solo, una clase por Internet o un encuentro en línea con amigos o compañeros de trabajo para hacer juntos ejercicio físico. Fijar una hora concreta para hacer ejercicio ayuda a mantenerse activo todos los días. Póngalo en su agenda para no olvidarlo. Cúmplalo para crear una rutina y adaptarse a nuevas formas de trabajo, estudio y vida familiar en el marco de las restricciones impuestas durante la pandemia de COVID-19.Manténgase activo con su familia y amigos: organizar actividades físicas con su familia en casa y en otros lugares servirá para pasar tiempo juntos y mantenerse activos. Planificar actividades con sus hijos, como juegos dinámicos en casa, paseos por el parque o montar en bicicleta, puede ser una forma para que toda la familia se relaje, esté junta y se mantenga activa y saludable durante este periodo.   Márquese objetivos de actividad física para usted y su familia: elija un tipo específico de actividad, una hora del día y/o una duración determinada. Intente que cada miembro de la familia se fije su propio objetivo, un objetivo ambicioso pero realista con un poco de motivación y la ayuda de la familia y los amigos. Anote los progresos realizados en una tabla semanal de actividades y, si cree que puede ayudarle, concédase una recompensa por los logros alcanzados, algo que le guste.Más ideas para mantenerse físicamente activoPara lactantes menores de 1 añoJuegue periódicamente con su bebé en el suelo (boca arriba). Intente hacerlo repetidas veces a lo largo del día cuando esté despierto.Para menores de 5 añosJuegos activos en casa: invente juegos que impliquen actividades físicas en las que se desarrollen habilidades de lanzamiento, recepción, golpeo con el pie, posición corporal y equilibrio.Juegos activos con carreras y saltos para cansar a los niños.Para niños y adolescentes de 5 a 17 añosJuegos activos, individuales y en familia.Participe en clases de actividades o juegos activos en línea, o en clases de educación física en línea, o en rutinas de ejercicios adecuados para adolescentes.Prepare juegos de patio de recreo en casa, como el salto a la comba o la rayuela, invéntese juegos nuevos y pruebas para mantenerse activo. Aprenda una nueva habilidad, por ejemplo malabares. Realice actividades de entrenamiento de fuerza muscular, como levantar pesas o pesos improvisados, por ejemplo botellas llenas de agua o arena.Para adultos Suba escaleras el mayor número de veces posible; considérelo como una oportunidad para mantenerse activo. Utilice las tareas domésticas para mantenerse más activo físicamente. Realice actividades divertidas, como bailar.Siga clases de ejercicios físicos en línea o invéntese una rutina con música en la que se utilicen los principales grupos musculares y se incremente el ritmo cardíaco. Realice actividades de fortalecimiento muscular, levantando pesas o botellas llenas de agua o utilizando su propio peso corporal (flexiones, abdominales y sentadillas). [1] http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-technical-guidance/stay-physically-active-during-self-quarantine/_recache?fbclid=IwAR2RQYVYBnmpDCMjBwqmoz0hZxzmit_9yKzXu6ZhjGNywRTEzWOUQefU8V0."
¿Cuántos países afectados por el paludismo han notificado casos de COVID-19?,"Los países de todas las regiones de la OMS donde el paludismo es endémico han notificado casos de COVID-19. En la Región de África de la OMS, que soporta más del 90% de la carga mundial de paludismo, 37 países habían notificado casos de COVID-19 el 25 de marzo; de ellos, 10 países notificaron la transmisión local de la enfermedad. Los informes más recientes sobre la situación de la pandemia de COVID-19 están disponibles en el sitio web de la OMS (situation reports, solo en inglés)."
¿Deberían mantenerse las intervenciones básicas de lucha contra los vectores del paludismo dada la rápida propagación mundial de la COVID-19?,"En los últimos días, se ha informado de la suspensión de las campañas de utilización de mosquiteros tratados con insecticidas y de fumigación de interiores con insecticidas de acción residual en varios países africanos, debido a la creciente alarma generada por la posible exposición a la COVID-19. La suspensión de esas campañas hará que muchas poblaciones vulnerables, en particular niños pequeños y mujeres embarazadas, corran un mayor riesgo de contraer paludismo. La OMS alienta encarecidamente a los países a que no suspendan la planificación y la ejecución de las actividades de lucha antivectorial, en particular las campañas de distribución de mosquiteros tratados con insecticidas y de fumigación de interiores con insecticidas de acción residual, y a que presten esos servicios aplicando  las mejores prácticas disponibles para proteger a los profesionales sanitarios y a las comunidades de la transmisión de la COVID-19. Es posible que sea necesario modificar las estrategias de distribución previstas para reducir al mínimo la exposición al coronavirus. La Alianza para la Prevención del Paludismo ha proporcionado una serie de valiosas orientaciones para los programas nacionales de lucha contra el paludismo con relación a la distribución de mosquiteros tratados con insecticidas en el contexto de la lucha contra la COVID-19; esas recomendaciones son compatibles con las orientaciones mundiales de la OMS.En lo que respecta a la ejecución de las campañas de fumigación de interiores, la OMS apoya las directrices elaboradas por la Iniciativa del Presidente de los Estados Unidos contra el Paludismo en el contexto de la COVID-19. Entre otras medidas, en esas directrices se aconseja a los equipos encargados de los programas de fumigación de interiores que: aumenten el número de puestos donde lavarse las manos y el jabón disponible en todos los lugares donde se lleven a cabo esos programas; intensifiquen los reconocimientos médicos matutinos de todos los miembros de los equipos y aumenten los controles de temperatura cuando sea posible; lleven puestos mascarillas N-95 y equipo de protección personal antes de entrar en los lugares donde se realizan las operaciones; y limpien con frecuencia cualquier superficie que hayan tocado (picaportes, barras de vehículos, etc.). Además de las recomendaciones mencionadas, hay que prever la adopción de las medidas de protección básicas recomendadas por la OMS dirigidas al conjunto de la población."
¿Deberían mantenerse las terapias preventivas recomendadas por la OMS en el África subsahariana?,"Sí. La administración de tratamiento preventivo intermitente en el embarazo, la quimioprevención estacional para el control del paludismo y el tratamiento preventivo intermitente en los lactantes deberían mantenerse, siempre que se apliquen las mejores prácticas para la protección de los profesionales sanitarios y de otros trabajadores que combaten la COVID-19 en primera línea. Asegurar el acceso a esos y otros recursos básicos de prevención del paludismo permitirá salvar la vida de muchas personas; además, es una estrategia fundamental para reducir la presión sobre los sistemas de salud en el contexto de la lucha contra la COVID-19.Las nuevas orientaciones de la OMS definen los  derechos, las funciones y las responsabilidades de los profesionales sanitarios en el contexto de la COVID-19. La OMS también ha elaborado orientaciones para que los países mantengan los servicios de salud esenciales en condiciones de seguridad durante la pandemia."
¿Hay algún cambio en cuanto a las orientaciones de la OMS con respecto al diagnóstico y el tratamiento del paludismo?,Las orientaciones de la OMS siguen siendo las mismas. El diagnóstico y el tratamiento precoces son fundamentales para evitar que un caso leve de paludismo se convierta en una enfermedad grave o desemboque en la muerte. Los países no deberían reducir las actividades para detectar y tratar el paludismo; ello perjudicaría gravemente la salud y el bienestar de millones de personas afectadas por una enfermedad potencialmente mortal.
¿Qué medidas especiales adicionales pueden ser necesarias en el contexto de la COVID-19?,"Además de las estrategias que suelen adoptarse en la lucha antipalúdica, podría ser conveniente adoptar medidas especiales en el contexto de la pandemia de la COVID-19, como el retorno temporal al tratamiento de sospecha del paludismo o el uso de la administración masiva de medicamentos, que han sido eficaces en situaciones de emergencia anteriores.  El tratamiento de sospecha del paludismo consiste en el tratamiento de casos sospechosos de paludismo sin recurrir a la confirmación del diagnóstico (por ejemplo, mediante una prueba de diagnóstico rápido). Esa estrategia suele reservarse para circunstancias extremas, como en el caso en que exista la enfermedad en entornos en los que haya dejado de disponerse de pruebas de diagnóstico rápido.La administración masiva de medicamentos es una estrategia recomendada por la OMS para reducir con celeridad la mortalidad y morbilidad por paludismo durante una epidemia y en situaciones de emergencia complejas. La estrategia consiste en administrar a todas las personas de una población específica medicamentos antipalúdicos, a menudo a intervalos repetidos, con independencia de que presenten o no síntomas de la enfermedad. Esas medidas especiales únicamente deberían adoptarse tras considerar detenidamente dos objetivos fundamentales: reducir la mortalidad relacionada con el paludismo y garantizar la seguridad de los profesionales sanitarios. La OMS está estudiando la adopción de propuestas concretas sobre cuándo y cómo aplicar esas medidas; las orientaciones pertinentes se publicarán a su debido tiempo."
¿Por qué la OMS está particularmente preocupada por la propagación de la COVID-19 en las zonas afectadas por el paludismo?,"La experiencia adquirida en brotes de enfermedades anteriores ha puesto de manifiesto el efecto negativo que esos brotes tienen en la prestación de los servicios de salud y las consecuencias para enfermedades como el paludismo. Por ejemplo, el brote de Ebola que azotó Guinea, Liberia y Sierra Leona entre 2014 y 2016 debilitó la lucha antipalúdica y provocó un aumento espectacular de los casos y las muertes relacionadas con el paludismo en los tres países.En las últimas semanas, la pandemia de COVID-19 ha puesto a prueba la resiliencia de sistemas de salud muy robustos en todo el mundo. Consciente del elevado número de vidas que se cobra el paludismo en las poblaciones vulnerables de los países donde los sistemas de salud son frágiles, la OMS hace hincapié en que es fundamental mantener las medidas de prevención, detección y tratamiento de esa enfermedad. En todas las regiones deberían adoptarse medidas de protección para reducir al mínimo el riesgo de transmisión de la COVID-19 entre los pacientes, las comunidades y los proveedores de servicios de salud.  La OMS ha elaborado un conjunto detallado de  orientaciones dirigidas a los profesionales sanitarios en el contexto de la respuesta al brote de COVID-19, así como una serie de orientaciones operacionales para mantener los servicios de salud esenciales en condiciones de seguridad."
¿Cuáles son las principales consideraciones que deben tener en cuenta los países que están tratando de eliminar el paludismo o de evitar la reaparición de la transmisión?,"Todas las consideraciones expuestas anteriormente son pertinentes para los países en los que está desapareciendo el paludismo y para los que tratan de evitar su reaparición: es preciso mantener las actividades destinadas a prevenir, detectar y tratar los casos de paludismo, sin dejar de hacer lo posible para prevenir la propagación de la COVID-19 y garantizar la protección de quienes prestan los servicios conexos. Los países que están a punto de eliminar el paludismo deben proteger sus importantes logros y evitar que la enfermedad rebrote.  Los países que han eliminado el paludismo deben estar muy atentos a cualquier caso importado de la enfermedad que pueda aparecer para evitar su reintroducción."
¿Qué medidas ha adoptado la OMS para apoyar a los países afectados por el paludismo en el contexto de la COVID-19?,"La OMS está trabajando en los tres niveles de la Organización (en los países, las regiones y la Sede) para garantizar que toda orientación destinada a prevenir la propagación del coronavirus y a encauzar la gestión de la COVID-19 se adecúe a la situación de los entornos afectados por el paludismo.  Junto con sus asociados, la OMS también ha definido un conjunto de medidas interrelacionadas, necesarias para mitigar los efectos de la COVID-19 en los países más afectados por el paludismo. Recientemente, la Organización convocó a sus asociados para examinar ámbitos de colaboración y coordinación, con el objetivo de:  generar, utilizar y difundir informaciónprecisa;  mitigar las disfunciones de los sistemasde salud; y  garantizar la continuidad de los servicios básicos específicos para combatir el paludismo, sin dejar de adoptar medidas especiales complementarias en algunos entornos.La OMS está dispuesta a colaborar con los países y con otras partes interesadas para mitigar los efectos negativos del coronavirus en la lucha antipalúdica en todo el mundo y, en la medida de lo posible, contribuir al éxito de las intervenciones contra la COVID-19."
¿Se han producido interrupciones en el suministro mundial de productos básicos necesarios para combatir el paludismo como consecuencia de la pandemia de COVID-19?,"Sí. En los últimos días se ha informado de interrupciones en las cadenas de suministro de productos esenciales contra el paludismo – como mosquiteros tratados con insecticidas de acción prolongada, pruebas de diagnóstico rápido y medicamentos antipalúdicos – debido al cierre de las fábricas y de la suspensión de la importación y exportación de productos para hacer frente a la COVID-19. Se requiere una acción coordinada que garantice la disponibilidad de instrumentos esenciales para combatir el paludismo, en particular en los países con una elevada carga de la enfermedad, y que los esfuerzos por contener la propagación de la COVID-19 no comprometan el acceso a los servicios de prevención, diagnóstico y tratamiento del paludismo."
¿Cuál es la postura de la OMS respecto del uso de cloroquina e hidroxicloroquina en el contexto de la respuesta a la COVID-19?,"La OMS sigue atentamente los ensayos clínicos en curso que se están realizando para hacer frente a la COVID-19, incluidos los estudios sobre el empleo de cloroquina y su derivado, la hidroxicloroquina, para el tratamiento y la prevención de la enfermedad.  En la actualidad, no hay datos suficientes que permitan determinar la eficacia de ninguno de esos medicamentos ni en el tratamiento de pacientes de COVID-19, ni en la prevención del contagio del coronavirus. Actualmente, la OMS recomienda el uso de cloroquina para el tratamiento del paludismo por P. vivax. En el contexto de la lucha contra la COVID-19, las dosis de cloroquina e hidroxicloroquina que se están examinando actualmente y el tratamiento conexo no se corresponden con los utilizados para tratar a los pacientes de paludismo. La ingestión de altas dosis de esos medicamentos podría estar asociada a resultados sanitarios adversos o gravemente adversos. En lo que respecta a las emergencias de salud pública, la OMS dispone de un proceso sistemático y transparente de investigación y desarrollo (I+D), incluso para los ensayos clínicos de medicamentos. El plan de I+D de la OMS («R&D Blueprint») para la COVID-19, se puso en marcha el 7 de enero de 2020 y tiene por objeto agilizar la disponibilidad de pruebas, vacunas y medicamentos eficaces que puedan utilizarse para salvar vidas y evitar crisis a gran escala.  La OMS también ha elaborado un conjunto de procedimientos para evaluar el funcionamiento, la calidad y la seguridad de las tecnologías médicas en situaciones de emergencia."
¿Es mayor el riesgo de contraer la COVID-19 para las personas que viven con el VIH?,"Las personas con VIH que se encuentran en un estado avanzado de la enfermedad, presentan un recuento bajo de CD4 y una elevada carga viral o no reciben tratamiento antirretroviral corren, de manera general, un mayor riesgo de sufrir infecciones ycomplicaciones relacionadas. Se desconoce si la inmunodepresión del VIH conlleva más riesgos de contraer la COVID‑19, de modo que, hasta que no se sepa más, es preciso tomar precauciones adicionales en relación contodas las personas con VIH avanzado o poco controlado [1], [2] .Nada prueba por el momento que el riesgo de infección o de complicaciones de la COVID‑19 de las personas que viven con el VIH y se encuentran clínica e inmunológicamenteestables y reciben tratamiento antirretroviral sea mayor que el del resto de la población. Algunas personas que viven con el VIH pueden presentar factores de riesgo ya establecidos respecto de las complicaciones de la COVID‑19, como ladiabetes, la hipertensión y otras enfermedades no transmisibles y, en esa medida, estar más expuestas a los riesgos de la COVID‑19, sin que ello guarde relación con el VIH. Sabemos que durante los brotes del SARS y del MERS nose notificó más que un número reducido de casos leves de personas con VIH.Hasta la fecha, se ha reseñado el caso de una persona con VIH que contrajo la COVID-19 y se recuperó [3] y se ha llevado a cabo un pequeño estudio sobre los factores de riesgo y los antirretrovirales utilizadospor personas seropositivas con COVID-19 en China. Este estudio concluyó una incidencia de la COVID‑19 comparable a la de la población en general y un incremento del riesgo ligado a la edad, pero no a niveles bajos de CD4, niveleselevados de carga viral o tratamientos antirretrovirales.[4]Los datos clínicos actualmente disponibles indican que los principales factores de riesgo de muerte guardan relación con la edad avanzada y las comorbilidades, como las enfermedades cardiovasculares, la diabetes, las enfermedades respiratoriascrónicas y la hipertensión. Algunas personas en muy buen estado de salud también han desarrollado formas graves de la enfermedad por coronavirus [5]. Se recomienda a las personas con VIH que adopten las mismas precauciones que la población en general [6], [7]: lavarse las manos con frecuenciabuen código de conducta respiratorio distanciamiento físico solicitar atención medica si aparecen síntomasautoaislamiento de haber contacto con alguien que tenga la COVID-19 otras medidas en función de la respuesta del Gobierno Las personas con VIH que estén tomando medicamentos antirretrovirales deben hacer acopio de medicamentos para garantizar al menos 30 días y hasta 6 meses de tratamiento y asegurarse de estar al día con sus vacunas (vacunas contrala gripe y antineumocócica). También deben procurarse suficientes medicamentos para tratar las coinfecciones, las comorbilidades y las adicciones."
¿Pueden utilizarse antirretrovirales para tratar la COVID-19?,"Varios estudios han señalado los buenos resultados clínicos obtenidos con pacientes infectados por el virus causante de la COVID‑19 y otros coronavirus relacionados (SARS‑CoV y MERS CoV), casi todos los cuales experimentaron una recuperación completa. En algunos casos, se les administró un medicamento antirretroviral: lopinavir reforzado con ritonavir (LPV/r). Estos estudios se centraron principalmente en personas VIH negativas. Es importante señalar que los estudios sobre el uso del LPV/r se llevaron a cabo con considerables limitaciones. Se trata de estudios pequeños, los tratamientos dispensados presentan variaciones de tiempo, duración y dosis, y la mayoría de los pacientes recibieron simultáneamente otros tratamientos e intervenciones que pueden haber contribuido a generar los resultados observados.Si bien las pruebas de efectos positivos de los antirretrovirales en el tratamiento de las infecciones por coronavirus son muy poco concluyentes, se observaron muy pocos efectos secundarios de consideración. Entre las personas que viven con el VIH, el consumo rutinario de LPV/r para tratar el VIH está asociado a varios efectos secundarios de gravedad moderada. Sin embargo, la duración del tratamiento en los pacientes con infecciones por coronavirus no suele superar las pocas semanas, de modo que cabe prever que la incidencia de esos efectos secundarios sea baja o menor que en los consumidores habituales de esos medicamentos."
¿Pueden servir los antirretrovirales para prevenir la infección causante de la COVID-19?,"Dos estudios han abordado el uso del LPV/r como profilaxis posterior a la exposición al SARS‑CoV y al MERS‑CoV. Uno de ellos concluyó una menor incidencia de la infección por el MERS-CoV entre los trabajadores de la salud tratados con LPV/r que entre los no medicados. El segundo estudio no detectó ningún caso de infección por SARS‑CoV entre 19 personas con VIH internadas en la misma sala hospitalaria que los pacientes con SARS, 11 de los cuales recibían terapia antirretroviral. Una vez más, el grado de certeza de las conclusiones es muy bajo debido al reducido tamaño de la muestra, la variabilidad de los medicamentos administrados y la incierta intensidad de la exposición."
¿Qué estudios sobre el tratamiento y la prevención de la COVID-19 con antirretrovirales se están planificando?,"Se han planificado varios ensayos aleatorios para evaluar la seguridad y la eficacia del uso de medicamentos antirretrovirales —principalmente del LPV/r— en el tratamiento de la COVID‑19, en combinación con otros medicamentos. Se prevé obtener resultados a partir de mediados de 2020."
¿Cuál es la posición de la OMS sobre el uso de antirretrovirales en el tratamiento de la COVID19?,"Actualmente, no hay datos suficientes para evaluar la eficacia del LPV/r u otros antivirales para tratar la COVID-19. Varios países están evaluando el uso del LPV/r y otros antivirales y celebramos los resultados de estas investigaciones.Una vez más, en el marco de la respuesta de la OMS al brote, se ha activado el Proyecto de I+D de la OMS para acelerar la evaluación de las pruebas diagnósticas, las vacunas y las terapias contra este nuevo coronavirus. La OMS también ha establecido una serie de procedimientos para evaluar el funcionamiento, la calidad y la seguridad de las tecnologías médicas en situaciones de emergencia."
¿Cuál es la posición de la OMS sobre el uso de corticoesteroides en el tratamiento de la COVID-19?,"En este momento, la orientación provisional de la OMS sobre el tratamiento clínico de infecciones respiratorias agudas severas presuntamente relacionadas con la COVID-19 es no administrar corticoesteroides, a menos que estén indicados por otra razón.[8]Esta orientación se basa en varias revisiones sistemáticas que señalan la falta de eficacia y los posibles daños del tratamiento habitual de corticoesteroides en casos de neumonía viral o de síndrome de distrés respiratorio agudo.[9]"
"Si los países utilizan antirretrovirales para tratar la COVID 19, ¿pueden las personas que viven con el VIH verse afectadas por un problema de escasez de esta medicación?","Los antirretrovirales son un tratamiento eficaz y sumamente tolerable para las personas que viven con el VIH. Se están llevando a cabo investigaciones sobre el antirretroviral LPV/r para determinar su idoneidad como tratamiento de la COVID‑19. Si se decidiera usar el LPV/r para tratar la COVID-19, debería disponerse un plan para garantizar un suministro suficiente y continuado que cubriera las necesidades de todas las personas con VIH que ya toman LPV/r y de las personas que necesiten empezar tratamiento. Sin embargo, las personas tratadas con LPV/r representan un porcentaje relativamente bajo, ya que es usado como tratamiento de segunda línea, de acuerdo con las orientaciones de la OMS sobre el VIH. Todo país que autorice el uso de medicamentos contra el VIH para tratar la COVID‑19 debe garantizar un suministro suficiente y sostenible."
¿Cómo podemos garantizar los derechos humanos y luchar contra la estigmatización y la discriminación?,"A medida que se intensifican a nivel mundial las respuestas de salud pública a la pandemia de COVID-19, se exhorta a los países a adoptar medidas contundentes para controlar la epidemia. La OMS ha instado a todos los países a lograr un equilibrio adecuado entre la protección de la salud, la prevención de perturbaciones sociales y económicas y el respeto de los derechos humanos.  La OMS colabora con asociados, como el Programa Conjunto de las Naciones Unidas sobre el VIH/SIDA (ONUSIDA) y la Global Network of People Living with HIV, para asegurarse de que los derechos humanos no se erosionan como consecuencia de las respuestas a la COVID-19, y velar por que se ofrezca a las personas infectadas y afectadas por el VIH el mismo acceso a los servicios que al resto de la población y que los servicios relacionados con el VIH se presten sin interrupciones.Es fundamental tener en cuenta las prisiones y los centros de detención para inmigrantes en la respuesta de salud pública más amplia para mitigar los posibles brotes de COVID-19 en las cárceles y reducir la morbilidad y mortalidad entre las personas en cárceles y otros lugares de reclusión. Esto implica una colaboración estrecha entre los ministerios de salud y de justicia e incluye intervenciones como protocolos para el cribado de entrada, medidas de protección personal, distanciamiento físico, limpieza y desinfección del entorno y restricción de movimiento, incluida la limitación de traslados y acceso de personal no esencial y visitantes. En el contexto actual, es sumamente importante que los países se esfuercen por elaborar estrategias no privativas de libertad para prevenir el hacinamiento en entornos de reclusión.[10] La gestión de la salud en las cárceles por el ministerio de salud en lugar del ministerio de justicia u otro ministerio afín probablemente facilitará esta tarea.[11]"
¿Cómo pueden los programas garantizar el acceso continuado a los servicios relacionados con el VIH?,"Es importante garantizar el acceso continuado a los servicios esenciales de prevención, ensayo o tratamiento del VIH, incluso en los lugares donde se apliquen medidas de confinamiento como parte de la respuesta de salud pública a la pandemia de COVID-19. Si bien debe mantenerse el acceso a servicios esenciales, también deben estudiarse y aplicarse medidas adaptadas y de base empírica para reducir la posible transmisión, entre ellas las siguientes:[12] Tomar las precauciones habituales para todos los pacientes, es decir, asegurarse de que todos los pacientes se cubren la nariz y la boca con un pañuelo de papel o la parte interna del codo cuando tosan o estornuden, ofrecer una mascarilla médica a los pacientes con COVID-19 presunta mientras esperan a ser atendidos en el servicio de salud, promover la higiene de manos, etc.Los trabajadores sanitarios y los queofrecen servicios de proximidad, así como los educadores y usuarios,deberían aplicar medidas adaptadas de higiene de manos.Garantizar la selección, elreconocimiento temprano y el control de la fuente de la infección (aislandoa los pacientes con COVID-19 presunta).Asegurarse de que todas las zonas delas instalaciones sanitarias están correctamente ventiladas.En la medida de lo posible, sedebería mantener una separación de al menos un metro entre todos lospacientes en todos los tipos de servicios.Los procedimientos de limpieza ydesinfección se deberían seguir de manera sistemática y correcta.Dispensar medicamentos (para el tratamiento del VIH, la tuberculosis yotras enfermedades crónicas, como la dependencia de los opioides) paraperiodos más largos a fin de disminuir la frecuencia de las visitas de lospacientes.Considerar la reducción de los servicios a los más esenciales(prestación de servicios esenciales de tratamiento y prevención; otrosservicios, como las sesiones de asesoramiento, se pueden reducir o adaptar).En general, las poblaciones vulnerables, incluidos los miembros de sectores clave de la población, así como las personas sin hogar o desplazadas pueden estar más expuestas a la infección debido a comorbilidades adicionales que afectan a su sistema inmunitario, su menor capacidad para aplicar las medidas de confinamiento y distanciamiento social, así como el acceso generalmente limitado a los servicios de salud. Es fundamental que los servicios que llegan a estas poblaciones, como los servicios comunitarios, los centros de encuentro y los servicios de divulgación, continúen prestando servicios vitales de prevención (distribución de condones, agujas y jeringuillas), pruebas y tratamiento, y garanticen al mismo tiempo la seguridad del personal y los usuarios. Los servicios se pueden adaptar en función de las consideraciones anteriores cuando proceda."
¿De qué sirve recetar y dispensar antirretrovirales y otros medicamentos para varios meses?,"Los adultos, niños, adolescentes y mujeres embarazadas y lactantes clínicamente estables, así como miembros de sectores clave de la población (consumidores de drogas inyectables, profesionales del sexo, hombres que tienen relaciones con hombres, personas transgénero y personas en cárceles y otros lugares de reclusión) pueden beneficiarse de modelos simplificados de tratamiento antirretroviral; por ejemplo, las recetas y la dispensación de medicamentos para varios meses (acopio para 3-6 meses) reducirán la frecuencia de las visitas a entornos clínicos y garantizarán la continuidad del tratamiento durante las posibles limitaciones de movimiento por el brote de COVID-19. También se debería estudiar la posibilidad de dar a las personas clínicamente estables que sigan un tratamiento de sustitución con metadona o buprenorfina más opciones para tomar los medicamentos en casa a fin de reducir la carga adicional para el sector de la salud."
¿Pueden las mujeres embarazadas y en puerperio con VIH transmitir el virus de la COVID-19 al feto o al lactante?,"Se dispone de pocos datos sobre la presentación clínica de la COVID-19 en segmentos específicos de la población, como niños y mujeres embarazadas,[13] pero las conclusiones de un estudio breve publicado indican que actualmente no hay pruebas que demuestren la infección intrauterina por transmisión vertical en mujeres que desarrollan neumonía asociada a la COVID-19 en las fases finales del embarazo.[14]  Aunque no se ha documentado la transmisión vertical, la transmisión después del parto mediante el contacto con secreciones respiratorias infecciosas es motivo de preocupación.  Los lactantes de madres con COVID-19 presunta, probable o confirmada deberían ser alimentados conforme a las directrices habituales sobre la alimentación del lactante[15] y aplicar las precauciones necesarias para la prevención y control de infecciones. Como ocurre en todos los casos confirmados o presuntos de COVID-19, las madres sintomáticas lactantes o que practiquen el contacto directo de la piel o el método madre canguro deberían mantener una buena higiene respiratoria, incluido durante la alimentación del lactante (por ejemplo, mediante el uso de una mascarilla médica cerca del niño cuando la madre presente síntomas respiratorios), lavarse las manos antes y después del contacto con el niño, y limpiar y desinfectar las superficies con las que la madre sintomática haya estado en contacto.[16]Preguntas frecuentes sobre la COVID-19, el embarazo, el parto y la lactancia materna"
¿Se debería administrar un tratamiento diferente a las mujeres embarazadas y lactantes con VIH que hayan contraído la COVID-19 y a sus bebés?,"Actualmente se desconoce si existen diferencias entre las manifestaciones clínicas de la COVID-19 o el riesgo de enfermedad grave (o de peligro graves para el feto) en mujeres embarazadas o no embarazadas o en adultos en edad reproductiva. Las mujeres embarazadas con COVID-19 confirmada o presunta, en particular en las primeras fases del embarazo, deberían recibir una atención de apoyo y tratamiento de la enfermedad que tenga en cuenta las adaptaciones inmunológicas y fisiológicas durante y después del embarazo, las cuales podrían solaparse con los síntomas de la COVID-19. Los datos son limitados, pero, hasta que los conocimientos de los que se dispone no aporten información más precisa, se debería prestar una especial atención a las mujeres embarazadas con otras afecciones y que pudieran haber contraído la COVID-19. En el momento de la publicación de esta información, no se han notificado fallecimientos de mujeres embarazadas;[17] sin embargo, tal vez se deberían priorizar las pruebas de detección de COVID-19 en mujeres embarazadas sintomáticas para facilitar el acceso a atención especializada. Todas las mujeres que se hayan quedado embarazadas recientemente y que hayan contraído la COVID-19 o se hayan recuperado de esta enfermedad deberían recibir información o asesoramiento sobre la alimentación segura, así como medidas apropiadas de prevención y control de infecciones para prevenir la transmisión del virus de la COVID-19.[18]En caso de COVID-19 confirmada o presunta, el tratamiento es el mismo que para las mujeres no embarazadas, con aislamiento adecuado. Se debe notificar y preparar a los servicios ginecológicos y señalar que los lactantes de madres con COVID-19 confirmada deben considerarse «personas objeto de investigación» y ser aislados conforme a las orientaciones sobre prevención y control de infecciones. Actualmente se desconoce si los lactantes con COVID-19 corren un mayor riesgo de sufrir complicaciones graves."
¿Corren los fumadores y los consumidores de tabaco mayor riesgo de contraer la COVID-19?,"Es probable que los fumadores sean más vulnerables a la COVID-19, ya que el acto de fumar supone arrimar los dedos (y los cigarrillos, que pueden estar contaminados) a los labios, lo que aumenta la posibilidad de transmisión del virus de la mano a la boca. Los fumadores también pueden padecer una enfermedad pulmonar o una capacidad pulmonar reducida, lo que potencia enormemente el riesgo de enfermedad grave.Ciertos artefactos usados para fumar, como las pipas de agua, suelen conllevar el uso compartido de boquillas y mangueras, lo que puede facilitar la transmisión de la COVID-19 en ambientes comunitarios y sociales.Las afecciones que incrementan las necesidades de oxígeno o reducen la capacidad corporal de darle un uso adecuado conllevan un mayor riesgo de sufrir afecciones pulmonares graves como la neumonía."
¿Supone la COVID-19 un mayor riesgo para las mujeres embarazadas?,"Se están investigando las consecuencias de la infección de la COVID 19 en las mujeres embarazadas. Disponemos de datos limitados, pero no hay pruebas de que corran mayor riesgo de enfermedad grave que la población en general. Sin embargo, debido a las transformaciones que experimentan sus cuerpos y sistemas inmunitarios, sabemos que las mujeres embarazadas pueden verse gravemente afectadas por algunas infecciones respiratorias. Es importante, por tanto, que tomen precauciones para protegerse contra la COVID-19 y que informen al personal médico que las atienda sobre eventuales síntomas (en particular, fiebre, tos o dificultad para respirar).             La OMS seguirá revisando y actualizando la información y las orientaciones que ofrece a medida que disponga de más datos."
Estoy embarazada. ¿Cómo puedo protegerme contra la COVID-19?,"Las embarazadas deben tomar las mismas precauciones que el resto de la población para evitar la COVID-19. Usted puede protegerse:Lavándose las manos con frecuencia con un desinfectante de manos a base de alcohol o con agua y jabón.Manteniendo una distancia física con las demás personas, y evitando lugares concurridos.Evitando tocarse los ojos, la nariz y la boca.Observando una buena higiene respiratoria. Supone cubrirse la boca y la nariz con el codo flexionado o con un pañuelo al toser o estornudar. El pañuelo usado debe ser desechado inmediatamente.Si tiene fiebre, tos o dificultad para respirar, busque enseguida asistencia médica. Antes de acudir a un centro médico llame por teléfono y siga las instrucciones de su autoridad médica local.  Las mujeres embarazadas y las que hayan dado a luz recientemente -incluidas las afectadas por la COVID-19- deben acudir a sus citas médicas de rutina."
¿Debería someterse a las mujeres a pruebas de la COVID-19?,"Los protocolos sobre las pruebas de laboratorio y los criterios de selección de las personas sometidas a dichas pruebas varían en función de su lugar de residencia.Ahora bien, la recomendación de la OMS es dar prioridad a las embarazadas que presenten síntomas de la COVID-19. Si tienen la COVID-19, es posible que necesiten recibir atención especializada."
¿Puede la COVID-19 transmitirse de una mujer a su bebé durante el embarazo o tras el parto?,"Todavía no sabemos si una mujer embarazada puede transmitir el virus a su feto o bebé durante el embarazo o el parto. Por ahora, no se ha detectado al virus en muestras de líquido amniótico o leche materna."
¿Qué atención debería dispensarse durante el embarazo y el parto?,"Todas las mujeresembarazadas, incluso cuando se sospeche o se haya confirmado que tienen laCOVID-19, tienen derecho a recibir atención de alta calidad antes, durante ydespués del parto. Esto incluye atención de salud prenatal, neonatal, postnatal, intraparto y mental.               Una experiencia de parto segura y positiva implica:Ser tratada con respeto y dignidad;        Estar acompañada por una persona de su elección durante el parto;     Comunicación clara del personal del servicio de maternidad;Estrategias adecuadas de alivio del dolor;Movilidad en el trabajo de parto, de ser posible, y elección de la postura del parto.  Si se sospecha o se ha podido confirmar que la embarazada tiene la COVID-19, los trabajadores de la salud deberían tomar todas las precauciones adecuadas para reducir su riesgo de infección y el de terceros, incluida la higiene de manos y el uso de indumentaria de protección como guantes, bata y mascarilla médica."
¿Deben las embarazadas dar a luz por cesárea si se sospecha o se ha podido confirmar la COVID-19?,No. El consejo de la OMS es que las cesáreas se lleven a cabo únicamente cuando estén médicamente justificadas. El tipo de parto debe determinarse de modo personalizado y de acuerdo con las preferencias de la mujer y las indicaciones obstétricas.
¿Pueden amamantar las mujeres con COVID-19?,"Sí. Una mujer con COVID-19 puede amamantar a su bebé si así lo desea. Debería:Observar una buena higiene respiratoria mientras amamanta a su bebé, usando mascarilla, si hay mascarillas disponibles;Lavarse las manos antes y después de tocar el bebé;Limpiar y desinfectar de manera rutinaria las superficies que haya tocado."
¿Puedo tocar y tener en brazos a mi bebé recién nacido si tengo la COVID-19?,"Sí. El contacto directo y temprano, así como la lactancia materna exclusiva ayudan al bebé a desarrollarse. Debería: Amamantar observando una buena higiene respiratoria;Tener en brazos a su bebé, piel con piel; y Compartir una habitación con su bebé.Debe lavarse las manos antes y después de tocar a su bebé y mantener todas las superficies limpias."
Tengo la COVID-19 y estoy demasiado enferma para amamantar directamente a mi bebé,"Si está demasiado enferma para amamantar a su bebé debido a la COVID-19 u otras complicaciones, debería recibir apoyo para alimentarlo con leche materna de alguna manera posible, viable y aceptable para usted. Estas podrían ser las opciones:Extracción de lecheRelactaciónLeche de donante humana"
¿En qué se parecen el virus de la COVID-19 y el virus de la gripe?,"En primer lugar, los virus de la COVID-19 y de la gripe tienen presentaciones clínicas muy parecidas. Es decir, ambos causan enfermedad respiratoria, con una gran variedad de casos, desde afecciones asintomáticas o leves hasta enfermedades graves y muertes.En segundo lugar, ambos virus se transmiten por contacto, gotitas y fómites. Por consiguiente, las mismas medidas de salud pública, como la higiene de manos y un buen código de conducta respiratorio (toser en el codo o en un pañuelo, desechándolo de inmediato), son medidas importantes que pueden adoptarse para prevenir la infección."
¿En qué se diferencian el virus de la COVID-19 y el virus de la gripe?,"La velocidad de transmisión marca una diferencia importante entre ambos virus. El virus de la gripe tiene un periodo de incubación medio más corto (el tiempo que pasa desde la infección hasta la aparición de síntomas) y un intervalo de serie más corto (el tiempo transcurrido entre casos sucesivos) que el virus de la COVID-19. Se estima que el intervalo de serie del virus de la COVID-19 es de entre 5 y 6 días, mientras que en el caso del virus de la gripe es de 3 días. Esto significa que la gripe puede propagarse más rápidamente que la COVID-19. Además, la transmisión en los primeros 3 a 5 días de la enfermedad, o transmisión potencialmente presintomática -transmisión del virus antes de la aparición de síntomas-, es un importante factor de transmisión de la gripe. Por el contrario, si bien estamos comprobando que hay personas que pueden transmitir el virus de la COVID-19 en las 24 o 48 horas anteriores a la aparición de síntomas, no parece por ahora que se trate de un importante factor de transmisión. Se calcula que el número reproductivo -el número de infecciones secundarias generadas a partir de un individuo infectado- del virus de la COVID-19 se sitúa entre 2 y 2,5, más que la gripe. Sin embargo, las estimaciones realizadas sobre los virus de la COVID-19 y de la gripe se inscriben en contextos y periodos muy específicos, lo cual dificulta las comparaciones directas. Los niños son importantes vectores de transmisión del virus de la gripe en la comunidad. En el caso del virus de la COVID-19, los primeros datos indican que los niños se ven menos afectados que los adultos y que las tasas de ataque clínicas del grupo de edad de 0 a 19 años son bajas. Otros datos preliminares de estudios sobre la transmisión en el hogar realizados en China sugieren que los niños se infectan de los adultos, más que al revés. Si bien la gama de síntomas de ambos virus es similar, la proporción de pacientes con afecciones graves parece variar. En el caso de la COVID-19, los datos reunidos hasta la fecha sugieren que el 80% de las infecciones son leves o asintomáticas, el 15% son infecciones graves, que requieren oxígeno, y el 5% son infecciones críticas, que requieren ventilación. Estas fracciones de infección grave y crítica parecen más elevadas que las observadas en el caso de la infección gripal. Quienes corren mayor riesgo de contraer una infección gripal grave son los niños, las mujeres embarazadas, las personas mayores, las personas con afecciones crónicas subyacentes y las personas inmunodeprimidas. En el caso de la COVID-19, consideramos actualmente que la edad avanzada y las afecciones subyacentes incrementan el riesgo de infección grave.La tasa de mortalidad de la COVID-19 parece mayor que la de la gripe, especialmente la gripe estacional. Aunque se tardará un tiempo en determinar con exactitud la verdadera tasa de mortalidad de la COVID-19, los datos reunidos hasta ahora indican que la tasa de mortalidad bruta (el número de muertes notificadas dividido por el número de casos notificados) oscila entre el 3% y el 4%, si bien la tasa de mortalidad por infección (el número de muertes notificadas dividido por el número de infecciones) será menor. En el caso de la gripe estacional, la tasa de mortalidad suele ser muy inferior al 0,1%. Sin embargo, la tasa de mortalidad depende en gran medida del acceso a la atención de la salud y a la calidad de esta."
¿Qué intervenciones médicas hay disponibles para combatir los virus de la COVID-19 y de la gripe?,"Hay una serie de terapias actualmente sometidas a ensayos clínicos en China y más de 20 vacunas en fase de desarrollo contra la COVID-19, pero no se dispone en este momento de vacunas o terapias autorizadas para la COVID-19.  Por el contrario, hay antivirales y vacunas disponibles para la gripe. Aunque la vacuna contra la gripe no es eficaz contra el virus de la COVID-19, se recomienda enérgicamente vacunarse todos los años para prevenir la infección de la gripe."

Questions


Can cats/dogs/hamsters or other pets catch the cold? 
How quickly do they recover?

","Yes they can. The viruses that cause a cold include rhinoviruses (up to 80%), coronaviruses and influenza (together accounting for much of the remaining 20%) and a small percentage of adenoviruses. When discussing cross species transfer, influenza is the most important to discuss as it is a fairly common cause of the ""common cold"". 

Influenza A has humans, pigs, bird and horses as its host. Different influenza strains have different hosts. Influenza can recombine if two strains infect the same host (antigenic shift) and also mutate (antigenic drift). With a combination of these influenza can and has numerous times crossed the species barrier which has caused the major flu pandemics as well as swine and avian flu. It's this reservoir that makes these viruses so hard to eradicate. When we are the only host such as in polio virus, it is a lot easier. Pigs don't adhere to national flu guidelines. 

Comparing recovery times, all mammals are roughly similar although due to our slightly more evolved immune system as well as social factors of knowing what to do when we are ill we recovery very slightly earlier.
"
"It's my understanding that the majority of symptoms associated with the common cold (runny nose, inflamed sinus, slight fever) are essentially the result of the immune system's response.

I've never heard of someone dying of the common cold (unlike influenza), even in immune compromised people. As such, what damage would the cold virus inflict if there was no immune response? Would it be catastrophic?
","Can someone die of the common cold?

No. 
The common cold is a clinical syndrome restricted to upper respiratory tract involvement. By clinical syndrome, I mean it is the constellation of symptoms (rather than the consequence of a specific pathogen). As you mention, these symptoms are the result of the immune response, rather than tissue damage or compromised function as a direct effect of a pathogen or its toxin (e.g., the watery diarrhea in cholera).  

As defined (see, e.g., Cecil Medicine Ch. 369), this clinical syndrome cannot lead to death. 


  The common cold is an upper respiratory syndrome of rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction, frequently accompanied by sore throat, sneezing, and cough.


Can the viruses that cause the common cold cause death?

Yes. Many viruses that cause the common cold also cause other clinical syndromes that can cause death. This occurs when viral replication moves to the lower respiratory tract. As an example, influenza viruses are responsible for 25 - 30% of common colds (see Bennett, Principles and Practice of Infectious Disease, Ch.58). When it moves beyond the upper respiratory tract, influenza is responsible for substantial mortality. Other virus families that are responsible for both a common cold syndrome and lower respiratory tract syndrome in immunocompetent individuals (e.g., bronchiolitis, pneumonia) include parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and (rarely) coronavirus. Rhinovirus, responsible for 40-50% of common cold cases, is uniquely unsuited to lower respiratory tract involvement, because of its preference for the cooler environment of the nasal mucosa, replicating best at 33 C (Murray Medical Microbiology, Ch 56). However, in individuals with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), lower respiratory tract involvement does occur. There are a number of case series reporting death due to lower respiratory rhinovirus. This is an example.

Can the common cold lead to serious illnesses other than lower respiratory tract involvement?

Yes. Other morbidity can occur as a result of the immune response that produces the common cold syndrome. Rhinorrhea and congestion can progress to a viral rhinosinusitis, a separate syndrome with its own complications, or a secondary bacterial infection, which can lead to bacterial sinus involvement and/or bacterial lower respiratory tract infection. Otitis media is another common complication, especially in children, and has its own potential complications. Asthma (and, generally speaking, most lung diseases) can also be exacerbated by what would otherwise be a simple common cold and predisposes to lower respiratory tract involvement. Asthma does deserve special mention, because rhinovirus associated exacerbations can be fatal, but this is a consequence of asthma rather than a common cold syndrome. Further discussion of these syndromes are beyond the scope of the question, but are discussed briefly in the chapters referenced above.

"We would buy a mobile air purifier in our home. 

Against the smoke of the city, etc. 

It would have a HEPA + activated carbon filter. They are marketing it as: 


  ""filtration process captures 99.97% of airborne particles down to 0.1
  micron in size.""


and having also: 


  ""encapsulated ion particle charging chamber""


But the question: 

Would the mentioned filter+ion charger also help cleaning the air from bacteria and viruses? 

Ex.: ""Coronavirus/2019-nCoV"" is about ""Coronavirus virions are spherical with diameters of approximately 125 nm"" - but I just Googled it, not from an official source. And 0.1 micron is 100 nm. 

UPDATE: would it be more effective, if it would have UV-C light in the air purifier? 
","The aforementioned filter will filter microbes

Yes, it is routine practice to use microfiltration in labs to sterilize solutions from microbes. 0.2 micron filters will remove all typically-found bacteria most of the time, except for the odd bacteria here and there, though this is uncommon. 0.1 micron filters certainly remove all stray bacteria that may make it through upon a single 0.2 micrometer filtration. Here is a nice read on the appropriateness of 0.2 and 0.1 microfilters, which simply states that 0.2 micro filters are usually more appropriate since they additionally guarantee a better flow rate.

The aforementioned filter will NOT ensure filtration of viruses

These filters are not used, suitable nor effective for viruses, however. You ask specifically about the coronavirus. From a 2015 study:


  Coronaviruses are members of the Coronaviridae group and contain a
  single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome surrounded by a corona-like
  helical envelope (Ryan 1994). The SARS virus genome consists of 29,751
  base pairs. Approximately 41% of the genome is GC base pairs while 59%
  is TA base pairs. Coronaviruses have a size range of 0.08-0.15
  microns; with a mean size of 0.11 microns (see Figure 1).


This means 0.1 micron filters will not protect you from these viruses. They may help you reduce viral count in the air, which may of course be sufficient, but this would not be an adequate measure in a biological safety facility.

The cost-effectiveness of commercial air-purifiers for biosafety vs. pollution

On a advice-related note: I do not think air-purifiers are going to help you in a cost-effective manner to avoid viruses (e.g. Rhinoviruses that cause the common cold, for instance), lest you stay at home all the time. You expose yourself outdoors, and carry plenty of viruses indoors on your body and in your respiratory tract; these will bypass your filtration system on the daily. Being healthy and lucky enough to avoid exposure to viruses outside the house is still the best bet. I think an air purifier has a greater potential to help with smog and urban pollution, those particles are typically larger than the diameter of most microbes.

"Why do coronaviruses come from bats?

I mean, why precisely coronaviruses and not (for instance) herpesviruses?
It looks like bats host more zoonotic viruses (per species) than rodents, although they don't develop any sign of disease.

The article above says that rodents host more zoonotic viruses than bats overall (68 against 61), but at the same time most of the latest pandemics originated from bats.

It also seems that bats could be involved in the maintenance of ebola viruses.

My question is: why did these major pandemics originate from bats and not from rodents, although rodents host more zoonotic viruses overall?

We should also take into consideration that human-rodent interaction is usually more likely than human-bat interaction, except for people who consume bats (like Chinese people; this would (partially) explain why both SARS and 2019-nCoV developed in China).
","
  The preponderance of links between bat and human pathogens has led to a debate about whether bats disproportionately contribute to emerging viral infections crossing the species barrier into humans (26–30). Given the diversity of the Chiroptera order (Figure ​(Figure1),1), we may simply see more bat viruses because there are so many (>1,300) species of bats (31). However, even when accounting for the fact that they make up ~20% of extant terrestrial mammals, bats are overrepresented as reservoir hosts of pathogens with a high potential for spilling into human populations (32, 33). In fact, no known predictors that have been described to impact the likelihood of crossing the species barrier, including reservoir host ecology, phylogenetic relatedness to humans or frequency of reservoir-human contact, explain this pattern (32). Thus, why bats are such a frequent source of pathogenic human viruses remains a tantalizing mystery.

"How do bats survive their own coronaviruses (without showing any symptoms)?

Or, more generically, how can viruses keep reproducing inside healthy carriers without inducing any pathogenic effect?

Are coronaviruses able to replicate themselves without harming bats, or maybe these viruses are just latent like herpesviruses in humans?



Related question: Why are bats the source of dangerous coronavirus pandemics?
","It's common for the reservoir host of a zoonotic virus to be tolerant of it. MERS coronavirus appears to cause mild or no disease in dromedary camels ( source ), but kills about 35% of confirmed infected humans. ( CDC ) Sin Nombre hantavirus seems to be mild in the deer mice that spread it, despite ~36% fatality rate in humans. ( source ) Mosquitoes are efficient vectors for flaviviruses like dengue and zika in part because they have adaptations we lack that protect them from the virus. ( source ) Also, human communities are host to several viruses: about 90% of people have a herpesvirus infection ( source ) with similar numbers for polyomaviruses. ( source ) Very few of these infected individuals show symptoms.
The wide prevalence of these asymptomatic infections shows that the virus is successful when it can replicate while the host remains healthy. In general, virus reproduction kills cells, and when cells die faster than the host can replace them, this causes symptoms up to and including death. The host's immune system supresses virus activity, and a virus that can't evolve ways to avoid immune supression will be wiped out. But if the virus gets so good at avoiding the immune system, it will kill the host, which is bad for the virus. So both host and virus tend to evolve to a point where the immune system wins most, but not all of the time. There is a lot more to it, but I'll stop here.

In conclusion, we don't really need to look for special properties of bats to explain their tolerance of coronaviruses, even though, as iayork points out, there are reasons to expect bats might be more resistant.
"
"Can coronaviruses mutate to an extent to get as dangerous as fliovirusues such as Marburg viruses, Ravn or Ebola Zaire? 
","'Dangerous' is quite a subjective term, and can be defined in different ways.

Viruses vary in their pathogenicity, which is essentially the ability of the virus to cause a disease in a single individual. This can influence other factors, such as the case fatality rate, which is the proportion of people who die from the disease once they have contracted it. For example, the Ebola virus has a very high case fatality rate of up to 90%.

However, those aren't the only ways in which you could define 'dangerous'. We might also consider the total number of people that the virus can kill. This often isn't a linear relationship with the case fatality rate. Often, viruses with a high case fatality rate 'burn out' before than can inflict a global pandemic, because people die before they can spread the disease on to others. Vice versa, viruses with a relatively low case fatality rate, such as the Spanish Flu (2-3%) can be extremely 'dangerous' and kill millions of people. 

But there is no hard and fast rule, as the propensity of a virus to cause a global pandemic is influenced by many, many other factors. 

So to answer your question: is it possible for the Covid-19 to mutate into something as dangerous as Ebola? Well, if we are thinking about it's pathogenicity - Influenza A H5N1 (bird flu) had a case fatality rate of about 60%, which is pretty high for a flu virus. For context, the seasonal flu which has a case fatality rate of about 0.1%. I'm not an expert in Virology, so it would be great if someone with more knowledge could confirm this, but it seems very unlikely that the Covid-19 virus could acquire mutations to the degree where it would kill as high as 90% of the people who acquire it, like Ebola does. Ebola is a hemorrhagic virus, which is a totally different mechanism of pathogenicity to the Coronavirus family.  

It's plausible that Covid-19 could obtain mutations which allow it to transfer more quickly between humans. For example, we know that the Spanish Flu acquired mutations in hemagglutinin subtype which allowed it to be more transmissible between humans. Generally, Coronaviruses have relatively lower R0 rates than other disease (~2/3 compared to Measles which is 12-18). The total number of people killed by the Ebola outbreak was about 11,000. Covid-19 has already killed ~3000 (although the exact figure is hard to quantify), so it seems like on the global level, Covid-19 will be more dangerous than Ebola, if we consider the total number of people killed. 
"
"How do biologist trace evolutionary history of virus, is there any article on this issue,
e.g. how scientist got to know that coronavirus evolved from bat or camel or pig?
","The identification is done by sequencing virus samples and comparing them to reference genomes of viruses. By doing this, you can analyze how closely related an unknown virus is to the references. 

For the nCoV this method shows it is 96% identical with a known bat coronavirus (see reference 1 for details). 
As viruses accumulate mutations due to errors during replication, this method is also used to generate genetic trees of the virus to analyze how it spreads, map routes of infection and also if the virus has been introduced to humans more than once (reference 2 has a nice overview on this topic).

The problem here is: You need to have some known references for comparision, if you have a completely new virus which has never emerged before, this will not help. For this reason there are projects ongoing which collect samples to identify yet unknown viruses (see reference 3)

"Sorry for my lack of understanding, Why now, when people been eating bats for centuries? If bats are simply a vector, where does that virus come from?
","Bats are reservoirs of many important human pathogens, some are emerging infections (e.g., 2019-NCoV, the coronavirus in the news recently), and some are not (e.g., rabies). 

Contact between humans and bats is certainly not a new phenomena, but there is more required for an emerging infection than a reservoir and a new host. There must be some bridge that allows a virus to cross a previously effective species barrier. For SARS, there was an intervening amplifying host, the palm civet.  We've now had long enough to study the molecular biology, so this is now quite well described:


  Once SARS-CoV had jumped from bats to civets, it underwent further mutations in civets. The first K479N mutation allowed SARS-CoV to jump from civets to humans and the second S487T mutation allowed SARS-CoV to transmit from human to human, leading to the severe SARS outbreak in 2002–2003.


It may be useful to understand that, as they are RNA viruses, coronaviridae have a high error rate, increasing the rate of mutation. Additionally, making a species jump may allow for novel recombination.
"
"To reduce the risk of infection by viruses (including 2019-nCoV) the CDC suggests:


Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.


To my knowledge most alcohol-based hand sanitizers use ethanol. In clinical settings sometimes isopropanol is also used.

Question: How exactly do alcohols, especially ethanol and isopropanol provide some disinfecting action against viruses? Are the virus particles simply dissolved? What happens?
","Alcohols dissolve lipid bilayers

Many viruses have an outer lipid bilayer. Ethanol lyses cells, and in the same fashion damages membrane-bound viruses by rupturing the bilayer (which is made of ethanol-soluble lipids). 

Alcohols misfold the protein coats of viruses

Additionally, alcohols denature proteins, which misfold in non-aqueous conditions. Some viral surface proteins are important for adhesion and attachment, and misfolding these renders the virus inactive. The total breakdown of viruses is essentially due to the misfolding of their protein coat (the capsid).

The same goes for bacteria

With the additional effect of dehydrating cells

Alcohols substitute the water contents of a tissue and have been as such used as fixatives. Common laboratory examples include methanol and ethanol.

Typically, 70% (140 proof) ethanol is used for bench wiping to kill or inactivate microbes. This includes viruses.

This is all standard, common, easily and readily accessible knowledge. Here's a bonus source.

"What do we know about the environmental limits for nCoV to survive outside the body? For example, in: 


In open air
On surfaces
In water


What are the limits for temperature, humidity and air pressure, where the virus, can or cannot survive?
","Because ""any"" Coronavirus is so dangerous, much research have been done on viruses with similar properties. They are called ""surrogates"". Because nCoV is new, we don't have any studies, so we need to estimate it's behavior from previously studied similar viruses.

Here:

RH   = Relative Humidity. 
Tr   = Room Temperature
TGEV = Transmissible Gastroenteritis (surrogate)
MHV  = Mouse Hepatitis (surrogate)


Viral survival for the TGEV/MHV surrogate:


on stainless steel:      4°C @ 20% RH:  28 days
in water/sewage (TGEV):  25°C: 22 days
in water/sewage (MHV):   25°C: 17 days
contaminated water is a potential vehicle for exposure if aerosols are generated


For airborne Human Coronavirus 229E (HCV/229E):


Optimal survival:  6°C @ 50% RH: 
Poor* survival:     20°C @ ""High"" relative humidity (RH)
(* ""poor"" in terms of 20°C but varying RH.)


For SARS CoV-P9:


Serum: 96 h = 4 days
Sputum &amp; Feces: 96 h = 4 days
Urine: 72 h = 3 days


For SARS-CoV (GVU6109):


in diarrheal stool (at low pH): 4 days
in respiratory/air droplets:  >7  days @ 20°C (Tr)
in respiratory/air droplets:  >20 days @ 4°C



  ""The main route of transmission of SARS CoV infection is presumed to be respiratory droplets. However the virus is also detectable in other body fluids and excreta. The stability of the virus at different temperatures and relative humidity on smooth surfaces were studied. The dried virus on smooth surfaces retained its viability for over 5 days at temperatures of 22–25°C and relative humidity of 40–50%, that is, typical air-conditioned environments. However, virus viability was rapidly lost (>3 log10) at higher temperatures and higher relative humidity (e.g., 38°C, and relative humidity of >95%).""
  
  ""We and others have reported that infectivity of SARS CoV (SARS coronavirus) was lost after heating at 56°C for 15 minutes but that it was stable for at least 2 days following drying on plastic.""




UPDATE: 2020-03-13

From [7]: 


  ""We found that viable virus could be detected in aerosols up to 3 hours 
  post aerosolization, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on 
  cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel. HCoV-19 and 
  SARS-CoV-1 exhibited similar half-lives in aerosols, with median 
  estimates around 2.7 hours. Both viruses show relatively long viability 
  on stainless steel and polypropylene compared to copper or cardboard: 
  the median half-life estimate for HCoV-19 is around 13 hours on steel 
  and around 16 hours on polypropylene. Our results indicate that aerosol 
  and fomite transmission of HCoV-19 is plausible, as the virus can remain 
  viable in aerosols for multiple hours and on surfaces up to days.""


For SARS-CoV-2:
Experiments were performed @ 40% RH and 21-23°C.


Copper (Cu):      4 hours
Stainless (Fe):   48 hours (2 days)
Cardboard:        24 hours 
Plastic:          72 hours (3 days)
SARS-CoV-2 is most stable on plastic and stainless steel.

"There seems to be a bit of a conspiracy theory brewing over some data in the NCBI database, and I don't have the necessary knowledge to make sense of it.

It basically goes like this:


Go to NCBI BLAST
Click on the big Protein BLAST button
Enter AVP78033 in the main search box and click BLAST
Click on the first result that shows a 100% match and click ""See 5 more title(s)"" in the first entry


This shows that the search is a complete match for a Bat SARS-like coronavirus protein from a 2018 research paper, for Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (which the NCIS site indicates is an alias for 2019-nCoV), and for Bat coronavirus from 29 Jan 2020.

My question is - why would a protein from Bat SARS-like coronavirus and 2019-nCoV be showing up as a perfect match for one another? Does this mean that 2019-nCoV might actually be a previously-discovered coronavirus that very recently started infecting humans? Or could it be that a recently collected sample from Wuhan was mis-identified as 2019-nCoV when it is actually the same coronavirus from the 2018 submission? 

Clicking around the links on that site seem to bring up dozens of similar but different pages that I don't have the knowledge to distinguish, but the Accession column from the search results described above contains a link to this page, which says that it is a provisional refseq and acknowledges that it is identical to the bat coronavirus:


  PROVISIONAL REFSEQ: This record has not yet been subject to final
              NCBI review. The reference sequence is identical to QHD43418.
              Annotation was added using homology to SARSr-CoV NC_004718.3.


Can somebody who actually understands these things please make sense of this?
","2019-nCoV is a virus that originated from the bat (at least this is the current hypothesis). It shows 96% squence similarity to the BatCoV RaTG13 sequence (see reference 1), showing its origin.

It still is 87,99% identical to the ""Bat SARS-like coronavirus"", which explains the hit you found and is not unexpected, as these viruses are very closely related (see reference 2). 

These viruses are closely related, so I wouldn't expect too many differences at all. Then envelope proteins can be critical for function/structure of the virus, so mutations there might occur less frequent. And if they occur, I would only expect few changes over time, so with this little time gone, probably no mutation is seen yet. Additionally, due to the redundancy caused by the codon degeneracy, not every mutation in the genomic material translates into changes in the protein.

"In CNN's video Scientist says Coronavirus vaccine could be ready by 2021 after about 00:25 'Robin Shattock, the Head of Mucosal Infection and Immunity at Imperial College London' says:


  We were able to access the sequence that was published by Chinese scientists and made globally available, which was a tremendous thing to do. And we went from that sequence to identifying part of the sequence that encodes for the surface proteins of the virus. And we’re using that sequence to manufacture our vaccine.
  
  We’re using a particular approach where we make a synthetic vaccine based on RNA, so essentially it’s essentially genetic code, we package that in essentially a lipid droplet, and use that to inject in a muscle; it expresses that protein, and the body recognizes that as foreign and it makes protective antibodies.


I'm assuming that this is mRNA and so once it reaches the cytoplasm of the vaccine recipients muscle cells it will be expressed and somehow returned to the cells' membrane where it will be recognized as foreign by passing lymphocytes.

Questions:


Is this basically correct as far as it goes? 
If so, what causes the lipid droplet to fuse with muscle (or other) cells in the first place?

","I can't give an authoritative answer on this because my PhD work was based on mRNA delivery using peptides instead of lipids, but many of the concepts are the same. I also don't have time to provide proper citations, but this is probably too much for a comment.

Anyway, mRNA is a very fragile molecule, it can be broken down extremely quickly in the blood by serum nucleases. Therefore we must protect the mRNA by mixing it with some other chemical, in this case a mixture of positively charged lipids. The positively charged lipids are attracted to the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the mRNA, and form a nanoparticle trapping the mRNA inside and hiding it from the nucleases. The lipids are often, but not always, PEGylated, which means that a molecule of polyethylene glycol (PEG) is attached to the lipid. The PEG groups form a layer on the outer surface of the nanoparticle that helps prevent protein binding.

These mRNA lipid nanoparticles are then injected into a patient. This will probably be an intramuscular injection so that the particles are most likely to be taken up by muscle cells. The exact mechanism explaining why lipid nanoparticles are attracted to cells isn't entirely clear, but it's likely a combination of electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nanoparticle and the negatively charged cell membrane and proteins that bind to the nanoparticle and are then recognized by receptors on the cell surface.

After the particle is taken up by a cell it is usually trapped inside a membrane-bound structure called an endosome. As the endosome matures it is acidified, and as the pH drops from about 7 to about 5.5 the nanoparticle is disrupted. The lipids that made up the nanoparticle can merge with the lipids that make up the endosomal membrane, disrupting that membrane and breaking open the endosome, allowing the mRNA to escape into the cytoplasm.

Once in the cytoplasm the mRNA will find a ribosome and produce protein. Just like you said, the protein in this case will be membrane bound and expressed on the outer surface of the cells for eventual immune recognition.

"(Not sure if this is the right SE for this question. I'm asking this here, because I'm looking for a biological answer, if one exists.)

This (potentially very naive) question is inspired by this news article: Bats for sale at Indonesia's wildlife market despite virus warning


  Bats, rats and snakes are still being sold at an Indonesian market known for its wildlife offerings, despite a government request to take them off the menu over fears of a link to the deadly coronavirus.


Why would the government request to take the meat of these animals off the market? Even if they're linked to the coronavirus, the virus presumably can be killed by cooking the meat prior to consumption. After all, protein denatures well before 100 degrees celsius, and once it denatures the organism should die. Conceivably the virus could affect the handlers of these animals prior to their being cooked, but not the consumers.

Some paragraphs later in the article illustrate my confusion:


  Restaurateur Lince Rengkuan -- who serves bats including their heads and wings stewed in coconut milk and spices -- says the secret is preparation.
  
  ""If you don't cook the bat well then of course it can be dangerous,"" she said.
  
  ""We cook it thoroughly and so far the number of customers hasn't gone down at all.""


Which is effectively what I've been thinking, but:


  ""We're also urging people not to consume meat from animals suspected to be carriers of a fatal disease,"" said Ruddy Lengkong, head of the area's government trade and industry agency.


How are these two seemingly-contradictory positions reconciled?
","Restaurateur Lince Rengkuan is correct - once the bat meat is cooked the coronavirus will die, and the meat is safe to consume.

The Indonesian government isn't imposing restrictions for biological reasons, but for other reasons; these other reasons are out of scope of this SE.

"I have read a lot about the outbreak of the coronavirus, I know that in january scientists had already sequenced the viral genome.

How was the virus identified prior to the sequencing

Given that viruses are not like germs that you can see and distinguish readily in microscope, how could scientists know that there was something new about the new disease and how could they purify the pathogen that cause that disease without knowing what it is and without knowing its genetic code?

Where can I find information about procedures that are used to identify new viral pathogens?

Given that there is a group of people with suspicious desease, what are the laboratory procedures used to eliminate known pathogens and how you discover that you have a novel virus without knowing its genetic sequence (and without the ability to extract it - as far as I know you can not isolate virus particle with tweezers...).

Thank you!    
","This is basic epidemiology. When medical professionals notice that a group of people with some characteristic in common, are being seen for a similar disease, they ask if there's a connection. In this case, several people in Wuhan were diagnosed with severe pneumonia, and the doctors noticed that they worked in the same location. 


  Three adult patients presented with severe pneumonia and were admitted to a hospital in Wuhan on December 27, 2019. ... Her occupation was retailer in the seafood wholesale market. ... He had been a frequent visitor to the seafood wholesale market.


--A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China, 2019

You're more likely to follow up when the disease is unusual or severe, and when the connecting factor is unusual or suspicious. In this case, the severe pneumonia was presumably unexpected, and live animal markets always have potential for disease transmission. 

(In fact, it's quite possible that the virus had been circulating in the region for weeks before this cluster was noticed, and that previous cases had not been surprising enough to trigger the research needed to identify a new virus; though it's also likely that the medical personnel in Wuhan had noticed that there were an usually high number of pneumonia cases and were already looking for a connection.)

See also the answers to How did scientists discover HIV?. Old-fashioned epidemiology is always critical.

The same article explains how the virus was sequenced:


  Bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid samples were collected in sterile cups to which virus transport medium was added. ... RNA extracted from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid and culture supernatants was used as a template to clone and sequence the genome. We used a combination of Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing to characterize the virus genome. 


And isolated:


  ... supernatant from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid samples was inoculated onto the apical surface of the cell cultures. ...  After three passages, apical samples and human airway epithelial cells were prepared for transmission electron microscopy. ... 


So briefly, they took patient samples, grew them on cultured cells, used electron microscopy to check the kind of virus. They sequenced fluid (not cells, since the virus would be secreted into the fluid, making it a relatively pure source of virus RNA) and then sequenced using a standard high-throughput sequencing approach; knowing the likely kind of virus would make this easier but isn't essential. There would have been lots of human RNA in the sequence, but it's easy to bioinformatically separate that out and limit your analysis to the viral sequences. The virus isolate was also not essential for the identification; knowing the sequence is the critical information today. But having a virus isolate certainly makes all the subsequent work much easier.

This is pretty standard modern molecular biology, not an esoteric skill.

","This is a poly(A) tail, which is a feature found in the majority of eukaryotic RNAs (especially mRNA) and is also not uncommon in RNA viruses (which essentially mimic endogenous mRNA for their own replication). As with mRNA, this poly(A) tail in coronaviruses is bound by poly(A) binding protein in the cytoplasm [1], which is involved in translation initiation. In coronaviruses, this poly(A) tail is also necessary for replication independent of its role in translation [2].

"From a TV news report of a press conference from (I think) the German Robert Koch Institute, I remember hearing an expert declare that he was expecting COVID-19 to get less deadly over time.  Unfortunately, I don't know what press conference it was (I'm not sure if it was the Robert Koch Institute — it might also have been the Charité university hospital) and cannot find such a stated expectation on the internet.

Why would an expert express this expectation?

Is it because we're heading toward summer (at least where most COVID-19 cases have been reported), or is it a standard pattern, perhaps either due to people's immune systems or due to the virus evolving and becoming weaker? 
","While the data are much too sparse and noisy to give an answer about what is happening to COVID-19's virulence (the technical term for the ""deadliness"" of an infectious disease), or to forecast what will happen to its virulence in the future, there are indeed theoretical reasons that one might expect the virulence to decline in the future.

There is an entire theoretical literature on the evolution of virulence (e.g. see Read 1994, or see Wikipedia); Robert May and Paul Ewald are two researchers who contributed seminal ideas. The basic idea is that infectious 'organisms' (including viruses) may face a tradeoff between their ability to produce lots of infectious particles (e.g. by replicating faster within the host) and the length of time that they can stay in the host before it dies or activates immune defenses sufficiently to end the infection. In this case, some intermediate level of virulence may evolve.

Evolution of virulence in ways predicted by the theory has been observed in the real world in such diseases as myxomatosis (a viral disease of rabbits). The theory has also been suggested to apply in HIV and syphilis.

The actual forecast can depend on many details of the biology and epidemiology of a particular organism. If COVID-19 happened to have a higher-than-optimal virulence in humans at the time of emergence, we could expect its virulence to decline over time. It could also decline if epidemic control was applied in such as way as to differentially affect more-virulent strains; this has been suggested by Tang et al. on the basis of the pattern of mutations in different strains, although their logic has also been criticized on Twitter by an expert in genetic epidemiology, and now by a more official rebuttal by McLean et al. (with some back-and-forth discussion between the authors and critics).

This explanation doesn't include the possibility of host evolution, which is theoretically important but not really relevant to COVID-19 &mdash; it would only happen over many generations, and only if the epidemic was so severe that it was a significant overall cause of death or failure to reproduce ...

"According to 

Coronavirus has mutated at least once


  The novel coronavirus that has infected thousands of people across the
  world may have mutated at least once — meaning there may be two
  different types of the virus causing illnesses, a new study conducted
  by Chinese scientists suggests.
  
  Scientists with Peking University’s School of Life Sciences and the
  Institut Pasteur of Shanghai in a preliminary study found that one
  strain — type “L” —  of the virus was more aggressive and accounted
  for about 70 percent of the strains analyzed. The second — type “S” —
  was less aggressive and accounted for about 30 percent of analyzed
  strains.


But also several webpages theorized the virus has mutated before passing from animals to humans. 

This page What we know about the Wuhan virus says


  This virus belongs to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses.
  Named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces, they infect mostly
  bats, pigs and small mammals. But they mutate easily and can jump from
  animals to humans


and


  Where did the new coronavirus come from? The new virus likely came
  originally from bats, scientists say. It isn’t known exactly where or
  how it jumped to humans, though. Viruses from bats often infect
  another mammal first and then mutate to become more transmissible to
  humans.


though


  Coronaviruses can also jump directly to humans, without mutating or
  passing through an intermediate species.


Is something more known about this? Is it possible the virus has mutated twice in a period of time of months?
","This question makes a number of incorrect assumptions and I don't have time to correct them. The short answer is that the virus has mutated probably hundreds of times since it entered humans in late 2019. 

The lower figure on the NextStrain.org ncov page, ""Diversity"", shows the known mutations that have been identified so far. As I look at it now, there are maybe 100-200 shown there, but that will change daily and I can't be bothered to count them.

Is it possible the virus has mutated twice in a period of time of months? Of course it is. That's what we expect from coronaviruses. It would be shocking if it did not. 

The default assumption (based on a vast amount of experience with coronaviruses and many other viruses) is that these mutations are neutral and do not affect the virus in terms of fitness, virulence, or transmissibility in any way; they are occasionally useful in tracking sources, but unless you have spent a lot of time looking at virus phylogenetic trees for several years, your interpretations of these mutations are almost certainly wrong.

An example of people making claims based on unfamiliarity with virus evolution is the ""two different types of the virus"" claim. That claim is addressed by MacLean and colleagues in their Response to “On the origin and continuing evolution of SARS-CoV-2”. Summary:


  Two of the key claims made by this paper appear to have been reached by misunderstanding and over-interpretation of the SARS-CoV-2 data, with an additional analysis suffering from methodological limitations

"
"I have tried to find an answer to this but have not found anything after multiple attempts.

The question on the table is if the human body is able to produce an immune response to the COVID-19 virus if one has been exposed? This would apply most specifically to persons that have been tested positive but have ""survived"" (i.e. not having succumbed to the serious lung complications that have caused deaths for some persons). 

A follow on question that comes from this is if the human body is able to mount a suitable defense does the current practice of keeping people in quarantine for two weeks allow for this defense to reach full effectiveness? 
","We probably won't really know for certain until we have time to gather more data from survivors. However, infection with existing coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV, genetically very similar to the COVID-19 virus SARS-CoV-2; ref. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0695-z) suggests that those who are infected and survive may develop temporary immunity (ref. https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/04/two-scenarios-if-new-coronavirus-isnt-contained/):


  The toll of a seasonal-flu-like coronavirus also depends on immunity — which is also scientifically uncertain. Exposure to the four endemic coronaviruses produces immunity that lasts longer than that to influenza, Webby said, but not permanent immunity. Like respiratory syncytial virus, which can re-infect adults who had it in childhood, coronavirus immunity wanes.
  
  “Everyone, by the time they reach adulthood, should have some immunity to some coronavirus,” said Tim Sheahan, a coronavirus researcher at University of North Carolina’s Gillings School of Global Public Health. But because it doesn’t last, older people can get reinfected. The elderly also have a higher death rate from coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, a pattern 2019-nCoV is following.
  
  “There is some evidence that people can be reinfected with the four coronaviruses and that there is no long-lasting immunity,” Dr. Susan Kline, an infectious disease specialist at of the University of Minnesota. “Like rhinoviruses [which cause the common cold], you could be infected multiple times over your life. You can mount an antibody response, but it wanes, so on subsequent exposure you don’t have protection.” Subsequent infections often produce milder illness, however.


It might also be possible that someone was infected with two different strains of SARS-CoV-2 and did not develop immunity from the first infection. But it could have also been a continuation of the first infection, or testing error. Without virus sequence data, it was not possible to determine what happened for certain (ref. https://www.wired.com/story/did-a-woman-get-coronavirus-twice-scientists-are-skeptical/):


  What could be worse than getting the pneumonia-like illness now known as Covid-19? Getting it twice.
  
  That’s what Japanese government officials say may have happened to a female tour bus guide in Osaka. The woman was first diagnosed with Covid-19 in late January, according to a statement released by Osaka’s prefectural government Wednesday. She was discharged shortly after, once her symptoms had improved. A subsequent test came back negative for the virus. Three weeks later she returned with a sore throat and chest pain and tested again. For a second time, she tested positive for Covid-19.
  
  News reports detailing the case raised the possibility that people may not be developing immunity to the new coronavirus, even after they’ve recovered. But several infectious disease specialists say there’s not enough data to support that conclusion. Another possibility is that the virus subsided and flared up again. (Some viruses tend to do that.) Or the test was simply wrong.


If someone was infected twice, comparing the genomic sequences of the virus over time would have helped determine that with more certainty.
"
"Let there be a sample of 10,000 people.

100 of them have a fever. You test them for COVID19 and they all come out positive.
5 of them die, 9 of them end up in intensive care.
The estimated mortality is 5%, and estimated intensive care rate is 9%.
What about the 9,900 asymptomatic people who did no get tested?

Scenario A: All 9,900 asymptomatic people would test negative for COVID19.
Scenario B: All 9,900 asymptomatic people would test positive for COVID19 because of a combination of high rate of asymptomatic carriers and high false positive rate.
End result:

Scenario A: true mortality rate is 5% and true intensive care rate is 9%.
Scenario B: true mortality rate is 0.05% and true intensive care rate is 0.09%.
the numbers are fictitious, but the point is simple - we can't estimate mortality without knowing the prevalence

Question:

Where are we right now between scenario A and scenario B? Or put another way, are there any ongoing studies/reports which take into account this factor?
","I think you're talking (setting aside false-positive/low-specificity testing problems for the moment) about the difference between infection fatality ratio (IFR, fraction of infected people who die from disease) and the case fatality ratio (CFR, fraction of clinically defined ""cases"" who die from disease). The difference between these two depends completely, as you suggest, on the difference between the population that gets infected and the population that is defined as a ""case"" (which could vary a lot: is it people who have a cough? fever &amp; cough? request testing? are admitted to the hospital? are admitted to the ICU?).

Because most of the people aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship were tested (3063/3711), we can have a reasonably good idea of the fraction infected (unlike the usual scenario where most asymptomatic cases are never noticed). The authors of this (not yet peer-reviewed) study concluded that:


  the all-age cIFR on the Diamond Princess was 1.2% (0.38–2.7%) and the cCFR was 2.3% (0.75–5.3%)


(where 'c' in cIFR and cCFR stands for 'corrected'; these are estimates that account for the fact that we don't yet know the outcome for all patients).

Other issues to think about:


sensitivity and specificity of testing (false positive/negative rates)
variation with/adjustment for age (discussed in the paper)
variation by medical/social context (e.g. Wuhan vs Iran vs places where cases are caught early and the medical infrastructure isn't overwhelmed)

"I am confused about the needed ratio of bleach to water required to disinfect COVID-19 from surfaces.

The guide on CDC states that: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/cleaning-disinfection.html


  Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application and proper ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted.  
  
  Prepare a bleach solution by mixing:  
  
  5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water or  
  
  4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water


This is a 2% ratio. My problem is that it is not clear what ""bleach"" means. Chemically I guess it's Sodium hypochlorite. What's not clear is that what is the strength of the solution I can buy in shops.

Wikipedia states that bleach in stores can be anything between 3-25%.

Does CDC recommend the final strength of Sodium hypochlorite : water to be 2% or ""bleach in stores"" : water to be 2% (which can be anything between 0.06% - 0.5%

Disregarding this confusing CDC direction: What is the scientific recommendation for the required sodium hypochlorite : water ratio needed for disinfecting COVID-19 from surfaces?
","Perhaps I can help answer your microbiology question which is really about SARS-CoV-2 which is an enveloped mRNA virus. There is a lot of misunderstanding about SARS-CoV-2 and the medical disease it causes, COVID-19. The confusion is understandable as this is a novel coronavirus with a high rate of transmission &amp; people around the globe are still in a learning curve about it. It's important to understand how to decimate SARS-CoV-2 whenever possible. I'm an RDN &amp; years ago I went to grad school on an Allied Health Traineeship thanks to citizens of the U.S.A. Although now retired, as well as having been a clinician, I'm a former prof. I believe in giving back to society which has supported me.

Many pieces in the press unfortunately use terms of SARS-CoV-2 and then COVID-19 interchangeably, which they should not. This adds to public confusion. Keep in mind that disinfection in this instance pertains to decimation of the virus SARS-CoV-2 per se.

Cleaning should precede disinfection. Disinfection is biocidal elimination on fomite surfaces of microorganisms, in this instance SARS-CoV-2. After applying disinfecting dilution be sure to allow it adequate action time and then allow surface to air dry.

When CDC says to use “5 tablespoons (aka 1/3 cup) bleach per gallon of water” or “4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water” that is in effect 1000 ppm. CDC guidance assumes household bleach concentration to be 5-6.25%, even though most NaOCl manufacturers int the U.S.A. went to 8.25% back around 2012-2013. Check any bottle you have (or box it came in) for the NaOCl concentration for that batch of bleach. When first manufactured concentration is higher, but over time actual available free chlorine level drops and adequate potency passed by 1 year out from manufacturing date. If stored at higher room temperature, cut that down to 6 months which is more realistic. Adequate 1000 ppm of NaOCl for enough time (minimum 1 minute) can kill SARS-CoV-2.  If the non-porous fomite surface happens to be a countertop where inadvertently later food might be placed on, then after first cleaning, then disinfecting, be sure to rinse with potable H2O, then use a sanitizing solution dilution and allow to air dry.

See: ""COVID-19 – Disinfecting with Bleach"" from Michigan State U Center for Research on Ingredient Safety which will explain how to read date code of manufacturing on a household bleach (NaOCl) bottle and how much bleach to add to cold water in order to reach what is effectively a 1000 ppm dilution if bleach is still ‘fresh enough’ aka adequate concentration in bottle as purchased. The bleach concentration bottle code information can be read as follows (quoted or paraphrased from article):
Example: code E619337.
●First two characters E6 identify the company facility that manufactured the bleach. 
●Second two numbers 19 tell the year the company manufactured the bleach.
●Last three numbers 337 tell the day of the year the company manufactured the bleach.
So, code E619337 tells us this bottle of bleach was manufactured at facility E6 in 2019 on the 337 day of the year (using a Julian calendar), which is December 3.
This bottle of bleach technically expires one year from December 3, 2019, so it needs to be used or disposed of by December 2, 2020. 
Similarly a  product code A420027 tells us the product was manufactured at facility A4 in 2020 on the 27 day of the year, which is January 27. The product expires one year from January 27, 2020, so it needs to be used or disposed of by January 26, 2021. 
Adjust the Julian calendar keeping in mind the year as 2020 is a leap year. 
From experience using test strips with bleach concentrate dilutions, often that expiration timeline is closer to 6 months (commercial settings open bottle only 1 month).
canr.msu.edu/news/covid-19-disinfecting-with-bleach

Public Health Ontario has an online ""Chlorine Dilution Calculator"" to help anyone determine how much NaOCl  ""household"" bleach of a given concentration level to add to how much safe tap water to achieve a certain ppm of diluted chlorine sol'n. One can calculate sanitizing or even disinfecting diluted chlorine sol'n levels using the online calculator. Although the site is in Canada, they kindly include both English and Metric units. https://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/health-topics/environmental-occupational-health/water-quality/chlorine-dilution-calculator

Edit: The question is really about disinfecting for SARS-CoV-2, the mRNA virus which causes COVID-19 in humans.
The edit is to:
1) Clarify the actual question, which deals w/ microbiology relating to SARS-CoV-2, not a medical disease condition COVID-19;
2) Acknowledge that the press has incorrectly used the two different terms interchangeably creating public confusion &amp; explain why many professionals are responding in forums around the world trying to clear up that confusion by providing accurate information;
3) Include current full rather than shortened links to details of NaOCl disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 with enough detail that if links are later unavailable readers will still know what to do.

"A couple of colleagues suggested in a discussion that the virus that causes COVID-19 appears to be made by humans, since nature could not have produced such an efficient virus — that spreads so fast and whose patients are contagious quite some time before showing signs of infection.

Since my knowledge of biology is very limited, my only counterargument for such a conspiracy theory was along the following lines:


there is a consensus that the most probable source of the first infection was in an animal market in China.
since that animal market was actually composed of a plethora of animals belonging to various species (mixed with humans), a virus had a bigger chance of evolving a mutation that might infect an individual from another species (a thing that is way less unlikely in the wild since many of those animals do not sit close to each others or next to humans).


Clearly, I have made a little story that might be quite far away from how SARS-CoV-2 infected humans, so I am interested in a scientific arguments to support my cause.

Question: What are the main scientific arguments that can be used to debunk COVID-19 being engineered by humans?

Answers that also include explanations more accessible to laymen are greatly welcomed.
","At the moment, there is very little scientific literature about this, but I found two papers that address the problem and are fairly easy to understand. You can find them in the references. Reference 1 is probably the most interesting and is the basis for this answer.
Edit: It is also interesting to read reference 2 on the origin of SARS-CoV-2, the article also addresses some of the conspiracy theories.

As far as I can see, there are a few major points taken up by conspiracy theories.

1. SARS-CoV-2 leaked from a lab, in which research on the Bat CoV (RaTG13) was done:

Unlikely, since both viruses share only around 96% sequence homology which translates into more than 1100 sites where the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 viruses is different from RaTG13. The mutations are distributed throughout the viral genome in a natural evolutionary pattern, making it highly unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 is a direct descendant from RaTG13. For comparison, the original SARS-CoV and the intermediate host palm civet SARS-like CoV from which it originated shared 99.8% sequence homology, showing a much closer relation.

2. The S (spike) protein from bat SARS-CoV cannot be used to enter human cells via the human ACE2 receptor and therefore has been adapted in the lab:

This is untrue, since a 2013 study of a novel bat corona virus was published showing the ability of the virus to enter cells via the ACE2 receptor. See reference 3 for details.

3. The spike protein of SARS-CoV contains a unique inserted sequence (1378 bp) located in the middle of its spike glycoprotein gene that had no match in other coronaviruses:

As shown in reference 4, the sequence comparision of the SARS-CoV-2 with closely related other corona viruses shows that this sequence is not unique to the new virus but is already present in older strains. It shows some difference due to inserted mutations.

4. The claim that SARS-CoV-2 contains four insertions from HIV-1:

The paper claiming this has now been retracted due to severe criticism, and additionally a renowned HIV expert published an analysis (reference 5) demonstrating that the HIV-1 claimed insertions are random rather than targeted.

5. The claim that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is completely man-made:

To design such a ""weapon grade"" virus in the lab, the design would usually start from a known virus backbone and then introduce logical changes (for example, complete genes from other viruses). This cannot be seen in the genome of the virus, rather you see randomly distributes changes throughout the genome coming from virus evolution and not directed cloning. It is more likely that this virus originates from the recombination of a bat CoV (to which it is closely, but not directly related) and another, not yet known CoV in an intermediate host, like the palm civet for the 2003 CoV.

"From my basic understanding: The viruses causing Ebola, Sars and Covid-19 are all the result of a zoonosis, meanings that the viruses have passed from animals to humans.

So my question is: Are all recently (let's say 100 years) emerged viral diseases, with potential for a global epidemic, the result of a zoonosis?
","To my knowledge, yes. A partial list of recently emerged/emerging viral diseases (I certainly could have missed some), with probable reservoir hosts:


Chikungunya* (birds, rodents)
coronaviruses (SARS [bats], MERS [camels], COVID-19 [?? bats ?? pangolins ??])
Ebola and other filoviruses (Marburg): (bats?)
Hendra, Nipah (bats)
Ross river virus* (various mammals)
HIV (primates)
influenza (H1N1, avian) (birds/pigs)
monkeypox (monkeys, duh; also rodents)
West Nile virus* (birds)
Zika* (? ""a wide range of animals in West Africa"")


Starred examples are vector-borne (so perhaps of slightly lower concern - might not fit your criterion of ""capable of causing a global pandemic"").

Omitted: 


older zoonotic viruses (rabies, dengue, hepatitis, ...)
non-viral zoonoses (malaria, plague, anthrax)


A list of zoonoses; another from US CDC

More generally, the only other place an emerging virus could come from would be from mutation or recombination of existing human viruses. I'm not aware of such an example.
"
"As a non-biologist, my understanding is SARS-CoV-2 uses it spike protein to latch on to the ACE2 receptor on cells in order to inject its genetic material into the cell.

Questions:


What would happen if you flooded a person with exogenous ACE2 proteins? 
Would the virus attach to these decoy proteins and thereby save cells from being infected? 
Would the injected proteins cause unwanted side effects? 
Has this approach to treating viral infections been tried before?

https://f1000research.com/articles/9-72
","This is indeed a reputable strategy (#1,2,4) for rapid response to novel pathogens.  See https://phys.org/news/2020-01-scientists-decoy-molecule-neutralizes-arenaviruses.html and the open access article it cites https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13924-6

In the case of coronavirus, however, there is an issue (your #3) in that ACE2 is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of a circulating hormone, angiotensin II, which is responsible for maintaining high (or normal) blood pressure.  So the ""bait"" used would have to be at least somewhat altered from this.  You would probably have to take into account how it affected other protein interactions such as with integrin beta 1 ... (see articles like https://europepmc.org/article/MED/14754895 ) to avoid getting caught up in speculation, it makes sense that a neutralizing protein might be made from part of ACE2 just as a neutralizing monoclonal antibody could be made, but you still have to have something specific before you can test for safety and efficacy.

"The corona virus appearantly does not like high temperature:
High Temperature and High Humidity Reduce the Transmission of COVID-19
Also it seems that higher body temperatures helps the immune system to work better: Elevated body temperature helps certain types of immune cells to work better, evidence suggests 

Should therefore someone who suspect they may have the corona virus or possibly another cold virus and do not experience fever try to elevate their body temperature slightly (say 0.5-1 degrees celsius) by dressing extra warm?

This is postulated here.

Does this sound plausible to you?
","SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have spilled over into humans from a Rhinopholus (horseshoe bat) reservoir. During flight, bats' body temperature is maintained at levels associated with fever in other mammals. Rhinolophus bats are reported to reach skin temperatures of 41 C during flight. (From this review which describes why bats might be special sources for zoonotic viruses)
So, this virus is likely adapted to survive higher temperatures than a human host.
"
"TL;DR

What's the relationship between the following?


Mutation rates (expressed as ""mutations per year"" for a virus like e.g. COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). E.g. this article mentions ""The rate looks to be about 24 mutations per year""
Actual virion replication error rates in a single host cell, measured as e.g. error rates per released virion from the infected cell, i.e. (# of mutated released virions) per infected cell.




Assumptions

I would assume that mutations happen at a single virion-cell level because there are differences in e.g. nucleotides in RNA  between:


the virion infecting a cell (e.g. ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2)
the released virions from that same single cell


If so, wouldn't one argue that:


replication errors (at the nucleotide and thus released virion level) can easily happen, potentially billions of times during the infection of a single host organism
there is no ""single successful"" mutation or RNA variant within a host, rather, we have a distribution of RNAs, many of which could be simultaneously transmitted to another host organism?


Further context

I quote from e.g. this paper:


  On a per-site level, DNA viruses typically have mutation rates on the order of 10E-8 to 10E-6 substitutions per nucleotide site per cell infection (s/n/c). RNA viruses, however, have higher mutation rates that range between 10E−6 and 10E−4 s/n/c


Again, wouldn't that mean that a single host could 1) easily generate many mutations of the same virus and 2) pass most of those uniquely generated mutations to another host? If so, how come we can simply say ""24 mutations (over time) per year""? 
","Since no one else has done so, just gonna expand on what occurred here in the comments (mostly from @Alex Reynolds):

tl;dr: natural selection exists.

Longer version:


Mutations/replication errors/whatever will happen in the creation of new virus particles within a host cell. There is some distribution of number of mutational events that will occur as a function of the number of new RNA molecules created per cell and the replication error rate. Some subset of these RNA molecules will be packaged into new particles, yielding a new generation of viruses that get a chance to infect. Yes, this is potentially a large number of new mutations per infection event.
Some large proportion of these new particles will contain non-functional RNAs, due to inactivating mutations of one kind or another. Most of the new mutations will be worse at being a virus than the originally infecting virus (their immediate parent). So therefore, they will be outcompeted by non-mutated forms.
Among all those viruses which continue successfully infecting throughout the course of a year, on average we observe 24 substitution mutations in the genome over the course of that year. Every transmission chain included in the group of viruses at the end of the year must have remained viable for infection of hosts. In other words, it has survived natural selection.


In population genetics, this phenomenon is known as ""mutation-selection balance""- e.g. new mutations arise in the population at a rate that is limited by the action of natural selection (at equilibrium).

Genotype-phenotype maps

What of course I am leaving unstated is exactly why ""...new mutations will be worse at being a virus than the originally infecting virus...""

This is very hard to predict in many cases. In some cases it is very obvious why a mutant is bad at being a virus, if e.g. an essential gene is deleted from the RNA genome. But for many single mutations we don't really understand what their effect will be on virus function, we just observe that they drop out of the population due to negative selection. 

If you are interested in this question, I recommend looking into genotype-phenotype maps. I know Jesse Bloom has done some work on influenza in this field, here is one example of such a paper. It is generally extremely laborious to do this kind of work, so relatively little is known about the functional effect of any specific mutation in any specific genome.

Hope it is helpful to have all that written out.

"I keep hearing people are recovering from COVID-19 virus. Is there any chance that same person can become infected with COVID-19 for a second time? 
","Short answer: Although there are some reports on this, it is pretty unlikely. It is more likely that patients where released too early from hospital, developed further symptoms later on and got worse, was re-hospitalized, tested again for SARS-CoV2, which was positive and counted as re-infected. 

Another possibility is that a false negative test happened, when people got re-tested later the test was positive again and the patient was counted as re-infected. Given the rising number of cases worldwide this should become evident pretty soon, if this is a real problem and not an artefact. For the moment, I don't think there is enough evidence for the re-infection of the same patient in such a short time period. If this holds, future will tell.

Long answer: There is now an experimental paper, which infected rhesus macaques with SARS-CoV2, tested if the infection was similar to humans happening in the upper airways (which it was), and re-infected the animals after 28 days with a really high dose of virus (which is much higher than what comes around in our environment), with none of the macaques getting re-infected or showing pathological signs of the infection. See reference 1 for details.
This article has its limitations with small sample size and the general questions if the chosen animal model is really comparable with human. 

Additionally it looks very much like that patients who are recovering don't shed infectious virus anymore. The PCR test however does not discriminate between infectious virus and plain virus RNA, so it is most like much longer positive than people are infectious. They also show the rapid appearance of specific antibodies, which would at least temporarily protect against a re-infection. See reference 2 for a nice summary and reference 3 for the original article.

"One hypothesis for which we have some supporting evidence is that the new virus (SARS-CoV-2) ""enters human cells through an interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2"" see here. Although it is still unclear what genes to target in order to prevent the infection (entry or reproduction). 

Is there empirical evidence suggesting what genes can be modulated to fight the infection?
","This is an interesting question. A recent study published on bioRxiv by researchers from Xi'an, China (pre-print) argues that CD147 can also be an entry receptor for the virus. They showed virus entry can be blocked by an antibody to human CD147.

"I've always used Acyclovir to treat cold sores, why doesn't it work on other viruses? 

How do coronaviruses differ from herpesviruses?
","Aciclovir specifically targets HSV-family viruses.

It is metabolized by a viral-specific enzyme into an inhibitor of the specific DNA polymerase expressed by the virus:


  in infected cells, HSV or VZV coded thymidine kinase facilitates
  the conversion of aciclovir to aciclovir monophosphate, which is then converted to aciclovir triphosphate by cellular enzymes. Aciclovir triphosphate acts as an inhibitor of and substrate for the herpes specified DNA polymerase, preventing further viral DNA synthesis. 


https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&amp;id=CP-2009-PI-00595-3

Other viruses don't express these specific enzymes, and even if they have similar enzymes they may not interact the same way with the drug. Even within the herpesvirus family, the drug is not equally effective against every virus.

Coronaviruses are RNA viruses, so even though the drug is not effective for DNA viruses outside the herpesvirus family, coronaviruses are definitely not going to be affected because they don't even have a DNA polymerase to inhibit.

"I read an interesting article about two strains of the coronavirus:
https://www.newscientist.com/article/2236544-coronavirus-are-there-two-strains-and-is-one-more-deadly/

I would like to know how the scientists used to classify a coronavirus as l-strain and s-strain.
And more specifically I would like to have the genome(The DNA) for a l-strain and a s-strain.
","Article links to this publication which has all the information needed:
https://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036/5775463

It is mentioned in the paper that:


  Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between
  SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the
  difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between
  the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated.


Their results highlight evolutionary changes in the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). These developmental variations have a spike in changes to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs

How do they define S and L variations?

They did population genetics on 103 available SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
These two major types are well defined by two SNPs which show complete linkage across the viral strains.

It also important to mention that SARS-CoV-2 was found to have 96.2% similairty to a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13) but not very similar to SARS-CoV (79%) or MERS-CoV (50%).

How do we know that there's two type?

We know there's two types because from the 103 sequenced genomes two SNP locations show significant linkage. These are SNPs at location 8,782 (orf1ab: T8517C, synoniumous) and 28,144 (ORF8: C251T, S84L).

If you have a ""CT"" (as in base pairs) haplotype SARS-CoV-2 you've got the L-type (""L"" type because T28,144 is in the codon of Leucine). Otherwise, if you've got a ""TC"" haplotype you have the S-type (C28,144 is in the codon of Serine).

They found that S-type is the ancient (less aggressive version) by aligning it with other older viruses. In fact for each variant of the virus the ancestral state was inferred by alignments of SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512), RaTG13, and GD Pangolin-Cov.

So to be more precise on my answer for finding S and L types. You sequence the genome of an infected individual (you can find these online on NCBI) align it with the current reference sequence (MN908947, NC_045512), look at the SNPs and figure if they have a ""CT"" or ""TC"" haplotype to determine S or L type.

"Why are vaccines required for our body's immune system to destroy viruses that cause the likes of Covid-19 or Polio, while viruses that cause the common-cold are self-limiting (go away on their own)? What is so different about viruses that cause diseases requiring vaccines? 
","There is not really an inherent difference between these viruses.  Polio is a run of the mill enterovirus - some of its closest relatives are ""common colds"", while others are less pleasant - see https://www.slideshare.net/TarekMahbubKhan/enteroviruses-and-polio for some examples.  Note that some ""common cold"" viruses have uncommon but nonetheless devastating polio like effects; a leading culprit for acute flaccid myelitis (polio-like paralysis) was the common cold enterovirus D68 ( https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(18)30094-X/fulltext but I haven't checked for updates lately).  But for that virus, damaging replication in nerve tissue is at most a rare complication rather than a frequent one.

Coronavirus has long been known for several strains of ""common colds""; they were just not as frequently deadly.  Unfortunately, we did not see the ""cold and flu season"" as a demonstration of defenselessness against viral outbreaks, and did not use the opportunity to practice exterminating them.
"
"All news I can see scientist telling that the SARS-CoV-2 virus survive more in cold and dry weather. I can understand cold as hot weather will desiccate virus, but why dry  weather.

Would not dry weather dry droplets of saliva sooner also desiccate virus, would not humid weather support virus?
","So I found this information regarding humidity from an article by MIT on corona:

1) High humidity leads to condensation of sneezing cough saliva particles sooner, so it does not spread to farther distance

2) Low humidity leads to less condensation and higher range of movement of saliva particle, hence more spread area.

Apparently it has to do with physics and range of infection not on survivability.

"I have a question about the novel coronavirus and swine flu.


How do the death rates compare between the two diseases?
How do the transmissions and rate of transmission compare?
Was a vaccine developed quicker for swine flu?


I ask because I don't recall this level of global disruption during the swine flu outbreak.
","“Swine flu” is an obsolete name.  The official name for the virus that was briefly called “swine flu” is “H1N1pdm09”. 

H1N1pdm09 has a mortality rate of around 0.01-0.1%. That’s roughly 10- to 20-fold lower than COVID-19. Its R0 was estimated at between 1 and 2, which is roughly half the estimates for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19]. 

A vaccine for H1N1pdm09 was available in the fall of 2010.  It was possible to make it that quickly because it’s just another influenza strain, and the normal techniques for for vaccines against influenza strains worked fine. 

Most importantly, H1N1pdm09 never went away.  It is still one of the main influenza strains circulating today, and if you were vaccinated for influenza since 2010 you received a vaccine against it.

"To break the title down into parts: 


There exist serology tests that detect the amount of an antibody (Ab)
against a specific pathogen/antigen.
Every human produces their own Ab for a specific antigen by
(relatively) random combination of different gene segments in their B
cells, until one that recognizes the pathogen is found and produced
in massive amounts.
One portion of every Ab is constant, whereas the portion that
recognizes the antigen is variable. Even for antibodies (in different
humans) that recognize the same antigen, albeit to a lesser degree.


What exactly does an antibody titer/serology test detect in the blood so that it can accurately measure the amount of antibodies against a specific antigen? I am assuming they use antibodies against the antigen-binding/variable portion of an antibody. But if the variable region differs from person to person, how can a universal antibody (to be used in serology tests) against it be generated? 

Is the variable region not that variable, so that any lab-generated antibody against any functional antibody against a virus works well enough for an accurate measurement of antibodies against that virus? But even so the concept sounds hard to believe since even a single antigen can have multiple epitopes, and one person might have an Ab for epitope 1 of antigen X, while the other would have an Ab for epitope 2 of antigen X. And they would still be immune to the same virus, while a universal Ab titer test for the virus would be unable to detect antibodies from one of them.

Do they perhaps employ multiple lab-generated antibodies against most of the possible variations of human-generated antibodies in the tests?
","Specific antibodies are typically detected using ELISA.

The way you make a test for an antibody to a particular pathogen is not by using secondary antibodies to the specific part of the target antibody, but by using the antigen.

Different kits work differently, but the general idea is that you have antigen stuck to a surface, you put the sample on that surface. If there are antibodies to the antigen, they stick to it. Then you wash everything away and add a tagged antibody that binds to generic human antibodies.

"Can one be immune to the new coronavirus?

Another question is what is the exact definition of ""being immune"". Does it mean that even when the virus enters my system, it cannot multiply?
","It is hypothesized that exposure to and recovery from SARS-CoV-2 (as with other coronaviruses in humans) would generally result in short-term immunity to this strain, but we do not yet have data on this:


  However, according to Dr Stephen Gluckman, an infectious diseases physician at Penn Medicine and the medical director of Penn Global Medicine, who spoke to the outlet, it seems likely that having the disease once results in immunity in most individuals - as is seen with other coronaviruses. 
  
  “Coronaviruses aren’t new, they’ve been around for a long, long time and many species - not just humans - get them,” he explained. “So we know a fair amount about coronaviruses in general. For the most part, the feeling is once you’ve had a specific coronavirus, you are immune. We don’t have enough data to say that with this coronavirus, but it is likely.”
  
  This means that people who initially recovered are more likely to relapse rather than get reinfected with the virus. 
  
  According to one study, people with mild infections can test positive for the virus by throat swabs “for days and even weeks after their illness”.
  
  But, that doesn’t mean it isn’t possible to contract the disease again, especially in those who are immunocompromised. 
  
  “The immune response to Covid-19 is not yet understood,” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explains. “Patients with MERS-CoV infection are unlikely to be reinfected shortly after they recover, but it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients with Covid-19.”



Coronavirus: Can You Get Covid-19 Twice Or Does It Cause Immunity?


It is also hypothesized (in humans) that previous exposure to coronaviruses may enable immunity to certain other highly related strains:


  These data indicate that challenge immunity to coronaviruses is strong, but highly virus strain-specific.



Virus strain specificity of challenge immunity to coronavirus., Archives of Virology (1989)


But these are all examples of adaptive immunity - not innate.

"Many human coronaviruses have ancestral host origins in species of bat. However, all instances I am aware of identified other animals as intermediary vectors:

MERS-CoV: Human ← Dromedary Camel ← Bat
HCoV-229E: Human ← Alpaca ← Bat


Are there any known cases of direct bat to human transmission of coronavirus?



Source: Bats and Coronaviruses, Viruses (2019)

","It is possible, but unconfirmed, that the first incidents of SARS-CoV were directly infected by bats, and that palm civits were infected parallelly:


  The new study demonstrates that Chinese horseshoe bats harbor a pair of SARS like viruses that are very closely related to the strain that caused the 2003-2004 pandemic and that these strains have the capacity to directly infect human cells and civet cat cells as well as bat cells. These findings suggest that bats may have directly infected humans and that civet cats may have been incidentally infected.

"A search following a recent news item led me to a CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report for 23 March 2020 which says in part:


  SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified on a variety of
  surfaces in cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic
  infected passengers up to 17 days after cabins were vacated
  on the Diamond Princess but before disinfection procedures
  had been conducted (Takuya Yamagishi, National Institute of
  Infectious Diseases, personal communication, 2020). Although
  these data cannot be used to determine whether transmission
  occurred from contaminated surfaces, further study of fomite
  transmission of SARS-CoV-2 aboard cruise ships is warranted.


Identifying bits of RNA does not imply a surface is infectious and that's not what I am asking about here. 

This reminded me of answer(s) to Was 14,000+ year old DNA “laying around in cave dirt” protected from degradation, or is it just naturally this robust? which explain that small fragments of DNA can be quite stable in some environments; in some places on Earth the DNA in the soil can be ten thousand years old.

Question: Roughly speaking how stable are short sections of single-stranded RNA in exposed environments compared to double-stranded DNA?

The answer is likely to contain ""It depends on..."" as did the answer to the DNA stability question, I'm primarily interested in the differential stability between the two.
","The main difference in stability is due to the very high amounts of RNase in pretty much all fresh biological materials. Naked RNA is easily degraded by just touching it with skin. The first step in most RNA extractions is often to add an RNase inhibitor.

For example, from Wikipedia's Ribonuclease; RNase contamination during RNA  extraction:


  The extraction of RNA in molecular biology experiments is greatly complicated by the presence of ubiquitous and hardy ribonucleases that degrade RNA samples. Certain RNases can be extremely hardy and inactivating them is difficult compared to neutralizing DNases. In addition to the cellular RNases that are released, there are several RNases that are present in the environment. RNases have evolved to have many extracellular functions in various organisms.

"There has been some electron micrograph of SARS-COV-2 published; but are there any fluorescent/ confocal-fluorescent image of them? or is it possible to do them?  I know that viruses are usually much smaller than capacity of light microscope but I think by using any immunofluorescent probe or FISH technique it is possible to visualise the locations occurance of the virus in cell or tissue. At least one website says it is possible to visualise viral infections using fluorescence techniques. 

Now is there any such image for SARS-COV-2, and is it possible to take? 
","If you have an antibody against the viral proteins you can do an immuno staining followed by fluorescence imaging. For this type of technique you would need a very specific antibody. I am not aware that this exist at the moment and I don't think anyone had the time to do it for immunostaining purposes.

For FISH it would depend on the genomic nature of the virus (ssRNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, dsDNA), again you would need specific probes to capture it. Again specific is key.

"Multiple groups of scientists are trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine but they are not yet being fruitful. What challenges or difficulties are there in the process that slowing down and/or causing failure in development of vaccine?
","There are multiple challenges presented, and many of those are not limited to coronavirus vaccine.

As mentioned above, it just takes time. Before a vaccine can be used in patients, clinical trials must be performed to validate the safety and efficiency of the vaccine candidate. A Clinical trial includes three phases, which again, just takes time.

But to really answer your question, what are some challenges of developing a vaccine?

To begin with, from the perspective of lab research, we first need to develop a vaccine candidate. What protein on the virus should we take as an antigen? There are many many proteins on the virus, and for CoV, we know it is a protein called Spike protein. It is the neutralizing target on the virus. Which means, when an antibody bound to this site, it could prevent the virus from infecting the cells. Okay, then we have to know, do we need to do something to this protein to make a vaccine? For example, when we try to manufacture this protein into a vaccine, what if the protein is degraded? Or it somehow becomes a 'bad' protein that simply cannot stimulate immune responses in human? These are just some examples of roadblocks of developing vaccine.

Let's suppose we finally work those out. Then what's next? Each candidate vaccine needs to be tested in animals before going into human clinical trial. This step is time-consuming.

Now we are finally ready to start clinical trials. According to FDA, the vaccine for human trials (also for each drug) needs to be produced under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). It's basically a standard operating procedure to make sure that the vaccine candidate can be manufactured in a large-scale, quality-controlled manner. There are many many challenges, like how to purify the protein? How to scale-up production. This is partly of the reason why the first vaccine in trial in USA is an mRNA, and in China is a DNA, both of which does not require complicated protein purification.

As you can see, the list of challenges can go on and on. But there are scientists and doctors working diligently on it. Hopefully we'll get there.

"Consider the following scenario:


Person A has been infected with some virus (for example, SARS-CoV-2)
Person A has recovered


From this scenario, I assume Person A has managed to develop antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. If so:


For how long, after recovery, would Person A have antibodies for the virus running in their blood?
If Person A donates blood to Person B, would Person B have better responses against the virus, by using  the antibodies received along the blood from Person A? (assuming the donation is successful without issues)
Is there any paper / study building upon this idea for combating SARS-CoV-2?


Notes:


I am not expecting exact quantitative answers to these questions. I just want basic understanding for reasons this could or could not work.

","Question 1


  [...] antibodies [...] can last anywhere between a few weeks to a few months. The antibodies themselves though (which are proteins) definitely don't last forever (like all proteins). Eventually certain suppressor cells kill off plasma cells after the response has taken its course, and all that remains are a few memory cells, which are reactivated again should the pathogen invade the body in the future.

"Coronavirus, HIV, 1918 Flu, etc. They all come from animals. Do any infectious diseases (in humans) come from plants? More specifically, are there viruses that infect plants that can mutate to infect humans?
","Question


  “Are there viruses that infect plants that can mutate to infect
  humans?”


Answer

None appear to have been reported so far. It is difficult to provide supporting evidence for an assertion that they do not exist, but a recent review on the relationship between plant and animal viromes does not include any examples, and our general understanding of the mechanisms by which viruses infect organisms and cells suggest that this is unlikely. There are, however, examples of plant viruses replicating in the insect vectors that transmit them.

Evidence

In 2011 Dolja and Koonin of the NIH published a review in Current Opinion in Virology 1 322-331 entitled Common origins and host-dependent diversity of plant and animal viromes. In this they considered: 


  “…three distinct scenarios for the origin of related viruses of plants
  and animals: i) evolution from a common ancestral virus predating the
  divergence of plants and animals; ii) horizontal transfer of viruses,
  for example, through insect vectors; iii) parallel origin from related
  genetic elements.”


The very fact that there was a need to argue for a relationship indicates the assumed distinction between animal and plant viruses, and indeed they write:


  “…plants are not known to support reproduction of dsDNA viruses and
  retroviruses.”


The only reference in the whole article to an actual biological relationship between animal and plant viruses is the following:


  “Strikingly, viruses of the order Mononegavirales and the family
  Bunyaviridae… can also reproduce in their arthropod vectors.”


The paper referenced in support of this statement is by Hogenhout et al. and was published in the Annual Review of Phytophathology (2008) 46 327–359, and is entitled Insect Vector Interactions with Persistently Transmitted Viruses. From this it emerges that there is a class of plant viruses called persistent propogative viruses which replicate in the circulation of their insect vectors, in contrast to most types of circulative viruses. The insects involved include the leafhopper (illustrated below in Fig 1 from that review) and the thrip.



Schematic representation of persistent virus transmission by a leafhopper. Viruses that are transmitted in a circulative persistent manner do not replicate in the insect and usually enter the salivary glands from the hemolymph. In plants, replication of circulative viruses is frequently restricted to the phloem tissues. In contrast, most propagative viruses replicate in several plant tissues and in different organs of the insect vectors ( yellow arrows) and may enter the salivary glands either from the hemolymph or from other connecting tissues, e.g., the nervous system or trachea. 

It is not clear to me whether the virus is in any way detremental to the insect vector — certainly it is not the primary target of the virus, and replication can be regarded as allowing it to survive longer before the insect transmits it to the plant.

Today insects, tomorrow people?

The very fact that persistent propogative insect viruses can replicate in their animal vectors raises the question whether the insects could somehow transmit them to human beings. In an answer to a different question on whether insect pathogens can infect humans I have argued that the absence of examples in situations where people come into close contact with insects and the  difference in anatomy and molecular structure of cell membranes makes this unlikely. In the present case we are not even talking about an insect pathogen, but a plant pathogen.

"I bought 99% isopropyl alcohol and made 70% alcohol + 30% water in small spraying bottles as a disinfectant. 

I also read that this solution is safe and recommended by Apple for cleaning iPhones.

My worry comes from reading on the 99% bottle how extremely dangerous it is to humans. Basically touching, inhaling and of course consuming it is very toxic.

On the other hand 70% alcohol solutions are found in most hand and surface sanitizers which are usable against COVID-19.

So my question is: how much should I be afraid when cleaning surfaces with my small 70% spray bottle? Since alcohol evaporates, I'd be naturally inhaling it, I mean where else could it go in the air? I'm also just spraying it on a wipe to clean my mobile, not using a rubber glove for that.

What are the health concerns when using such solution?
","If you're interested in the biological or health effects of various chemicals, try to look up the Safety Data Sheet, or ""SDS"" or ""MSDS"", for that chemical compound.

Going to your favorite search engine and plugging in your chemical of interest to the search term ""SDS"" or ""MSDS"" will almost always get you to some kind of answer — either what you're looking for has a safety data sheet or it doesn't!

In the case of 70% isopropyl alcohol, there are SDSs/MSDSs out there that will tell you what potential health effects are. Here's one example for 70% isopropyl alcohol:


  Potential Health Effects
  
  Eye: Produces irritation, characterized by a burning sensation, redness, tearing, inflammation, and possible corneal injury. May cause transient corneal injury. In the eyes of a rabbit, 0.1 ml of 70% isopropyl alcohol caused conjunctivitis, iritis, and corneal opacity.
  
  Skin: May cause irritation with pain and stinging, especially if the skin is abraded. Isopropanol has a low potential to cause allergic skin reactions; however, rare cases of allergic contact dermatitis have been reported. May be absorbed through intact skin. Dermal absorption has been considered toxicologically insignificant. The cases of deep coma associated with skin contact are thought to be a consequence of gross isopropanol vapor inhalation in rooms with inadequate ventilation, rather than being attributable to percutaneous absorption of isopropanol per se.
  
  Ingestion: Causes gastrointestinal irritation with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. May cause kidney damage. May cause central nervous system depression, characterized by excitement, followed by headache, dizziness, drowsiness, and nausea. Advanced stages may cause collapse, unconsciousness, coma and possible death due to respiratory failure. Aspiration of material into the lungs may cause chemical pneumonitis, which may be fatal. The probable oral lethal dose in humans is 240 ml (2696 mg/kg), but ingestion of only 20 ml (224 mg/kg) has caused poisoning.
  
  Inhalation: Inhalation of high concentrations may cause central nervous system effects characterized by nausea, headache, dizziness, unconsciousness and coma. May cause narcotic effects in high concentration. Causes upper respiratory tract irritation. Inhalation of vapors may cause drowsiness and dizziness.
  
  Chronic: Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause defatting and dermatitis.


Safety data sheets sound terrible! But in reality, people use rubbing alcohol with common sense, without putting into their eyes, without drinking it, etc. 

Mainly the point of this answer is to help you find the answer for yourself, if you want to find out about this or other chemicals you might be worried about.

"I am curious if there has ever been a (modern) clinical study where a healthy volunteer was purposefully infected with a pathogen in order to test the effectiveness of a therapeutic or preventative measure (like a vaccine)?

If not, would the FDA allow for ethical exceptions in cases where there is an extreme case of urgency (like in a pandemic)?

Obviously these would be willing volunteers who signed waivers, etc. So Nazi experimentation, the Tuskegee trial, and other studies without total consent from the participants wouldn't qualify here.

Edit: Self-experimentation wouldn't qualify here either because the bioethics of self-experimentation are different than testing on others. 
","One can't easily separate ethics from how biology is done, as much as some people have tried. (Though I suppose some have made bioethics into a separate and successful media career, so it can be done in that way.)

In addition to the comment-answer about the Tuskegee Study, Nazi doctors in Germany performed experiments without consent, which included infecting concentration camp prisoners with the bacteria that cause tuberculosis.

Your question is about volunteerism, however, and the victims of the United States and Nazi Germany did not give full — or any — consent to experimentation.

In this week's issue of Nature, there is a news article which interviews bioethicist Nir Eyal about a recent preprint, of which he is a primary author. 

In this interview and in the preprint, your very question about coronavirus vaccine research, specifically, is discussed, as it concerns the matters of consent, ethics, and safety of doing accelerated biological research about this virus in a time of emergency.

In answer to your first question about modern clinical studies, Dr. Eyal notes:


  Are there any precedents for infecting healthy people with a pathogen?
  
  We do human-challenge studies for less deadly diseases quite frequently. For example, for influenza, typhoid, cholera and malaria. There are some historical precedents for exposure to very deadly viruses. The thing that demarcates the design that we propose from some of these historical instances is that we feel there is a way to make these trials surprisingly safe.


As an example, there was a challenge trial for malaria performed in 2012. Healthy individuals were bitten by mosquitoes carrying the malaria parasite and then treated with antimalarial therapies. 

Clinical trials are done under the aegis of government agencies with review and approval processes, some of which are described on the FDA web site. IRBs or Institutional Review Boards provide oversight:


  Under FDA regulations, an IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects.

"We often get sore throats once or twice a year, and it clears in a few days sometimes without any antibiotics. I was wondering why doesn't our body become immune after clearing a sore throat?
"," Short Answer 


It should be noted that there are many non-pathogenic causes of sore throat, and I would suspect that you are not always distinguishing these causes from actual illness.


In most cases, it would not be possible to build a response (immunological or otherwise) to avoid reacting to these stressors. 

Bacteria and viruses mutate frequently in ways that make your immune system unable to properly recognize them to ward off initial infection.


Your immune system recognizes specific pathogens based on structural characteristics. If those characteristics change when pathogens mutate (which happens fairly frequently), your immune system will not recognize it as readily (or initially at all).  



 Long Answer 

Sore throat is most commonly attributed to pharyngitis, or the inflammation of the back of the throat called the pharynx.

Causes

Sore throats can be caused by many things. (e.g., see here, summarized below):

First off, a sore throat can be the result of many things unrelated to illness: 


Allergies
Dryness
Irritants
Excessive talking,singing,shouting,etc.
Muscle Strain
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)


As a result, at least 30+% (higher in adults) of reported sore throat cases (and supposedly many more unreported cases) are not due to any type of illness. 

Further, a number of pathogens can cause a sore throat:


Viruses


Rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, adenoviruses, Epstein–Barr, etc.
(see here for one estimate of relative etiologies). 

Bacteria


A number of bacterial infections can cause a sore throat. The most common is Streptococcus pyogenes (aka ""Strep A""). 



It turns out that pathogen-caused pharyngitis is fairly common. Supposedly 10% of adults with sore throats have strep, and around 70% of children pharyngitis cases seen by doctors are either virally or bacterially caused.  


However, it should be noted that only 20-30% of children and just 5-10% of adults have bacteria to blame for their sore throat, with viral infections being much more common. (source: IDSA).


Sore Throat Frequency

It turns out that sore throats are fairly common; Jones (2004) determined that about 7.5% of people have a sore throat in any three-month period. Further, on average, adults get a sore throat two to three times a year and children about five times a year (Tamparo 2011 and Rutter &amp; Newby 2015), so your personal experience is fairly average.

Because viral causes and non-pathogenic causes make up an overwhelming percentage of overall sore throat cases, it shouldn't be surprising that most sore throats clear up without the use of any antibiotics. 

As for those that are caused by pathogens:

Why no Immunity?

Bacteria and viruses both mutate fairly quickly (see Antigenic Variation, Antigenic Drift and Antigenic Shift), so it shouldn't be surprising that you're capable of having an immune response to pathogens throughout life. 


If we consider just strep alone, it mutates/reemerges with improved fitness frequently (e.g., see Bao et al 2016 and their citations)
And see Sanjuán et al. (2010) for a reviewof viral mutation rates. 


So not only are there a number of pathogens that can cause sore throat, but each of these pathogens can mutate. That leaves you with a fairly sizable number of potential invaders that can illicit a sore throat. 

Let's See How Your Immune System Responds:

Your immune system contains cells that can be split into two broad groups: cells that belong to the adaptive immune system, and cells which belong to the innate immune system. [See here for a simple explanation].


Innate Immune system: consists of cells responsible for initial detection of pathogens, recruitment of other immune cells, activation of the complement system, engulfment and (more immediate) destruction of pathogens. 
Adaptive immune system: consists of cells which coordinate to develop a memory of the infections they've seen previously in order to mount a faster, more pronounced immune response to repeat pathogens.


Depending on the kind of foreign invasion, two different immune responses can occur in either of these 2 broader ""systems"": either a humoral response involving antibodies or a cell-mediated repsponse.



A general feature of the immune system is that these mechanisms rely on detecting structural features of the pathogen or toxin that mark it as distinct from host cells (see Chaplin 2010 for a review). The mechanisms permitting recognition of pathogenic/toxic foreign structures can be broken down into two general categories: 


hard-wired responses encoded by genes that recognize molecular patterns shared both by many microbes and toxins that are not present in the mammalian host. This is the innate system described above.
responses that are encoded by gene elements that somatically rearrange to assemble antigen-binding molecules with extreme specificity for individual unique foreign structures. This is the adaptive system described above.


Antibodies recognizes a unique/specific molecule of the harmful agent, called an antigen, and binds to it to tag it for immune attack.  





  Because the adaptive system is composed of small numbers of cells with specificity for any individual pathogen the responding cells must proliferate after encountering the antigen in order to attain sufficient numbers to mount an effective response against the microbe or the toxin. [Source: Chaplin 2010].



This means that you can still experience some mild symptoms due to the invading pathogen. 



The important take-away from all this, though, is that your immune response relies on structural ""markers"" on pathogens in order to recognize them. This is true for both innate and adaptive immune responses. If the physical/structural properties of a pathogen change (due to antigenic processes and mutations as mentioned above) your immune system will be slower (and possibly ineffective) in responding to an attack.  


The result, then, could be another one of those sore throats...

"I heard that the scientist in Australia found a way to segregate the 2019 NovCoronovirus from the blood. Does this mean they are one step closer to the cure? Why is virus segregation crucial in finding a cure for a viral infection? 
","2019-NCoV was first cultured by a Chinese group, as published here on January 24. China has not shared samples, but did share sequencing data in the linked paper and via GISAID. The Australian group at the Doherty Institute hasn't published yet, but did put out a press release today (January 29), and appears to be the first group outside of China to have cultured 2019-NCoV. 

Viral isolation, and in particular, culture, is an important, and often difficult step in characterizing a novel virus. Once characterized, viral culture serves as a gold standard for diagnosis. Generally speaking, the ability to grow virus in cell culture allows for a broad range of pre-clinical studies that can lead to clinical advances including prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Consider how difficult it may be to study a pathogen if you are not able to manipulate it in a living culture. You can read about this in Murray Medical Microbiology, Ch 50. This article, which does not require a subscription, may also be of interest. The article describes a variety of historical and modern methods, but also includes some discussion about the use of viral culture.

"In search for any possible new treatments for COVID-19, I am of the understanding that the SARS-nCoV-2 virus may suffer deterioration at high temperatures and high humidity, to perhaps weaken it sufficiently for your immune system to be able to handle it.

If you are referring to the linked question, that is for virus in air on a dry surface.  It is a test of how long the virus can survive outside of a host before it is desiccated and destroyed by the environment.  It is not relevant to viral particles inside of an organism.

There is little evidence that elevated body temperature has much effect on duration of infection with most common viral diseases. This is why antipyretic drugs are commonly recommended for people with viral infections.

"It's been reported recently that people are panic-buying stuff as the coronavirus epidemic worsens. I've even noticed that the local grocery store is low on hand sanitizer, paper towels, and bottled water.

I did some reading and traced links back to the DHS's ready.gov website, and it recommended preparing a 2-week supply of food, water, medicine, and hygiene products for ISOLATION, though I expect if you're sick you're supposed to plan a trip to the hospital. Most of that makes sense to me. The exception is the supply of water. We have public water systems that send drinkable water to us, so why do we need to prepare a stash?

I tried finding an answer online, but I couldn't. The only guess I have is that coronavirus can contaminate the public water system, and it's not guaranteed water treatment will work. Who here has the know-how on waterborne viruses and water treatment to address this speculation?
","Viruses can survive a few days in water, i.e. SARS can survive 22 days in lab grade reagent water and 7 days in pasteurized sewage. That is the time the virus takes to be at 99% of it's original concentration. (from ""survival of surrogate coronavirus in water"").

Viruses can also spread via swimming pools, i.e. hepatitus A and norovirus have been associated with swimming pools. (from ""a review of waterborne viral deseases associated with swimming pools"").

Boiling water will kill viruses. Children have very little reaction to the virus when they carry it, so it's likely that they act as a transmitter more than water does. I'm not worried about it at all by the way, just do what the doctors advise.

"I'm trying to observe the behavior of simple viruses in different environments. I'm just looking for simple viruses like the common cold and the flu virus nothing major. Is there a way to obtain them? 
","First of all, cold and flu viruses are not 'simple viruses', and they are not harmless. They kill tens to hundreds of thousands of people every year. 

Secondly, this would depend highly on the risk group that the virus falls in. The NIH sets strict guidelines on who can handle infectious agents. Unfortunately, I can almost guarantee you that no one is going to give you even risk group 1 plant viruses, and they are certainly are not going to give you cold or flu viruses. Risk groups range from 1 to 4. To handle risk group 2 viruses, for example, you are expected to do so in a BSL-2 or higher laboratory, and anyone maintaining stocks of virus is going to do a hefty check of you and your 'facilities' before shipping you anything.

Furthermore, even if you did obtain the virus, you would need to store it or maintain stocks of the virus in tissue culture. Its not like you can just get an eppendorf tube of virus in saline and expect it to survive in your refrigerator at home, and its not like companies are shipping virus willy-nilly to anyone.

That being said, and at the expense of sounding self-righteous, there is really no reason for you to obtain virus particles. You should start by getting a book on virology and reading it. There is plenty of learning material both visual and written out there, and all I will say is if you don't already know how to culture virus or where to obtain it, you shouldnt be doing so, and no one is going to give it to you.

"Because ACE2 is used by SARS-NCoV-2 to enter the cell, I am curious what factors determine its expression.  Interestingly, myocardial infarction increases ACE2 expression in the heart in an animal model ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15671045 ).  The paper found no significant effect from ramipril, an ACE inhibitor, but I don't think I can assume ARBs would work the same way.  (I am suspicious they might increase it based on the increase in the product Ang(1-7) level - https://www.nature.com/articles/hr200974 )  Note that soluble sACE2 can bind cells that did not produce it, by an RGD independent association with integrin beta 1.

Anything that influences the amount of ACE2 on cell surfaces is a useful answer.
","I should follow up with some things I've found.  As a starting point, the normal expression pattern is available at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/path.1570 - note the staining of simple squamous epithelium in the alveoli and the endothelia of blood vessels.  Another paper details a sharp decrease in expression with age in rats, but I don't know if that extends to humans.

For regulation of expression, I was surprised to see that Google Scholar actually provides a very good assortment of search results, easier to work with than PubMed, which were topped by the MI regulation I described in the question.  Additionally https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/path.1670 (yes, that IS a different link) describes ACE2 expression in renal disease but not in normal kidney.  ACE2 expression correlated with proteinuria, but negatively with GFR. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-008-0988-x  There are discordant notes in some other situations: for example, subtotal nephrectomy decreased ACE2 expression in a way that was partially prevented by ramipril. https://portlandpress.com/clinsci/article/118/4/269/68827/Reduction-in-renal-ACE2-expression-in-subtotal

The mRNA and protein are both described in atherosclerotic lesions: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/path.2357 

In the lungs https://jvi.asm.org/content/79/23/14614.short describes a positive correlation with differentiation state in airway epithelium.  The regulation by HIF-1 alpha in hypoxia seems of special importance: https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajplung.90415.2008 but it is complicated (both positive and negative).

ACE2 is also expressed at high levels in placenta during pregnancy - at least in rats. https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.90592.2008

Last but not least, pharmacologic data is reviewed at https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11906-008-0076-0.pdf which describes up-regulation of ACE2 by angiotensin II receptor blockers, ACE blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers.  This includes the common drugs lisinopril and losartan.  (see also https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcmm.12573 ) Unfortunately the paper did not report substances inhibiting ACE2 expression.  But https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00239.2008 reported that high glucose (!) or PKC inhibitors could reduce ACE2 expression.  (but the high glucose was causing kidney injury, which as described above could mean more ACE2...)  The anti-diabetes drug liraglutide increased ACE2: https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/156/10/3559/2422879  To top it all off?  SARS itself decreases ACE2 expression, and this might be part of the process injuring the lungs: https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1267

This is by no means a complete survey, and there is much I don't understand.  The relationship between ACE2 biology and the emerging COVID-19 risk groups seems apparent - as is the urgent need for research to determine which manipulations to ACE2 expression have positive versus negative effects on the prognosis of that disease.

Update: a NEJM podcast today described this biology as 'complicated' link.  It is clearly of interest, but still under investigation.  For example, losartan is presently the subject of two clinical studies news, presumably these ClinicalTrials

"I can see the chain of spreading disease: Humans usually get rabies from domestic animals, those usually get it from wild animals, wild animals in their turn get from the other wild animals and here I'm stuck. Well, so where do wild animals get it from initially?

I know that rabies is a virus and it needs warm-blooded animals to live out. Also according to Wikipedia once an animal is effected it lasts, let's say, no longer than for 2 weeks. 

In other words, does it mean that there is a constant population of rabid animals that exists in order to pass this virus from one animal to another every 2 week on the average?
","Such viruses have a natural host, which might get sick, but is usually not killed by the virus. From there, the virus can get zoonotic (jump over species barriers) and infect other animals when it comes to contact. For Rabies the reservoir hosts are different, for the US these are bats, skunks and racoons. For more details, have a look on this PDF.

Another example for this is the SARS virus (a corona virus) which most likely lives in bats naturally and has jumped from there onto birds and from there infected humans.

"There are various statistics estimating mortality of COVID-19 infections, based on how many diagnosed people have died. These numbers are used by various media to extrapolate how many people will die if the disease spreads uncontrollably.

  The asymptomatic ratio is thus estimated at 41.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 16.7%, 66.7%) among evacuees. Because fourteen days have elapsed since their departure from Wuhan—longer than the 95th percentile estimate of the COVID-19 incubation period (Li et al., 2020; Linton et al., 2020)—there is very little probability that the five virus-positive asymptomatic individuals will develop symptoms. Should one of the five becomes symptomatic in the future, the overall asymptomatic ratio would decrease to 33.3% (95% CI: 8.3%, 58.3%).

"I was reading about a viral list of dubious coronavirus tips on The Verge and reached this tip:


  “Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other
  liquids will wash them down through your throat and into the stomach.
  Once there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus,” one tip reads.
  Loren Rauch, an emergency room doctor in Los Angeles who has a
  master’s degree in epidemiology, told Mother Jones this advice was
  “totally bogus.”


I asked a friend, who has a PhD. in cell biology, about this and she said that it's true that a virus would be killed by the stomach acid (i.e. due to high acidity, or low pH value, of stomach acid which could easily break the structure of the virus); however, she added that it's NOT true to think that drinking water would wash the virus from your respiratory system (i.e. trachea or lungs) into your stomach, so drinking water regularly does not necessarily help if it's in your respiratory system.

I was a bit confused since the doctor referenced in the article considered the whole advice as totally false; on the other hand, my friend thinks at least part of the advice, i.e. the virus being killed by stomach acid, is true.

Now, my question is not limited to coronavirus and I am not seeking medical advice or treatment here. I just want to  know if my friend is scientifically correct, i.e. whether stomach acid is able to destroy the biological structure of a virus (any virus, and not necessarily coronavirus)? And if so, how does this work biologically?

I was waiting with bated breath for the CDC update on cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. by date of onset.  To my eyes this looks like absolutely wonderful news - that it means that the exponential growth of the virus has been ""flattened"" - but I'm still afraid I may be misinterpreting what I see.  It bothers me that the headline for the graph hasn't changed.  But it APPEARS that the number of new cases stopped increasing after 3/3.  Am I missing something?

Top: before noon on 3/16, bottom: after noon on 3/16.  Data from https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html

Note: In today's update (the first in three days) the CDC page shows the number of cases with onset on 3/4 to be 159, and 3/9 is 307.  This doubled in five days rather than every two or three as other numbers would suggest, but given the dramatic changes in this curve, and their overall direction, I think the top answer below has been vindicated.
","The information you show is meaningless unless it is also accompanied by the number of tests performed. If the CDC tested 2 people and got two positive results, that doesn't tell us anything at all about the actual rate of infection. And, indeed, the CDC has been testing a shockingly low number of cases:




  ‡ Data during this period are incomplete because of the lag in time between when specimens are accessioned, testing is performed, and results are reported.


(image source)

The last day they give data for, 2020-03-15, includes 0 samples from the CDC and 4 samples from other public health labs. Since only 4 samples are represented in the chart, of course we see a drop in cases, but that's because they are based on only 4 tests. As more tests for those dates and subsequent dates are reported, the numbers will change.

Date Collected  CDC Labs    US Public Health Labs

3/15            0‡          4‡


As you can see in the table above (from the same source as the graph), the past few days have seen almost no tests are being included in this analysis either from the CDC or elsewhere, so any drop in cases is completely meaningless.

"When the Spanish influenza hit in 1918, it struck in two waves. The first wave was typical for a flu virus, targetting mainly elderly people, but the second wave was far deadlier and killed far more young people. How likely is it for something similar to happen with the current coronavirus? Also, wikipedia states that people who contracted the virus during the first wave were immune to it in the second wave. I thought when a virus mutates it usually avoids detection, hence why we need to usually get an up to date flu vaccine annually. Why was this not the case for the spanish influenza?
","This is a great biological question! It asks a lot about how empirical science is done in the field of modern biology! I'm glad we encourage such questions from curious people who want to learn more.

Mutations are mostly deleterious to begin with. This means that mutant copies of virus only very rarely survive and proliferate. A virus that is deadlier will already be less likely to reproduce, having killed more hosts.

The current estimated mutation rate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is 24 bases per year. Of those mutations, those to be most concerned about are those which would mutate the proteins specific to this virus. Vaccine development will aim to train the immune system to target those proteins, particularly the S or spike protein.

Mutations to those proteins can make potential vaccines less effective. This is why influenza (""flu"") vaccines, which are produced ahead of the flu season, may not always line up against the more prevalent strains which result.

A recent comment was published in Nature, authored by life scientists and epidemiologists, which goes into your question in more detail, as regards to the novel coronavirus:


  In this case and that of SARS-CoV-2, mutations consume the narrative, even though individual mutations seldom become fixed during outbreaks nor modulate complex virological traits. Rather, mutation is a humdrum aspect of life for an RNA virus. Because these viruses employ an intrinsically error-prone RNA polymerase for replication, their genomes will accumulate mutations during every copying cycle. Moreover, these cycles can occur on the order of hours, ensuring that a diverse virus population will be generated within a single infected host. While this amazing capacity to mutate fuels the engine of evolutionary change, most mutations adversely impact some aspect of virus function and are removed by natural selection. (emphasis added)


Further, and more to the original point of your question:


  These warnings will probably not halt the question as to whether mutations will arise in SARS-CoV-2, enabling it to spread more efficiently between humans or generate a higher case fatality rate. In response, we can look to the 2002–2003 SARS-CoV epidemic. Large deletions in the open reading frame 8 (ORF8) region and mutations in the spike (S) protein were discovered during the early stages of the outbreak and eventually dominated the epidemic, suggesting that these were adaptations to humans12,13. Based on this observation, some hypothesized that virus genetic changes in part drove the SARS epidemic, but this claim is unsubstantiated14. So, could SARS-CoV-2 adapt in the same way? Yes. Will adaptation precipitate more deaths? Unlikely. (emph. added)

"The protease inhibitor lopinavir, originally developed as a cure against AIDS and HIV, has been shown efficient against SARS Coronavirus SARS-CoV. 


  Dayer M R, Taleb-Gassabi S, Dayer M S. Lopinavir; A Potent Drug against Coronavirus Infection: Insight from Molecular Docking Study, Arch Clin Infect Dis. 2017 ; 12(4):e13823. doi: 10.5812/archcid.13823.


Why is Lopinavir not efficient against SARS-CoV-2? Is there a difference in the gene encoding for the protease?
","Is there a difference in the gene encoding for the protease?

This paper by Wu et al. annotates the SARS-CoV-2 genome and compares its divergence from other coronaviruses, which may help answer your second question.

This annotation includes 16 genes for non-structural protein (""nsp""). Supplemental materials for this paper indicate that all but two of these proteins (nsp7 and nsp13) have amino acid substitutions between SARS-CoV-2 (""2019-nCoV"" in the paper) and SARS-CoV. 

The gene nsp5 encodes 3CLpro (chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease), so there are differences there. 

Literature suggests nsp5 and other non-structural proteins are potential targets for a number of antiviral therapies.

Another paper suggests further that lopinavir targets nsp3 products, among other proteins, in use against SARS-CoV:


  Lopinavir’s possible target is Nsp3b, Nsp3c, helicase, NRBD or E-channel with the mfScores of –158.050, –189.140, –114.018, –171.127, and –221.785, respectively.


The nsp3 gene contains a papain-like protease 2 (PL2pro) domain. Supplemental materials from the first linked paper suggest nsp3 has a different amino acid sequence between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. 

It might be worth digging into the Wu et al. paper and the raw annotation data to look at what those a.a. substitutions are, to see if that might help in determining why lopinavir is not as efficient at inactivating PL2pro and reducing levels of the novel coronavirus.

It may also be worth considering the target itself. Going back to the Nature Biotechnology article:


  But Erik De Clercq, of the Rega Institute for Medical Research in Leuven, Belgium, says that in searching for or designing effective drugs against COVID-19: “We should stay away from antivirals known to be acting at targets not playing a role in the replication of coronaviruses.” Such drugs include penciclovir, which is targeted at the herpesvirus DNA polymerase, and lopinavir/ritonavir, which are targeted at the HIV protease. Instead, he would favor targeting a virus-specific protein such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, noting that coronaviruses do not contain or use a reverse transcriptase.

"Several articles describe the unique ways Covid-19 patients are being buried.

For example, in this Reuters article about Israel:


  These included decontaminating and hermetically wrapping bodies in
  double layers of polyethylene. For Jewish dead, ritual washing of the
  body would be conducted in one of four special stations in the
  country, the document showed.


And this LA Times article about Iran:


  Nor are they wrapped in traditional white cloth. They are covered in
  hospital plastic, marking them as victims — both young and old — of
  the coronavirus.


People die from viruses all the time but I've never heard of victims being buried in this way. What is unique about Covid-19 ?
","The WHO guidelines for VHF victims (Ebola etc.) do say that they should be buried in body bags, and if those are not available, in plastic sheeting.


  If body bags are not available, wrap the body in two
  thickness of cotton cloth and soak with 1:10 bleach
  solution. Then wrap the body in plastic sheeting. Seal the
  wrapping with plastic tape. Spray the body bag as in
  Step 3. Place the body in a coffin if one is available.


Obviously some are treating covid-19 victims with the same amount of caution. I can't tell you at the moment if this is justified or not.
"
"Governments are imposing confinement measures on their populations, trusting that if there is no more transmission the virus will die out.
But since this coronavirus appeared a first time, what could prevent it from reappearing any number of times ?
","Frame challenge answer: you are jumping to the conclusion that they really hope the virus will ""die out"". But it's more likely they adopted those measures to slow its progression to a manageable degree. See e.g. this conceptual image from ECDC



Even if there are new outbreaks of COVID-19 in the future, when they happen is not irrelevant, as we could be much better prepared given the current/ongoing research on both (antiviral) treatments and possibly a vaccine as well.

Regarding the ""meat"" of the question, it's a matter of probabilities, not certainties. It was and is generally assumed that other [bat etc.] coronaviruses will jump hosts to humans in the future. 

Besides SARS, another (much) lesser known cross-species jump actually occurred in China in 2016 with SADS-CoV, which killed thousands of pig[let]s, but was not infectious to humans. Annoyingly enough for the Chinese pig farmers, SADS-CoV re-emerged in early 2019 despite the fact that there were no cases reported between May 2017 and January 2019.

"I assumed a virus to be something with a very specific geometry,
similar to a crystal, but more complex.

In an answer to 
What is the size (diameter) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus? some SARS-CoV-2 virus particles are shown.

It looks like they do not have the same geometry.

They may be soft and influenced by external forces, but they could also be of different, but similar shape. Also, they could simply be defective in some way.

I assume a structure of the size of a virus is not rigid. Assuming no external forces, would multiple exemplars  of the same kind of virus have the same shape?
Can a virus have a different molecular arrangement, but be equivalent for biological purposes?
","Some parts of viruses are consistently shaped, in particular anything that is made of multiple copies of a protein sticking together. There are methods to determine the structures of these regular components to high precision, like single particle analysis (eg. zika) and X-ray crystallography (bacteriophage HK97). Other parts of the virus are less consistent, either because they are flexible or because they are produced slightly differently each time. The nucleic acid core is often arranged semi-randomly, and the lipid envelope of many viruses can vary greatly, dependent on the process by which parts of the host cell's membrane is pinched off to create new viral particles. Here's an example of pretty extreme variability of influenza particles, based on what cell type they have infected. Virus particles with different shapes can be just as infectious, but if they are too large the number of new viruses produced by an infected cell may be too low.
"
"How many SARS-CoV-2 viruses are in circulation at the moment? And what is their total mass?

To clarify: if there are 10 000 viruses on average in an infected human and 100 000 humans are infected the answer would be (if all viruses are in humans, which probably isn't true) 10^4 x 10^5 = 10^9 viruses.

Of course I am only looking for a rough estimate, a number that, when multiplied with 10 or 0,1 (so two magnitudes) or so, is correct.
","Based on all species of viruses, Everyday you breathe in 100 million viruses. There can be 1mn+ viruses per ml of blood of patients. Covid-19 diameter = 125 nm.

Perhaps it's wrong, the maths would go something like this: 

1mn * 1000ml * 5liters * 400k patients = 2^12 - 2^13 sars2 viruses.

total volume of viruses =  2^13 viruses / 1^15 viruses per cm3 = 0.02 cm3

(10^7 nanometers per centimeter, 125nm diameter, gives, about 10^(5*3) viruses per cm3.)

Weight of all the Covid Sars 2 in the human population = a raindrop or a teaspoon of hydrocarbons/mayonnaise, probably less than a teacup.

Perhaps i am wrong, it's reasonable to think that the people with major symptoms contain about 1 ml of virus. 20k x 1ml = 20cm3

"If person A is infected (COVID-19) and person B is not, could the following work as a vaccination?  Person A exhales (coughs?) into a a transparent bag.  The bag is radiated for a long time with a strong ultraviolet (UV) light as is found in some residential well-water systems.  Person B inhales the contents of the bag.

I am curious mostly about how virus particles are damaged at the molecular level by UV light and how this relates to how vaccines are manufactured today.
","Short answer: probably not. 

Long answer: for your body to build immunity against something, it needs to identify it as something harmful to you. Otherwise, how would it know if this is just some random particle in your environment that it should ignore? There are molecular clues that your body uses to recognize better whether something is likely a pathogen (that means it should try to build immunity against) and those are some of the additives (known as adjuvants) present in man-made vaccines. 

Also, the route of administration is also important. Things that you eat or breath in are triaged by the waldeyer ring because maybe you just ate something that is alive, but not exactly a pathogen. Dysfunctions in this process (thinking a normal protein is part of a dangerous pathogen) is believed to be one of the possible causes of allergies. Injecting it into your blood-stream often makes it more effective (but there are exceptions: polio vaccine however can be orally administered). 

A nice read about this topic is this: The dichotomy of pathogens and allergens in vaccination approaches.

This is perhaps a must read on this topic: What to expect of a good vaccine and how to achieve it.

I'm not really sure what else to tell you. The process you described is a part of the manufacturing of some vaccines, so you are on the right track. But vaccines are hard to make, you can't do it for every disease and involves a lot of experimenting.
"
"Are we aware of a ""bug"" (virus, bacterium, prion, ...) that has completely exterminated an entire species? Either through direct observation or maybe some form of archeological evidence? If not, are there realistic scenarios where this could happen?

I am primarily interested in cases where the disease was the driving factor of extinction of an otherwise well established and healthy population, but examples of species that were in bad shape to begin with are welcome as well.

My understanding is that this is unlikely, since very deadly infections tend to burn out or evolve towards being less deadly. Killing your host is not conducive to your survival. But maybe it would be possible to reduce the number of individuals so much that reproduction became problematic. I imagine a species confined to an island or something might be susceptible.

I'm asking this because in an interview I saw, an epidemiologist said that his usual research interest are ""bugs with species ending potential"". The interview was on COVID-19 so he didn't elaborate on what he meant by that or give any examples.

For the special case of humans, I was able to find this article that claims such an event to be unlikely, but I suppose we are the best equipped species that has ever existed on this planet to deal with such a threat.
","From the vantage point of other species, humans might be considered ""bugs"" in the sense that we are organisms that are causal in the ongoing extinction of numerous species. We're doing a pretty good job of it, so far:


  The included extinctions span numerous families of plants[4] and animals, including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and arthropods. With widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats such as coral reefs and rainforests, as well as other areas, the vast majority of these extinctions are thought to be undocumented, as the species are undiscovered at the time of their extinction, or no one has yet discovered their extinction.   The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background rates.

"
"I'm looking for biological datasets with specific properties that are available for me to analyze. Informally put, I have a hammer and I am looking for a nail. That is to say, I have an algorithm and I am looking for suitable data to test if it can tell us anything interesting about biology. Let me start by characterizing the properties that I'd like this data to have.

Math Properties

The data must be representable as signed directed graphs, which in less formal terms means that I am looking for a network where the connections between the nodes are arrows with a +/- sign associated with them. 

The signed property of the edges must represent a property of the relation between discrete objects that only takes on one of two values. One way to get signed values from quantitative data would be to use the sign function, keeping only the relations whose sign of the quantitative variable were not equal to zero. Another way is to encode Boolean values, where False is - and True is +. I'd like to further clarify that the data should not only conform to this criteria, but should have instances of both positive and negative paths within the data.

The directed property of the edges mean that we care to distinguish 'A relates to B' from 'B relates to A'; order matters. Both, one, or neither of these relations can hold in these networks between any two nodes A and B. 

Data Properties

The data must be analyzable in the sense that I can obtain the data in a form where I can either (1) immediately analyze the data or (2) transform/manipulate the data into a form that I can analyze. As a computer programmer, I'm likely to be able to find packages for (or code for myself) moderately arbitrary transformations as long as they are computable and interpretable. That is to say, in your answer I would like you to not worry too much about whether you have a ready-to-use software solution for analyzing or transforming the data. What I would like considered is whether there is (1) a direct download for a/the datafile(s) or (2) an application programming interface (API) for downloading the data in either pieces or as a whole. 

Preference will be given to answers that do not cost money, and do not require creating accounts (although either are acceptable). 

All else being equal, I'd prefer larger datasets (n > 1000) over smaller ones. 

Preference will also be given to answers where the dataset has additional variables are available on the vertices. For example, if the vertices represent genes, then additional variables on the vertices would mean more data is available that describe those genes.

Academic Properties

The dataset(s) should be citable.

Examples

While I'm open to other biological subjects, there are two biological topics that I feel should be representable in the mathematical way I've described above.

The first is gene regulation data. The vertices would be genes, and for any two genes A and B we could have any of the following relations


Gene A downregulates Gene B
Gene A upregulates Gene B
Gene B downregulates Gene A
Gene B upregulates Gene A


The second example I've thought of is in biological signaling as the signals are sometimes directional (sender to receiver) and might have some sort of sign (turn on/off, increase/decrease).

Bonus points if the data is topical (COVID-19/coronavirus-related for example).

Data Sources

I've downloaded a few datasets from BioGrid, but I didn't see the kinds of mathematical properties I was looking for in those datasets. If there are datasets here that you think meet my criterion, please mention them.
","While this does look like a very nice approach, I would actually argue that there are (almost) no biological datasets, that can be directly used for your algorithm - you can only do a sort of meta analysis using results/predictions based on other datasets.

The reason for this is that the nature of a signed graph requires you to look at effects that can have opposite directions, which in biology  pretty much restricts you to regulatory functions*. The problem with that is, that is nearly impossible to directly measure regulatory effects. In all cases I am aware of, one has to measure the magnitude of an effect under different conditions and then calculate regulatory interactions based on that data.

This means any set of regulatory interactions you can put out into your network is already based on a given analysis with inherent assumptions and (potentially) biases.  

This doesn't make the approach impossible, but I do think, it is something you need to be aware of, especially if you want to use multiple datasets.

As for actual datasets that would fit well:


transcription factors have already been mentioned in another answer
other regulatory effects on transcriptions (promoters / enhancers) may also work, though in this case the 'class' of the objects effected (genes/mRNA) is different than the effector
Another type of biological network that might fit are metabolic / enzymatic pathways. For these you could either also look at regulatory interactions (which again may be tricky because both proteins and metabolites can have regulatory effects) or maybe also directly at metabolic flow: in this case nodes in the graph would represent metabolites and edges reactions that produce or consume them. The KEGG database has large numbers of metabolic pathways for many different species.




*I was trying to think of other things, but presence/absence of a signal probably doesn't fit and neither does classification into strong/weak signals (i.e. interactions)
"
"This question comes about from another virology question concerning the common cold (Would being infected with every kind of cold virus strain at once be a good immunization or dangerous?).

The original edit stated that there are over 200 different viruses which cause the common cold, and after reading the linked Wikipedia article, it said just under the intro panel (the bit with a representation of a virus) what I believed to confirm my initial thought, that it is virus strains not different viruses.


  Well over 200 virus strains are implicated in causing the common cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common.


So I commented the fact and after editing to suit, the author responded with (emphasis mine)


  @Chris Rogers How do you explain this from wiki?The common cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. The most commonly implicated virus is a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes.[29][30] Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronavirus (≈ 15%),[31][32] influenza viruses (10–15%),[33] adenoviruses (5%),[33] human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and metapneumovirus.[34] Frequently more than one virus is present.[35] In total over 200 viral types are associated with colds.[3]


I have not been able to find anything online the difference between the two (if there are any). Are the rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, metapneumoviruses etc. involved different strains of the same virus or are they different viruses all together?
","It is often said that a common cold can be caused by more than 200 different ""specific viruses"" (rhinovirus, influenza virus...), which suggests 200 virus species, but there are other levels of categorization of viruses (families, genera, ""types,"" etc.), so this can be a bit of apples and oranges situation, but in any case, 200 specific viruses does not mean 200 strains.


  More than 200 different viruses are known to cause the symptoms of
  the common cold. (National Institute of Health)
  
  The common cold is an upper respiratory infection that is caused by
  several families of viruses. Within these virus families, more
  than 200 specific viruses that can cause the common cold have been
  identified. The virus family that causes the most colds is called
  rhinovirus. Rhinoviruses cause up to 40% of colds, and this virus
  family has at least 100 distinct virus types in its group. Other
  important upper respiratory virus families are named coronavirus,
  adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Since so many viruses can
  cause cold symptoms, development of a vaccine for the common cold has
  not been possible. (Harvard Medical School)


Each species of a virus can further appear as different strains.


  In biology, a strain is a low-level taxonomic rank used at the
  intraspecific level (within a species). (Wikipedia)


For example, all different strains of influenza virus will be still called influenza virus and the detailed name will be used only for laboratory/research purposes, not for the ""public."" 



Every year different strains of influenza virus appear, so every year a new vaccine targeted to those strains needs to be developed to be effective.
"
"If I get infected once with the virus which causes a common cold, does that mean I will not get infected with the same strain of the virus ever in my lifetime? 

Is the immune system capable and smart enough to recognize the viruses that have infected me in the past,  and kill them before it initiates its incubation within a cell? If so, why do I keep getting a common cold again and again? Do I keep exposing myself to a new different strain of the same virus?

Based on the fact that there are over 200 different types of viruses that cause a common cold. To what extent do you think creating a universal vaccine for the common cold could be successful, and what are the challenges facing scientists in creating a successful universal vaccine?
","
  If I get infected once with the virus which causes a common cold, does that mean I will not get infected with the same strain of the virus ever in my lifetime? 


It depends on quirks of your immune system and the viral load you're exposed to, but in theory (based on vaccination and other studies), presence of the virus will trigger a suppressive response, not to nasal mucosal invasion but to viral replication and cell destruction/inflammation to the degree that you clinically manifest ""a cold"".  

Regarding your quirks,


  The persistence of high-titer serotype-specific antibody is associated with protection from infection as well as reduced symptom severity following experimental challenge with the same serotype (52). However, there is little cross-neutralization among serotypes, which presents a challenge to vaccine development, given that there are more than 100 different known HRV serotypes (53). Further support for the role of humoral immunity in the prevention and control of HRV infection was observed in a study of patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia. These patients experienced more frequent and severe HRV infections than their healthy spouses despite the administration of replacement immunoglobulin therapy (54).


That's only the beginning. Immunology is very complex.


  To what extent do you think creating a universal vaccine for the common cold could be successful...


Close to, if not, zero.

There are about 120 distinctly different serotypes of rhinovirus which cause the ""common cold"", which could require 120 separate vaccines. Also a significant percentage of ""colds"" are caused by other types of viruses (coronavirus - like tat in China right now, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza and parainfluenza viruses) as well as some bacteria.


  Human coronaviruses, members of the Coronaviridae family, were first identified in 1962 and have been particularly difficult to isolate by use of standard cell culture techniques.


One needs to reliably grow a virus before making a vaccine.


  Efforts at vaccine development are hindered by the existence of more than 100 HRV serotypes with high-level sequence variability in the antigenic sites.


And


  Compared to patients with coronavirus-associated colds, there is no difference in respiratory symptom severity or duration.


However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel: the older you get, the fewer new viruses you're exposed to (if you stay in one geograpical location), and the fewer colds you get. I haven't had a ""common cold"" in a few years now. If I move across the continent, I will have more colds.

"According to the data on the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Tracker, as of 3rd February 2020 there were 17491 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, 536 total recoveries and 362 deaths.
From my non-expert calculation this implies a mortality rate of:

(Nd / (Nd + Nr)) * 100 = 41%

where:

Nd is the total number of deaths,
Nr is the total number of full recoveries.

This leaves 16593 people still suffering from the disease who have neither recovered or died.

This is in stark contrast to the publicly disseminated value of ~2% mortality, so have I made a mistake in my calculation or assumptions, or is COVID-19 much more dangerous than commonly claimed?  

[After a helpful discussion in the comments, 'mortality rate' is not the correct term to use here, instead I should say 'Case Fatality Rate'.]
","The definition of mortality rate that you've given does not match any practical definition I'm familiar with.*

When people talk about the mortality rate of a disease, what they usually mean is the case fatality rate or the death-to-case ratio, which is simply defined as Nd /  Ni, where  Nd is the number of deaths attributed to the disease over a given time period and Ni is the total number of new cases of the disease observed during the same time period.  By this definition, the current case fatality rate of 2019-nCov according to your quoted figures is 362 / 17491 ≈ 2.07%.

(The tracker seems to have been updated since you asked your question, and now lists a total of 20679 confirmed cases and 427 deaths, for a CFR of 427 / 20679 ≈ 2.06%.)

*) As a theoretical definition of the mortality rate in the long run, when all infected patients have either died or recovered, it can sort of make sense.  But then it becomes equivalent to the usual definition of the case fatality rate.



To compare this with your definition of ""mortality rate"" (as Nd /  (Nd + Nr), where Nr is the number of individuals who have recovered from the disease), we need to start by observing that there's no single universal and unambiguous definition of what ""recovering from a disease"" means.  Commonly used definitions tend to be something like ""no symptoms for X days"" and/or ""viral load below N particles per mL for X days"" or simply ""whenever a doctor declares that you're healthy again and lets you out of the hospital"".

Now, let's say that we're using a (somewhat) objective definition of recovery like ""no detectable symptoms for two days"".  The first observation is that any epidemic first observed less than two days ago would, according to your definition, inevitably have a mortality rate of 100% simply because none of the people infected so far would have had time to be considered definitely recovered yet.  (That is assuming that at least one person had died from the infection; otherwise both the numerator and the denominator would be zero, and the rate thus undefined.)

Further, even after some of the earliest cases have been symptom-free long enough to be counted as recovered, your definition would still yield a highly upwards biased estimate of the ""true"" long-term fatality rate during the early phase of the epidemic, when the number of new cases per day is still increasing.  This is because, for most infectious diseases, any deaths typically occur when the disease is at its most severe state, whereas those who survive the disease will then experience a gradual decline in symptoms as their immune system succeeds in halting and reversing the progress of the infection.



For an illustrative example, let's consider a hypothetical disease with a theoretical 1% long-term average CFR — that is to say, exactly 1% of all (recognizably) infected patients will die of the disease.  Let's further assume that this disease typically takes two days to progress from the initial onset of recognizable symptoms to the state of maximum severity, which is when most of the deaths occur.  After this, assuming that the patient survives, the symptoms gradually decline over the following three days.  As remission is possible (but rare), doctors will generally consider a patient recovered only after showing no symptoms for at least two days.  Thus, a typical case would progress as follows:


  onset of symptoms → increasing symptoms (2 days) → peak severity → declining symptoms (3 days) → no symptoms → observation (2 days) → officially recovered (total time: approx. 7 days from onset)


or, for the 1% of patients for whom the disease is fatal:


  onset of symptoms → increasing symptoms (2 days) → death (total time: approx. 2 days from onset)


Now, let's assume that, during the early period of an epidemic when the infection is still spreading exponentially, the number of new cases increases by a factor of 10 every three days.  Thus, during this period, the number of new cases, recoveries and deaths per day might grow approximately as follows (assuming for the sake of the example that exactly 1%, rounded down, of the patients diagnosed on each day will die two days later):

    |     cases     |   recovered   |     deaths    |         |            |  
day |   new | total |   new | total |   new | total | Nd / Ni | Nd/(Nd+Nr) |
----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---------+------------+

  7 |   100 |   188 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |
  8 |   200 |   388 |     1 |     1 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |       0.0% |

 12 |  5000 |  8888 |    20 |    38 |    10 |    18 |   0.20% |      32.1% |


As you can see from the table above, naïvely calculating the case fatality rate as (total number of deaths) / (total number of cases) during this exponential growth period does underestimate the true long-term CFR by a factor of (in this case) about 5 due to the two-day lag time between infection and death.  On the other hand, using your formula of (total deaths) / (total deaths + recovered) would overestimate the true CFR by a factor of about 30!

Meanwhile, let's assume that, after the first 12 days, the growth of the epidemic saturates at 10,000 new cases per day.  Now the total numbers will look like this:

    |     cases     |   recovered   |     deaths    |         |            |  
day |   new | total |   new | total |   new | total | Nd / Ni | Nd/(Nd+Nr) |
----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---------+------------+
 13 | 10000 | 18888 |    50 |    88 |    20 |    38 |   0.20% |      30.2% |
 14 | 10000 | 28888 |    99 |   187 |    50 |    88 |   0.30% |      32.0% |

 16 | 10000 | 48888 |   495 |   880 |   100 |   288 |   0.59% |      24.7% |
 17 | 10000 | 58888 |   990 |  1870 |   100 |   388 |   0.66% |      17.2% |
 18 | 10000 | 68888 |  1980 |  3850 |   100 |   488 |   0.71% |      11.2% |
 19 | 10000 | 78888 |  4950 |  8800 |   100 |   588 |   0.74% |       6.3% |
 20 | 10000 | 88888 |  9900 | 18700 |   100 |   688 |   0.77% |       3.5% |

As you can see, the two measures of mortality rate do eventually start converging as the growth of the epidemic slows down.  In fact, in the long run, as the majority of patients either recover or die, they do both end up converging to the ""true"" long-term case fatality rate of 1%.  But by then, the epidemic will be basically over.

There are various ways to obtain a more accurate estimate of the long-term fatality rate even during the early exponential growth phase of an epidemic.  One such method would be to look at the outcomes of a single cohort of patients diagnosed at the same time.  For our hypothetical example epidemic, looking e.g. at just the 1000 patients diagnosed on day 10, we could get an accurate estimate of the CFR by day 12 simply by dividing the 10 deaths within that cohort by the total number of patients in the cohort.  Furthermore, observing multiple cohorts would give us a pretty good idea of how long after diagnosis we would need to wait before the estimated case fatality rate for each cohort gets close to its final true value.

Unfortunately carrying out this kind of cohort analysis for 2019-nCov would require more detailed information than the tracker you've linked to provides.  Even the time series spreadsheet the tracker links to doesn't directly provide such detailed cohort data, although it might be possible to obtain better estimates from it by making some more or less reasonable assumptions about the typical progress of the disease.



Addendum: A few preliminary cohort studies of the kind I describe above do appear to have already been published for 2019-nCoV.

In particular, ""A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern"" by Wang et al. and ""Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China"" by Huang et al., both published on January 24 in The Lancet, note that, out of the first 41 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV before Jan 2, 2020 in Wuhan, six had died (and 28 had been discharged, leaving seven hospitalized) by Jan 22, giving a case fatality rate of 14.6% in this cohort.

However, they do advise treating this figure with due caution, noting a number of reasons (besides just the small number of cases examined) why it may not fully reflect the eventual long-term CFR:


  ""However, both of these [CFR] estimates [of 14.6% from the 41 patient cohort and of 2.9% from all 835 cases confirmed at the time of writing] should be treated with great caution because not all patients have concluded their illness (ie, recovered or died) and the true number of infections and full disease spectrum are unknown. Importantly, in emerging viral infection outbreaks the case-fatality ratio is often overestimated in the early stages because case detection is highly biased towards the more severe cases. As further data on the spectrum of mild or asymptomatic infection becomes available, one case of which was documented by Chan and colleagues, the case-fatality ratio is likely to decrease.""


There's also a later paper titled ""Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study"" by Chen et al., published on Jan 30, that examines a cohort of 99 patients diagnosed between Jan 1 to Jan 20 and reports a CFR of 11% within this cohort.  However, the study only followed these patients up to Jan 25, by which time more than half of them (57 out of 99) still remained hospitalized.

"Everyone knows (and passionately hates) the runny nose, coughing, sneezing, aching/sore joints, and the drowsiness associated with the cold. But these symptoms are just the body trying to get rid of the rhinovirus. What does the cold actually do to you, and what would happen if the body did not fight it? Would you just die?
","Common cold is one of the labels used to describe non specific infection of the upper respiratory tract. Other labels include acute rhinitis, acute rhinopharyngitis or acute coryza.

Upper respiratory tract infections (URI) can be caused by multiple virus families such as the rhinovirus (the most common cause of URI), the influenza virus, the coronavirus and the adenovirus.

While most of the URI share similar manifestations like rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, cough and sore throat, some symptoms may be much likely associated with a specific type of virus: myalgia and fatigue are commonly seen in influenza and parainfluenza infections, while conjunctivitis are often linked to adenovirus infection.

In general cases, URI are self limited diseases. However, some patients (children aged less than 1 year and adults aged more than 65 years, pregnant woman, and people of any age with comorbid illnesses) are at risk of developing complications. Pulmonary complications are the most frequent complications of influenza infection and are often associated with secondary bacterial infection that can lead to acute lung injury. The latter is associated with high mortality rate. Neuromuscular and cardiovascular complications are less common.

"Recently I caught a cold in presumably an amazingly short period of time (~6h). From prior infections I had the experience to have 24 to 48 hours ""left"" being a bit ill, before being forced to stay in bed. Observing my disease I asked myself what went different this time. In general I don't get ill too easy.


Morning: got to work as usual feeling reasonably well
12pm: ate some sushi bought from a supermarket
~3 pm: ate a bowl of strawberries - unwashed
6pm: already felt a scratchy throat
9pm: having a Skype call planning some event, starting to have a headache 
11pm: falling to bed really exhausted
I did not have contact with
visibly ill people during that day.


My theory now is, that the unwashed strawberries carried the pathogen. Here are some thoughts that might support this:


Since I got hit so fast I'm assuming being exposed to a high number of bacteria.
The pathogens where possibly passed by an ill harvester.
Strawberries being sweet, moist and un-chilled seem to be the perfect fertile ground for reproduction.
The incubation period of colds is usually a lot longer (2-5 days). Does a higher number of bacteria result in a shorter incubation period?
Washing the strawberries would have helped. The bacteria was just on the surface area, since the vessels of the strawberries of course where not alive anymore.


Am I right with my assumptions or did I miss something? I'd like you to confirm or debunk my theory of getting ill.

Thank you!
","Unlikely.

There are different viruses responsible for the symptoms grouped together as ""common cold"":

They all have been found to have an incubation period ranging from 2 up to 8 days. This includes ""normal"" infection, and I strongly doubt the strawberries will carry a lot more viruses than standard infections (see below). Only 5% of cases will have an incubation period shorter than 20 hours. Because they are distributed normally, it is very unlikely to have an incubation period of 3-6 hours, which is what you described.




  It is important to wash all fruit and vegetables before you eat them to ensure they are clean and safe to eat.
  Most people are aware of the importance of handling meat safely, but many consider the risk of food poisoning from vegetables to be low.
  ""It's a myth that a little bit of dirt doesn't do you any harm,"" says Dr Andrew Wadge, chief scientist of the Food Standards Agency (FSA).
  ""Soil can sometimes carry harmful bacteria and, although food producers have good systems in place to clean vegetables, the risk can never be entirely eliminated.""
  
  Source: NHS.uk


In the EU, imported fruits have a lot of regulations to match, and that they travel from the supplier to the consumer without being cleaned once is highly unlikely (still does happen sometimes, but highly unlikely). Because the gems can be quite devastating and infectious, on should always clean vegetables to prevent those to spread, but it doesn't seem too dangerous missing one out. 

Also, think about exponential growth. If the amount of viruses in your body were doubled every 2 hours (I don't have any numbers for that, but anything above seems unlikely), and your incubation time was 30 hours earlier than expected, you would have to have taken in 215 more viruses than the normally infected.



Most important:


  Since the virus is sensitive to pH and temperature, it replicates best below core body temperature and does not survive the acids found in the stomach, which means the virus does not infect the lower respiratory or gastrointestinal tract.
  
  Source: Morgridge Institute for Research


This makes it even more unlikely, because the virus only has time to reach the nasal area until you've swallowed it.



Bottom line: Think about yesterday or the day before. With whom did you shake hands and touched your face afterwards without washing your hands? Who did you stand next to that had a running nose?

"First when the Coronavirus outbreak happened in China, some people argued that the outbreak had to do with a supposed faulty chinese health care system, due to China not being a ""developed country"". But now in South Korea and Italy, supposed ""developed countries"" the cases are increasing even at over a 100% rate per day some days. Now in Italy the first cases appeared apparently in 31 January and in South Korea apparently in 20 January. So in 3 / 4 weeks those countries jumped from  units to hundreds / over a thousand cases. Yet in another ""developed country"" like Australia, the first case was reported 25 January , but the country was able to keep the number of cases below / in 23 for a month. 

Can be a factor contributing to the outbreaks in South Korea / Italy the fact that they are in the northern hemisphere / winter , and that Australia is in the southern hemisphere / summer by February? Could an outbreak as fast as those which happened in South Korea / Italy happen in a country which is in summer by the time it happens?
","This is not scientifically determined as of today (February 27, 2020). In other words: Nobody knows if temperature/climate/weather has an impact or not. See CDC website for detailed info on this aspect.

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html

I quote (as of February 27, 2020):

""Q: Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?

A: It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.""

"Can a full-head helmet with the visor closed prevent getting infected by the Corona virus during a casual interaction with a carrier?

For example, when buying something at a store or discussing something with someone for 10-15 minutes.

How does it compare with the protection provided by a standard face mask (that can be purchased at a pharmacy)?
","I think it's a great idea. It protects your eyes from respiratory droplets and keeps you from touching your face. I don't know how well it would work from keeping droplet from reaching your mouth, but probably pretty well, especially if you used it with an N95 respirator. It might be a little shocking/intimidating to people, so I would only use it in extremely infected areas. 
"
"In China, the largest number of reported COVID-19 infections was in Hubei province.

Other countries are experiencing exponential increase in reported infections, while the remainder of China is reporting relatively small numbers of casessource_1

What protects Chinese provinces other than Hubei from COVID-19 outbreak?


What is different about the remainder of China compared to the rest of the world?
Is there anything we can learn from the provinces in China that so far were less affected by the virus than Hubei?

","I live in Guangdong, and this is what I've been seeing &amp; reading about.

Wuhan (city in Hubei) is where the outbreak supposedly began. And it went unnoticed for a while, which mean it was spreading locally more-so than it was spreading nationally/internationally. Near at the start of the Chinese New Year holiday, the government decided to quarantine all of Hubei province. So while other provinces already had infected people, they spread hadn't grown as significantly as it had in Hubei yet.

The Chinese government then decided to take specific measures to control the epidemic. For starters, they required mask-wearing and encouraged staying indoors. They also began to set up body temperature checks all over the place (apartments, neighborhoods, roads leading into cities, and places of work once the holiday ended. Fever seems to be the first symptom, so this is why).

If anyone in an apartment building was confirmed to have the virus, then the entire building and all residents were/are quarantined for 14 days (happened to a 30+ story apartment building next to mine). Elevators, doors, and other public spaces are often disinfected, particularly if a suspected case had been in the area. Again, I saw this at a temperature checkpoint, someone must've had a fever and a little bit later some folks came and sprayed down the area.

Schools are also closed in all provinces across the country, and students are doing online schooling. Some companies are also allowing employees to work from home, or 'staggering' their work days (half come in into the office on Mon, Wed, Fri, the other half come in Tuesday and Thursday). This decreases the number of people a possible infected person can pass the virus to.

On top of this, companies needed to 'apply' to be able to resume work. Here in Shenzhen, nobody could return to work within 14 days of returning from the city, assuming they left during the holiday. We also need to record down our body temp when coming to and leaving from work. According to an SMS I received from the local government, if 2 employees have a body temperature >= 37.3C, then it needs to be reported immediately, as it indicates a possible spread in that workplace.

In short, the virus was able to take a foothold in Hubei, and it was noticed before it took a significant foothold in other provinces. Therefore other provinces had time to implement proactive and preventative measures, before the situation grew to Hubei-level of significance.

The best way to prevent it from spreading is simple steps, such as not going outside unless its necessary, avoid close contact with others (defined as within 6 feet for an extended period of time), washing your hands, and disinfecting often-touched surfaces like door knobs, keyboards, cell phones, etc. It remains to be seen whether other countries will take the same rather drastic measures that are being taken in China, I suppose it all depends on how bad things get in other countries.

"There is such piece of the dialog between journalist and the doctor (in the middle of an interview about Coronavirus):
-If somebody's coughing on the bus should you get off?
-No, getting off isn't gonna help.

Why?
","There are three possibilities when someone is coughing on the bus:


they don't have Coronavirus -- or even a virus at all. I coughed a lot when my lungs were full of tumours. Some people cough when their asthma is acting up. This is by far the most common case.
they do have Coronavirus and are not wearing a mask. You are more than 2 metres away from them. This is most of the bus, even in the unlikely event that someone on the bus is infected. 
they do have Coronavirus, are not wearing a mask, and are less than 2 metres from you. Droplets may already have landed on you. Getting off will not stop that.


While on the bus, do not touch your face. When you get off the bus, sanitize your hands or wash them with soap and water if you can. Now it no longer matters whether droplets landed on you.

Notice that the CDC advice doesn't say ""if you find yourself near someone coughing, get away from them as soon as you can."" Doing so is either unnecessary (first two bullets) or won't help (last bullet - it's too late, but handwashing will save you anyway.)
"
"It is my understanding that ""epidemic"" is an abnormally high amount of cases than expected. ""Pandemic"" refers to a epidemic that crosses continents (Please correct my understanding if it is wrong).

My question is should coronavirus (that is, covid-19) be considered a ""pandemic"" ar this point, or is there some other criteria it would need to fulfill to be considered a ""pandemic""? Perhaps an organization like WHO would need to designate it as a ""pandemic""?
","note: as can be expected from a dynamic event, this answer has changed a bit. The WHO now considers COVID-19 a pandemic; when this answer was initially written, they did not: see the update at the end.

According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases as reported by CNN:


  ""It really is borderline semantics, to be honest with you,"" Fauci said.
  
  ""I think you could have people arguing each end of it,"" he said. ""Pandemics mean different things to different people.""


The word pandemic itself refers to:


  an epidemic of disease that has spread across a large region; for instance multiple continents, or worldwide.


Given a broad definition like this one, it seems like yes, you could make a case that this is already a pandemic: COVID-19 is found on all richly inhabited continents and is continuing to spread.

However, there are still many places that have few cases compared to the outbreak centers, and only a tiny percentage of the world population is known to have been infected (the latest WHO report covers nearly 91,000 cases, a large number, but a tiny percentage: only 0.0012% of the world population of over 7.5 billion).

By comparison, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic infected 11–21% of the world population.

Organizations like the WHO have a more stringent operational definition of ""pandemic"", and none that I am aware of at this point have used the ""pandemic"" classification yet in an official pronouncement.

So, if instead of using a broad dictionary interpretation of ""pandemic"", we say: ""considered a pandemic means a reputable global health organization classifies a pandemic"", then the answer is:

No, COVID-19 is not yet considered a pandemic as of March 3rd, 2020.

Ultimately, it doesn't really matter whether the pandemic term is applied or not. It makes most sense to think in terms of actual numbers and the situation ""on the ground"", and to compare those to past outbreaks rather than worrying about the definition or declaration of ""pandemic.""

Update March 11th

As of March 11th, 2020, the WHO now considers COVID-19 to be a pandemic. Consistent with this answer, the WHO stresses that this doesn't really change their guidance:


  ""Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO’s assessment of the threat posed by this #coronavirus. It doesn’t change what WHO is doing, and it doesn’t change what countries should do""-
  @DrTedros

"Today the CDC released an official list of what kills the COVID-19 virus but the list does not mention 70% isopropyl alcohol.

This is a fairly basic disinfectant and it seems it should have been on the list assuming it kills the virus and that is why I am asking. Thank you
","Yes, it does.

According to the CDC, this is how surfaces should be disinfected:


  Surfaces
  
  
  Wear disposable gloves when cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. Gloves should be discarded after each cleaning. If reusable gloves are
  used, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection
  of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other purposes.
  Consult the manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning and disinfection
  products used. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.
  If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
  For disinfection, diluted household bleach solutions, alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and most common EPA-registered
  household disinfectants should be effective.
  
  
  Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application
  and proper ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its
  expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other
  cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against
  coronaviruses when properly diluted.
  
  
  Prepare a bleach solution by mixing:
  
  
  5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water or
  4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water
  
  
  A list of products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims, maintained by the American Chemistry Council Center for
  Biocide Chemistries (CBC), is available at:
  https://www.americanchemistry.com/Novel-Coronavirus-Fighting-Products-List.pdf.
  Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims are
  expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to
  kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning
  and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and
  contact time, etc.).
  
  For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes, remove visible contamination if present and clean with
  appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After
  cleaning: Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the
  manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items using the
  warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items
  completely, or Use products with the EPA-approved emerging viral
  pathogens claims (examples at this linkpdf iconexternal icon) that are
  suitable for porous surfaces.

"The last days (begining of March 2020) active cases of Coronavirus from China dropped in a rate of 1,000-2,000 per day. China is the only country which is being able to reduce the amount of active cases, assuming the information which is coming from China is true. 

Is there any identified policy China is doing to succesfully reduce Coronavirus cases, the other countries arent using?
","Containment

The most important factor is containment:


In the epicenter 60 million people were locked down. So if you can't leave your home you can't infect others nor get infected by others.
Across the country 780 million people were under travel restrictions.
Some areas only one family member is allowed to leave the home every 2 days to get supplies.
Community Committees (non existent in most other countries) deliver food and check on condition of those locked down.


Today China is changing into ""targeted containment"" where certain cities with no new cases for five days still have borders closed but allow citizens to now move freely within city borders.

Some other considerations:


China is very nimble in setting up a 1,000 bed hospital in a week (16 were setup I believe).
China was quick to develop a 15 minute test kit for Novel Coronavirus]2. This allows infected people to be quickly separated and allows those not infected to continue without undue fear or restrictions on work, school or family relations. By comparison US refused (for a week) to test people in a deadly infected Washington State Nursing Home where at least 50 staff in inmates, um er residents, are showing symptoms.
CT scans. When labs could no longer keep up to number of test samples, hospitals in China resorted to cat scans of the lungs as reported February 13th. There have been no reports in the media if US hospitals have CT scanning machines that doctors know how to read to classify a patient as ""presumptive positive"". There was mild upheaval when China included CT scan cases in their daily reports.




What ""we"" started doing March 8, 2020 similar to China

You don't say who ""we"" are but I presume it is EU / North America. From that point of view Italy has just implemented a policy a little less strict than China today. The daily link contents will change tomorrow so I'll include March 8, 2020 (GMT) link contents here:


  ITALY EMERGENCY MEASURES
  
  16 days after the beginning of the outbreak, the Italian government
  took decree today to take exceptional measures to contain about 16
  million Italians living in 14 provinces in the north of the country,
  as well as restrictive measures covering the whole country. [source]
  
  Northern Italy under lockdown
  
  (... SNIP original March 8, 2020 post shortened on March 12, 2020...)
  
  
  Sports competitions are suspended with some exceptions
  


Had the national restrictions been implimented a fortnight ago the lockdown may have been less severe today (March 8, 2020). 

Also note like China, Italy has been using the 15 minute test kit presumably backed up by the two to five day lab testing which they say is more accurate.



March 9, 2020 update

Today Italy expanded the ""lockdown"" to the entire nation of 60 million people. Still it isn't as targeted a restriction as China implemented against Wuhan and the province it was in (circles of protection like Linux Kernel and User Space tools).

Today Israel announced all people coming into the country must undergo 14 day quarantine. This would include all Americans who historically have been the biggest supporters and creators of Israel.

Note Israel's actions go above and beyond the steps China has taken. It more akin to the steps some regions took during the Spanish Flu of 1918. Sorry direct link not available I recall researching this a few days / week ago.

Although Israel is using a stronger tactic than which China took two things have to be considered:


People weren't swarming to get to China in February 2020 with USA
declaring it Persona Non-Grata in nation terms.  
Benjamin Netenyahu is facing American Style impeachment and might be using people and this growing pandemic as a ""human shield"" of sorts from his personal problems.


I think the 15 minute field test kit which takes blood sample was what made China successful but only they can answer that and the MSM I have access to isn't asking those questions to seek answers. Currently schools are closing down in USA and other western countries because someone came back from an infected country without giving them a 15 minute field blood test first.



March 10, 2020 Update

Correction to yesterday

I read in Haeratz (sp?) Newspaper online today that Netenyahu exempted Israeli's returning from America from the 14 day quarantine. I don't believe any science backs up the fact returning from a special mission to America exempts one from the Coronavirus.

Lab tests can fail too

Alarmingly in Japan someone infected on the Princess Cruise ship and then cleared for release was still infected because 15 minute blood test wasn't done, just the swab lab test. Note the link is only valid for 24 hours then you have to scroll to March 10:



China developed the 15 minute field test kit on January 31, 2020 and an American company claims to have developed the same 15 minute field test kit. Both are banned by the American CDC though because it measures those who have antibodies fighting the CoronaVirus (stage 1) and antibodies that have defeated the Coronavirus (stage 2). It does not test for the Coronavirus itself.

If you know who has defeated the Coronavirus and have antibodies they are the safest people to have assisting the at risk segment of the population. China nor any other country has said they are doing this though.

Screening everyone crossing the land/air/sea border with a 15 minute test would go a long way to slowing down the virus spread. I hope the reason for not using the 15 minute test isn't because there isn't enough profit in it for labs. Remember to date ""our"" labs have mostly test people who don't have the virus. With the 15 minute test kit they would be testing people who 90% odds do have the virus.

New Rochelle New York State takes a page from China's play book

Tomorrow the Army is moving into New York according to Aljazeera TV to seal off the city and not let anyone leave. Plus they will distribute food to those in quarantine which mimics what China's community committees were doing as posted earlier.

This disease for America and EU is unique in that the ""jet-setters"" / wealthy like the rich Northern region of Italy (initial ground zero) are the global spreaders of the disease (besides local transmission which takes of a week or two later).

The downfall of this lockdown in New York state is it is announced two days before it takes effect giving infected people time to flee and infect others. Had those fleeing been tested it would have mitigated / reduced the chances of virus spread.

To Mask or not to Mask that is the question.

Coronavirus: put a surgical mask on, Hong Kong welfare chief Law Chi-kwong told

A survey of nurses in America recently revealed many of them were never trained on how to put on PPE yet this is construction worker safety 101 (at least it was when I was working in construction and not warehousing).

Green/Yellow/Red barcodes

China is using colour coded identification for people in Wuhan (ground zero) according to Aljazeera just now. Green = good to go, Yellow = warning, Red = No go. The government controls colour code assignments it was not reported how the colour codes are derived but it might be beneficial for other nations' red-tape departments to learn.



March 11, 2020 Update

Today Italy changed the lock-down to a shutdown:


  Italy closes all commercial activities, offices, cafes, shops. Only
  transportation, pharmacies, groceries will remain open


This sounds a lot like what China did for Wuhan and surrounding area.

Today the WHO (World Health Organization) declared the New Coronavirus (circa 2019) a global pandemic in hopes it will spur ""our"" governments to take more aggressive measures to contain the virus. In other words to be more like China which is what the OP is asking above.

USA announces all flights from Europe will be cancelled

Effective Friday March 13th the USA will ban all flights from Europe. The more important thing would be to track down all people who arrived from Europe over the last 14 days and test them. Flights from UK are still allowed but no word if Chunnel will be closed. UK has not announced a vote for CVexit.



March 12, 2020 Update

Canada's Prime Minister

The wife of the Prime Minister of Canada is suspected of being infected from in the United Kingdom on a speaking engagement (a high risk adventure IMO):


  In a press release on Thursday, the Prime Minister’s Office said she
  has received a test for the new coronavirus after her symptoms emerged
  last night following her return from a trip to the U.K., where she had
  been doing speaking engagements.
  
  While the prime minister has no symptoms, he is self-isolating until
  her test results are back.
  
  “The doctor’s advice to the prime minister is to continue daily
  activities while self-monitoring, given he is exhibiting no symptoms
  himself. However, out of an abundance of caution, the prime minister
  is opting to self-isolate and work from home until receiving Sophie’s
  results,” the release said.


The Prime Minister's Doctor gave the wrong advise. At my workplace yesterday they announced a coworker was being tested (4 days for results) and is self isolate because his wife works with a Doctor who had tested positive. So we have two health ""professionals"" the one in Ottawa Canada playing fast &amp; loose, the one in Edmonton Canada erring on the side of caution.

Everyone at work is worrying now. I wish we had the 15 minute field test kit so we can quickly separate the ""suspected wheat"" from the ""suspected chaff"". The good news is unlike the USA we can do tests on possible cases here in Edmonton Canada. Tom Hanks is also thankful today he could be tested in positive Australia and wasn't in the USA would they would refuse to test him.

China is a surveillance state which can control social media and MSM for sure. Canada and USA could utilize the anti-terrorism network built a decade ago including no-fly lists and turn it into a ""anti-coronavirus"" network. Another example of what ""we"" could be doing more like China using existing computer databases and surveillance tracking resources.

What Alberta announced today

EDMONTON -- As part of a new aggressive measure to fight the coronavirus pandemic, Alberta is cancelling all large gatherings and advising against international travel. Furthermore the link states:


  The province is advising Albertans against travelling
  internationally.
  
  ""Given the rapid spread of this virus, it is no longer possible to
  assess health risks for the duration of the trip,"" Hinshaw said.
  
  She is also recommending all Albertans currently outside of Canada to
  self-isolate for 14 days after their trip.
  
  Hinshaw said the risk of contracting coronavirus in Alberta has not
  changed in the past 24 hours, but is concerned that international
  travellers will continue to bring the disease into the province.


With only 23 confirmed cases Alberta is taking early steps to contain the virus without overreacting. The next steps (if cases increase) would be to close beauty parlours, bars and restaurants but I'm biased as I never frequent such establishments. Also I would stop sending fire fighters to non-essential traffic accidents and paramedic responses to save them for well, fighting fires. Random thought would be for Alberta to have disposable surgical gloves at self-serve gas stations for patrons to don before grasping the nozzle to fill up the tank.

Another possible step would be to begin skype (TVOIP) talks with Canadian Military which has a base close to Edmonton with feasibility of ""drafting"" Canadian troops living there. The purpose is for embedding troops with Edmonton Peace Officers and Edmonton Police in a combined ""counter-coronavirus-force"" under a central command and control.

Why troops? It was what my first bus driver after work (I take four buses home after work and am concerned they will shut down in two to three weeks and I'll have to buy a bicycle) said today: ""I hope the banks don't run out of money. This led to a long explanation about fractional reserve banking, gold standard, four Federal Reserve Central banks going bankrupt, currency generated digitally and how not enough real money exists. Anyway more fire power is preferable to not enough when you need it. Besides even if heavy weaponry isn't needed you can always call it a drill and lets face it NATO military doesn't see much ""action"" anyway and will enjoy the ""call to arms"" if nothing else.

Staying on topic, there are no reports I've read that China took these steps and used the military but I ""imagine"" they would have.



March 14, 2020 Update

Getting downvotes so might have to end these ""Save the World who doesn't care Q&amp;A"" updates.

Today Italy announced:


  Italy's health system is overwhelmed:
  
  
  ""We're close to the point of no return for intensive care beds in Lombardy. We have 15 to 20 intensive care beds left. With 85 new
  people entering ICU every day and 2 or 3 leaving, we're close to the
  point of no return. ""There are no more ambulances"" - Lombardy Welfare
  Councilor Gallera added - ""and therefore someone will have to wait
  late in the evening."" [source] 732 patients are currently treated in
  intensive care in Lombardy, and 76 new deaths were reported in the
  region today.
  In Bergamo, ""deaths have quintupled from a week ago. There is a burial every half hour"" said Councilor for Cemetery Services Giacomo
  Angeloni. ""There are many elderly people at home with breathing
  difficulties. They are not hospitalized because the hospitals are
  full"" said the mayor of Alzano Lombardo Carmelo Bertocchi.
  


What would China do?

Hard to say their society is different. What should Italy do? Easier to say if they are like Canada.

Temporarily suspend medical laws. Commandeer white crew cab pickup trucks from dealers at cost plus twenty. Paint red crosses on left and right. Staff with four able-bodied young men. Put a mattress in the box.

Take that 80 person call center designed to rip off seniors with calls to support the Fireman's Burn Unit and Police feed the children fund. Have them call people over 65 twice a day. If they don't answer send aforementioned four men in a pick up truck.

A week ago China would have build 1,000 bed hospitals that take a week to complete. NATO countries should do the same a week before where Italy is today. Scrap white collar surveyors, architects and engineers. Send in the blue collar labourers, concrete finishers, electricians, plumbers, skid steer operators, truck drivers, crane operators, foremen and carpenters with blue prints that China used.

Spain's lockdown today should have exempted warehousing and transportation of food and drugs workers. They will think of that tomorrow.

President Trump's test announced today seems like ""fake news"" if the test only works when upper respiratory tract is infected when a nasal swab is taken. However the kind of test taken was not announced.

China web guru is donated 500,000 test kits to USA today. No word if 100 labs and 1,000 lab workers are included to analyze test results...

I visited the world's second largest mall today. I noticed the indoor hockey rink was closed (like the NHL (I could fix that in a week I think)) and replaced with a bead trinket / fake rock sales flea market. One vendor had a dry cough and another was wearing surgical gloves.

There was a sign outside the bathroom hallway from Alberta Health advising people how to wash hands. At Galaxy land I saw a few amusement ride employees cleaning surfaces. So if they close all the schools here they end up in Galaxy land?

Schools should stay open because teachers know their students better than a random ride attendant. However reinstate the old days where students queue when the first bell rings. Then forehead point and shoot temperature checks will be done.

Allergy season is arriving and probably 10% of the population is effected with running nose and sneezing. They should get a card or something to alleviate the fears of others on the bus or airplane.

People under 30 getting and recovering from BSC should be verified and coveted. Being over 50 I'm not really scared but I'm worried I'll infect that elderly man hobbling down the street today at -20C with his cane. My bus may be no safer for him than ETS DATs. Which reminds me shouldn't they be cleaning the buses here?

Callous individuals surround us and say ""they are old"" lets kill them all with the virus. Forward thinkers will realize they will be old too someday. What would China do? I think they would ""respect their elders"".

Gee Jing Ping (Xi Jingping) wore a mask and sat meters away from other officials when he announced Wuhan (Think Washington DC) and Wubie Province (Think Washington State) had overcome the virus (we don't know that is true yet).

On the other hand Trump and officials wore no PPE and all touched the Mic in some sort of ""speaking is more important than reality"" press conference yesterday (Friday the 13th).

If someone on the bus wears a mask don't freak out. They may be trying to protect you or chances are they are just scared. Don't pick on them.

I have no idea if all of this transpired in China but their culture is different than NATO's and we must adapt because the end results are what count. Life, Liberty and Freedom can be mutually exclusive. For a few months you will have to give up Freedom to save Life. China did do that and appears to have succeeded today. What will history say about YOU?



March 16, 2020 Update

Today Canada announced closing borders to all foreign nationals except US citizens. What would China do?


About two weeks ago the border to Washington state would have been sealed off.
Because people there flow into B.C. the Alberta / BC border would have been sealed off.


What to do today to mimic China?


100 million people live beside the US / Canada border. They like to make day trips to mimic currency arbitrage and buy goods cheaper in other country. This traffic should be shut down.
Canadian health care is free, Americans in past have utilized that system, that should be shut down.
Everyone crossing border by land should be subject to 5 second forehead temperature check with $60 gun. Those with fever must seek medical attention.
Some border crossing like Edmundston New Brunswick and Madawaska, ME, United States are like their own little country. They can manage their own laws and have to worry about keeping outsiders out of both towns.


China succeeded at first locking down Wuhan City and then Hubie province. Italy tried that and failed. Canada / US appears headed for even bigger failure thinking it will save the economy. Perhaps it will in the short term but more long term planning is still needed:


Airlines will ask for bailouts. Tell them to go bankrupt and create new startups in a couple of years.
Edmonton schools are closing for six months. Send teachers out to work for four months even if it is sanitizing buses. After all you are making parents leave work to child care and still expect them to pay 12 months of school taxes right?
It's proposed to pay people unemployment. $800 every two weeks might be fine for 80% of the population but an airline pilot can't live on that if his mortgage and car payments are more than that per month. Don't give the money to company CEOs that lay off all the workers in order to support stock price.
Accept the fact Great Depression can be approaching and learn from those mistakes. People to plan to fail, they fail to plan - like with USA test kits.
Communism at $20/hour is better than capitalism with chance for $200/hr. when reality is $0/hr. No word if China will revert back to communism but their journey is shorter than Canada's would be and especially America's.
My bus driver was in a state of shock an hour ago as she was told tomorrow buses would be running on Saturday schedule which means that bus would not be running. The city bus website had no information on this. Don't make such knee-jerk reactions wait a week even if buses are 25% of capacity before making such announcements.
City of Edmonton website said one employee returning from vacation tested positive but it wasn't related to Recreational Facility or other services closing today. Makes me think it is swimming pool and wonders why they refuse to say?
Border closing by Canada and saying 14 self-isolation for all arriving (EXCEPT US CITIZENS who are immune to SARS 2.0 apparently) me they are math challenged. worldometers.com states some claim incubation period of 2 to 14 days with 5.2 days mean time which is what they are getting 14 from. Others say 0 to 28 days but that isn't the point. They should have said if you are arrived from Italy, Egypt, France, Germany, Washington State, Cruise Ship or blah blah 13 days ago then self isolate for 1 day, if 12 days ago then self isolate for 2 days, etc etc up to today arrivals isolate for 14 days.
No mention if doctors will be trained how to read CT scan of lungs.
No mention if blood test to measure SARS 2.0 anti-bodies will be done. Criminal negligence almost not learning what China learned and shared with the world.
Also consider giving bus drivers temperature guns so I can get my temperature checked twice a day too and self-isolate if necessary. Then call dispatch for mini-bus making circles picking feverish people up to pick them up. Travel by planes offer and border crossings offer great chances to take 5 second temperature check but you need to think out of the box sometimes. Research a few weeks ago revealed only 100 ICU beds in Edmonton and Ventilators can't be ordered over night but temperature guns can be ordered over night...
They warned us weeks ago to get 14 day supply and I did. Today Doug Ford of Ontario told people to stop buying and ""hoarding"". Make up your mind...


Final thoughts for what China would do?

They would lift sanctions against the people of Syria and Iran who suffered enough already in USA bid to cause social unrest due to mass human suffering.

Indeed sanctions against Iran and Syria in the first place, China would have voted down if such a measure was introduced in the United Nations Security Council. We can only imagine how decapitated the hospitals in Northern parts of Syria are now with White Helmets running amok to make Oscar award winning videos backed by the guns of ISIS. Witnessing the lies of test kits and extrapolating to other lies like White Helmets things begin to make sense. Would you like a cup of Karma with your reality check?

Crisis can be an opportunity for change and we can watch how China handles it and hopefully treat them as a three month indication to the future of Covidi-9.

RT reported that China sent medical experts and supplies to Italy after the EU denied support.

Edmonton closed schools today but high school kids were still traveling in buses and associating in groups. It does little good to close schools and still allow kids to associate. China locked down homes and anyone traveling had to produce national ID cards. There are no national ID cards in Canada, my only cards are a debit card and library card (closed in Edmonton as of today). I also carry a bus pass which might have limited value starting tomorrow...

OP's valid question what did China do is almost totally ignored by the Media here whilst USA tries to steal vaccines from other nations to make a fast buck for Trump. Lets make this clear if and when a vaccine is create dit belongs to BSC (Bat Sourced Coronavirus) owner in China who gives it away to the world for free. No patents. No arguments. That said SARS 1.0 vaccine was 13 years in the making before being scrapped in 2016. The world has to stop focusing on maybe's and deal with reality that changes by the hour and is unique to every region and the resources they have in play.

This reminds me of Inventory Control training at work where last week he had to reverse adjustments to stock so this week he has to do the same thing for a different SKU. WRONG. It's on a case by case basis and every case is different. Open your universities 24/7 to develop a vaccine and analyze all those drive through test samples sure. Closing them is about the worst thing you could have done with available resources...

Where are the flight manifests of everyone who arrived from Italy, Germany and the Netherlands over the last 30 days? Were they given to the city of Edmonton Police? Real judges have subpoena powers. It's great you closed BS family court with he-said she-said soap opera now lets get the real judges and real law enforcement working. Politicians with silver spoons including Trudeau &amp; Trump have no idea of how the real world works.

China and Korea (both Republic and Democratic sides) seem to have their act together. As does New Zealand one of the ""five Eyes"" which seems to have had their eye open. Putin and Netenyahu seem more concerned with political extensions. Trump saw a picture of him photo-shopped image playing the violin and tweeted he likes it whilst completely oblivious to the reference ""Nero fiddled while Rome burned"". The media is devoting too much attention to politicians and not doing investigative journalism. Four words; Fifteen Minute Blood Test. Since you have ten fingers three more; Border Temperature Checks.

What would China do?

I imagine by now they would have tracked down all the people that have been to ""Life Care"" (Oxymoron) nursing home in Washington USA and Lynn Valley nursing home in North Vancouver, Canada (been there seen that). No word on if USA and Canada have done that yet???

Also no word from investigative journalists interviewing ""health care professionals"" on if they travel between nursing homes because they are ""specialists""?

Finally on Saturday March 14, 2020 Apple closed all it's stores outside of China and reopened them inside China. I visited West Edmonton Mall and sure enough the store was closed with 4 blue t-shirt clad employees outside closed doors and I said ""So it's true"" (what Tim Cook said). Investigative journalists be asking themselves what Tech companies knew before their governments did. Look how Facebook and Google closed down events a week or fortnight before your governments did. Ask yourself the 5W's and sometimes how?



March 17, 2020

Happy St. Patrick's Day. Plans to go out tonight got cancelled because Alberta declared a state of emergency.

Guy at work was sent home for coughing because ""it's not safe"". Unemployment will cover a percentage of his wage if he gets tested positive for Covid-19 but you can't see a doctor if you are coughing. Viscous circle / Catch 22.

USA announce 1 trillion in ""juice"" for the economy. I used my ""Big Number Calculator"" and it tells me ""1T / 300M"" = 3K. That will tie an average person over for a month.

Some or many people will be traumatized after a few months of Cabin Fever and never fly again, take a cruise again or trust a stranger again. A crime wave unknown in recent memory could sweep across NATO countries of diversity.

Hit 30k on this answer :(

"I would like to know if it has been proven or disproven that the Coronavirus/COVID-19 can be spread via public toilet seats?

I am thinking that perhaps I should always carry around hand sanitizer with me and put some on each public toilet seat that I use. I would put it on some toilet paper and then rub down the toilet seat before sitting down.
","The virus causing COVID-19 infects the respiratory tract. It is spread in droplets of moisture when an infected person sneezes, coughs, and exhales. These droplets can be inhaled directly and can also end up on surfaces, where they can be picked up on your hands and then spread to your face.

The WHO recommends hand washing and avoiding touching your face with unwashed hands as the primary ways to protect against infection.

Could a toilet seat potentially transfer the virus? Perhaps, but there is nothing special about a toilet compared to other surfaces in a bathroom, and there are no recommendations to treat that surface in particular. The way that you would transfer virus from those surfaces would be by touching them with your hands and then touching your face. The WHO recommends hand washing to combat this.

"Coronavirus death rates are higher for people in the range of 80+ (14,8%) and 70-79 years old (3,6%). However, there are countries, specially in Africa, where life expectancies are in the 50-60 and 60-70 years old range. Some people (like Bill Gates) warned about possible catastrophes if the virus massively reachs Africa. Could it happen than the lower life expectancy of those countries prevents more people from dying? Is people who lives 60 years old in countries with lower life expectancy, expected to have the mortality rates for Coronavirus of the people of the same age in countries with higher life expectancy, or a person of 60 years old in countries like those is in a physical state of an older person in a more developed country and as such have a higher mortality rate? 
","Age is a red herring, only a secondary characteristic correlating to death rates.

It's people that are already seriously ill or already have weak immune systems that are most likely to die soon after contracting Covid-19.  And it's when people are clustered in a close community that they are most likely to contract the disease.

In our society, the people in those circumstances tend to be old and in health-care facilities.
As a result, most of our deaths so far have involved people over 80 years old.

In other societies, a lack of old people doesn't necessarily mean a lack people living in close quarters, that are weak or sick.

There's certainly no shortage of such conditions in many parts of Africa.

"In our choir, we are discussing measures to slow the spread of the novel Coronavirus in our community. However, I lack understanding about how the virus spreads in a closed room. The German Public Health authority recommends ""Social distancing"" of 1-2m.

However, in a choir, many people are singing all the time on the same location. Singing also produce respiratory droplets [src1] and I don't know how long those droplets stay infective. 


[src1] states that droplets dry out within 2m. Are Coronaviruses only infective while suspended in these droplets?
Given the long exposition of the people to each other and the long duration of singing, are the recommendations of Social Distancing applicable to choirs?

","I don't understand any choir being compatible with any definition of social distancing.  If the German Govt is asking you to practice social distancing it means meeting another person at a distance.  You can not continue your choir.


  What is social distancing?
  
  Social distancing measures are steps you can take to reduce the social interaction between people. This will help reduce the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19).
  
  They are:
  
  Avoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). These symptoms include high temperature and/or new and continuous cough
  
  Avoid non-essential use of public transport, varying your travel times to avoid rush hour, when possible
  
  Work from home, where possible. Your employer should support you to do this. Please refer to employer guidance for more information
  
  Avoid large gatherings, and gatherings in smaller public spaces such as pubs, cinemas, restaurants, theatres, bars, clubs

"Nowadays we are hearing Angela Merkel with a specialist and a doctor in United States claiming Covid-19 could infect betweeen 50-70% of the population. According to this CDC FAQ flu infects between 3% to 15% of people each year. So I was wondering if recently we got any disease with such large contagious rate as claimed by Merkel, and yesterday in argentine television a doctor said they made a research in Argentina and they got to the conclusion that back in 2009 Influenza A H1N1 infected 60% of the argentine population but many of them didnt develop symptoms. Is this possible? 
Is it possible that H1N1 infected 60% of the population back in 2009 in a country? Is there any other data which could back this up?
","your question is related with mine:

We will never know how many individuals have been infected, we can only count the cases that have been diagnosed and these are those who are died or have been hospitalized or have visited the doctor.

So it could be possible that 80 % of a population is infected but only 50% are diagnosed and as we had also a medial hype in 2009 it is really surprising that the spread trend of H1N1 2009 in Argentina was so low:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic_by_country

I don't know where from Merkel has her information ...

"Recently, German Chancellor Angela Merkel gave a speech about the importance of slowing down Covid-19. Among her remarks were


  The most important thing, the chancellor said, is to slow down the spread of the coronavirus to win time for people to develop immunity


How does that work? Can immunity be developed without actually catching the disease or via a vaccine?
","It's hard to know exactly what another person is thinking, but Merkel is probably referencing herd immunity.

Assuming that people who are infected and recover will be less susceptible to infection in the future (the extent to which is currently unknown), those people have effectively been naturally vaccinated, which can help slow down future spread.

"As of time of writing it's quite common to see headlines about so-and-so who have tested positive for Covid-19, e.g. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau's wife, Sophie, tests positive for coronavirus, officials say

However, these articles don't usually say how reliable the testing is. I couldn't find any recent information on it via Google, either (there are some results, e.g. this, but they are old).

How accurate are the tests? What are the odds that Sophie Trudeau's results are a false positive, or that Justin Trudeau's negative result is a false negative?
","Short answer: Sophie Trudeau's positive test may still mean 3 : 1 odds of not having contracted Covid-19, but the odds could also be far more towards having Covid-19.
Justin Trudeau's negative test almost certainly means he was negative when tested. Of course, should Sophie be positive, that may have changed by now.



Update: I found a web page of the FDA listing tests that have this Emergency Use Approval. Each of them has manufacturer instuctions that list their test results towards the end. Some of the submitted test results use ≈100 negative samples in the clinical evaluation. But there is also one that has only 13 positive cases (all of which were correctly found) in their test - but that one got the emergency approval already early in February.
The latest 2 (by Thermo and Roche) used 60/60 and 50/100 cases for their clinical evaluation (all results correct). That gets the lower end of the confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity to 94 - 97 % (with the lower end of the c.i. we'd thus have LR+ >≈ 20 or 17, expected values would be 61 or 51, respectively. For LR- &lt;≈ 1/20 or 1/32 (expected 1/61 or 1/100). 



Long version: Let's do some number juggling and see whether we can extract something useful. The following calculations are based on a somewhat worst-case scenario: the FDA emergency validation guidelines specify outcomes that such a new test in the current emergency situation must meet, and I calculate from the low end of performance that could be expected meet these criteria under somewhat unlucky circumstances.

So we know minimum performance requirements, but I do not know [yet] how good (= how much better than minimum performance) the tests are.

Sensitivity and Specificity

The starting point would be sensitivity and specificity of the respective test.  I haven't found any published data on these, but the FDA has a Policy for Diagnostics Testing for Coronavirus Disease-2019 that says how labs that develop a test should do an ""emergency validation"". They can then get Emergency Use Approval.  


Sensitivity tells us: of all truly Covid-19-positive specimen, which percentage is correctly recognized as positive by the test; I'm going to use  87.5 % (see below)
Specificity tells us: of all specimen that are truly negative for Covid-19, which percentage is correctly recognized by the test.


Sensitivity and specificity can be measured by standardized protocols, and they characterize the performance of the test. 

From a patient's or doctor's point of view, however, they are not very useful numbers as they (we) need the answer to the inverse questions:

Predictive values


positive predictive value PPV: given that the test yielded positive, what is the probability that the patient truly has the virus?
negative predictive value NPV: given that the test yielded negative, what is the probability that the patient truly does not have the virus?


Predictive values can be calculated from sensitivity and specificity together with the prevalence (or, as we are talking about newly infected patients, the incidence) of virus among the tested population. Here's how they go for the assumed sensitivity and specificity:


red for positive test outcomes, dark green for negative test outcomes. posterior probability = after the test said something, what is the probability that the test result is correct = NPV for negative test result, PPV for positive test result.

Good estimates of prevalence are often difficult to obtain, because we need the prevalence among those who are tested and that is (and should be) quite different from the prevalence of the disease in the general population. 

For some countries such as Italy, we have numbers of performed tests (Wiki page giving numbers for more countries): as of today (March 14th), they ran 109170 tests and have a total of 21157 cases. Not all tests are for initial diagnosis (AFAIK, a patient is considered cured only after a bunch of tests are negative), but as most cases are still ""fresh"", we may the ratio positive cases : tests run as one surrogate for the prevalence in the tested population. This would be around 20 % for Italy. 

From the diagram we can then read for a new patient being tested the first time:


if the test outcome is positive, chances are ≈ 75 % (or greater as I'm calcluating with the lower end of the possible range from the emergency validation) that the patient really has Covid-19.
So, up to 25 % false positives. 
if the test outcome is negative, chances are ≈ 95 % (or greater...) that the patient really does not have Covid-19.
So, up to 5 % false negatives. 


Canada currently reports 25 positive out of a total of 796 tests, so about 3 % prevalence in the tested population.

For the USA, the CDC reports case numbers and test numbers, currently 1629 cases with (3995 + 15749) tests - but it is not entirely clear to me whether the populations completely coincide. Anyways, I'll use 8 % as guesstimate for prevalence.

| prevalence |  PPV |    NPV | Country/Population | 
+------------+------+--------+--------------------+
| 3 %        | 26 % | 99.6 % | Canada             |
| 8-9 % (?)  | 50 % | 98.8 % | USA, Germany       |
| 20 %       | 75 % | 95   % | Italy              |



Now that is the population of ""everyone who is tested"". At least for Germany (March 14th) but probably also for Canada and the US, tests are done on people who show symptoms and on people that are known to have had contact with Corona virus cases: if they are found to be positive, they are sent home to quarantine and wait whether they did acutally catch the disease. But we may still say that the ""people who are tested"" population has subpopulations with and without symptoms.
So if there are further point of suspicion, say, the patient does cough, we'd say they belong to a high risk subpopulation with higher prevalence of Covid-19 compared to the overall prevalence among tested, so the chance of a false positive would be lower for them.  

This will change as tests are performed only on people who show symptoms (by now, March 16th, everyone is already  told to stay at home in Germany and self-isolate as well as possible - the test result will not change this in any way).  

Handy for quick calculation: likelihood ratio positive (LR+) and negative (LR-)

If we express the prevalence as odds (1 : 99 instead of 1 %), LR+ and LR- allow easy back-of-the envelope calculations. 

LR+ = sensitivity / (1 - specificity) ≈ 11 or better for our test and 
LR- = (1 - sensitivity) / specificity ≈ 0.05 = 1/20 or better for our test.

so they are indpendent of the prevalence and they tell us how the odds change due to the test: the posterior probability (predictive values) are the the pre-test odds multiplied with the likelihood ratio. In that sense, they tell us how much information we gain due to test (for positive and negative outcomes).

So, Canada reported odds of 25 positive : 771 negative tests. So for Sophie Trudeau, the odds went from 25 : 771 (or 3 %) to  25 : 771 * 11 = 273 : 771 ≈ 1 : 3 or 25 %. For Justin Trudeau 25 : 771 / 20 = 25 : 15420 ≈ 1 : 617 or 0.16 % of being Covid-19 positive (slight discrepancy to above due to rounding).

On the other hand, if we start testing more and more people for whom the risk of actcually having contracted the virus is lower and lower, we soon won't be able to draw meaningful conclusions from the test results any more: I'm in Germany, currently the federal info page lists 3800 confirmed cases. Even if we assume that there is a huge dark figure and in reality 20 x as many people are infected* that would be a prevalence in the general population of 0.1 %, the odds are 1 infected : 1.5 mio non-infected. If someone who does not belong to any particular risk group were tested positive, their odds would increase by factor 11, i.e. roughly 1 : 140000. A negative test result would decrease the odds by a factor of 1/20 to 1 : 31 mio. However, both results are of no practical use as they don't change the situation: pre-test situation is ""very unlikely to be Covid-19 case"", post-test situation is still ""very unlikely to be Covid-19 case"".

This is why, even if there were testing capacities for the whole population, tests don't make sense unless we know there are some risk factors such as some kind of respiratory disease or contact to someone who is known to have the virus. And why it is sensible to say that on slightly suspicious circumstances (= low, but not extremely low prevalence), one should self-quarantine/avoid contact but there's no point in testing [yet].



Detais on how I estimate sensitivity and specificity


The lab first determines the limit of detection (LoD) for virus RNA. The LoD here is the lowest concentration at which 19 out of 20 replicate tests are positive (that would be 95 % sensitivity, but for samples spiked in the lab, but with a relevant and as difficult as possible matrix such as sputum). 
Next, [leftover] clinical samples are used: 


As there may not be any positive samples available, the lab can spike negative samples with virus RNA; a minimum of 20 samples are spiked within a range of 1 - 2 LoD plus 10 samples to cover the remaining clinical range.
Of these, at most 1 is allowed to have negative outcome (and that must be one in the lower concentration range). Thus, 29 positive out of 30 true positive. 
Also 30 non-reactive specimens are tested. The policy doesn't say a number of false positives that is permissible, so I'm going to assume that must be zero.  

The lab can then start with real patient samples. The first 5 positive and the first 5 negative cases must be confirmed by an approved test (and must all match). 


Pooling the 2 ""rounds"" of testing clinical samples, we have:


34 (or 35) positive tests out of 35 truly positive specimen -> sensitivity at least 97 % with 95% credible interval 87.5 - 100 %,
specficity 100 % with 95% credible interval 92 - 100 %
There are additional checks required but they don't help us here.
Sampling errors are not included in this validation.
I'm not a clinical chemist, but I'm analytical chemist and in general analytical chemistry, that can easily be the dominating source of error. In that case, the above numbers would be useless.
Particularly the sensitivity may drop over time as the virus mutates. 
To deal with this, in some cases multiple tests are done (read that in some newspaper article which I don't find at the moment).
When doing multiple tests, tests by different providers are used if possible: as they are developed from different virus samples, this gives a better coverage for mutations in the virus than doing the same test in replicate.




* Very handwavy scenario I derived from the development of case numbers in China after their quarantine/shutdown on Jan 26, assuming an incubation period of 2 weeks and that noone got infected after quarantine started.
"
"For context, Australia, where I live, currently sits at ~130 confirmed cases, which makes me feel relatively safe for now, but naturally this will get worse with time as other countries' examples suggest. I will be working from home, avoiding public transport and limiting shopping to the minimum. I live in suburban Sydney, so one of the major population centers.

How safe is it to continue solo outdoors training with the current and predicted COVID-19 situation? Specifically, I mean cycling without a group (i.e. maintaining a good degree of separation from any other humans at any given time). I imagine it has to be considerably safer than e.g. grocery shopping. Can the virus remain airborne outdoors for long periods of time?
","The long and short of it is that the novel coronavirus can be experimentally aerosolized where it can persist in the air for several hours but a number of studies have failed to detect virus in samples taken from the air of the rooms of patients with active disease.  But virus has been detected in aerosols near bathrooms surfaces indicates that it is spread over a long distance with mechanical assistance (flushing?).  SARS was also spread by one patient with diarhoea with malfunctioning sewer systems aerolized the virus across multiple floors of a building.


  Both the Covid-19 and the SARS viruses had an aerosol half-life of 2.7 hours, meaning half the particles drop out of the air after that amount of time, and half of what remains drop out after another 2.7 hours. After a day, roughly nine half-lives, 0.002 (0.2 of 1%) of the original particles remain. As a result, the scientists said, “aerosol … transmission of [the new coronavirus] is plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours.”


The usual spread may be via contaminated surfaces (probably on the cruise ships) and respiratory transmission less so since the rate of symptomatic infection among a patient’s household members was 10.5%

Since you're outside based on the above, the viral load would be miniscule.

"I have been hearing a lot of people say that it is recommended to wash your hands thoroughly in order to maximise protection against COVID-19 infection. I also heard that the washing hands rumours are just a way to make people believe that they are protecting themselves and that the washing hands thing is actually not backed up by real data. 

Question:  


  Is washing hands really that useful? And if yes, is there any data backed up to defend this?


The reason i'm asking this is because an expert in this field said that the ""data is very week behind this"" and ""it's not going to have a big impact on preventing infection"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw) 43:32 and that the data behind the virus being infected through the eyes is very sparse (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw) 44:00
","Here's an article that I found helpful, to understand why washing hands with soap is so helpful, and how it helps (Pall Thordarson is a professor of chemistry at the University of New South Wales, Sydney):


  Why does soap work so well on the Sars-CoV-2, the coronavirus and
  indeed most viruses? The short story: because the virus is a
  self-assembled nanoparticle in which the weakest link is the lipid
  (fatty) bilayer. Soap dissolves the fat membrane and the virus falls
  apart like a house of cards and dies – or rather, we should say it
  becomes inactive as viruses aren’t really alive.
  
  The slightly longer story is that most viruses consist of three key
  building blocks: ribonucleic acid (RNA), proteins and lipids. A
  virus-infected cell makes lots of these building blocks, which then
  spontaneously self-assemble to form the virus. Critically, there are
  no strong covalent bonds holding these units together, which means you
  do not necessarily need harsh chemicals to split those units apart.
  When an infected cell dies, all these new viruses escape and go on to
  infect other cells. Some end up also in the airways of lungs.
  
  When you cough, or especially when you sneeze, tiny droplets from the
  airways can fly up to 10 metres. The larger ones are thought to be the
  main coronavirus carriers and they can go at least two metres.
  
  These tiny droplets end on surfaces and often dry out quickly. But the
  viruses remain active. Human skin is an ideal surface for a virus. It
  is “organic” and the proteins and fatty acids in the dead cells on the
  surface interact with the virus.
  
  When you touch, say, a steel surface with a virus particle on it, it
  will stick to your skin and hence get transferred on to your hands. If
  you then touch your face, especially your eyes, nostrils or mouth, you
  can get infected. And it turns out that most people touch their face
  once every two to five minutes.
  
  Washing the virus off with water alone might work. But water is not
  good at competing with the strong, glue-like interactions between the
  skin and the virus. Water isn’t enough.
  
  Soapy water is totally different. Soap contains fat-like substances
  known as amphiphiles, some of which are structurally very similar to
  the lipids in the virus membrane. The soap molecules “compete” with
  the lipids in the virus membrane. This is more or less how soap also
  removes normal dirt from the skin.
  
  The soap not only loosens the “glue” between the virus and the skin
  but also the Velcro-like interactions that hold the proteins, lipids
  and RNA in the virus together.
  
  Alcohol-based products, which pretty much includes all “disinfectant”
  products, contain a high-percentage alcohol solution (typically 60-80%
  ethanol) and kill viruses in a similar fashion. But soap is better
  because you only need a fairly small amount of soapy water, which,
  with rubbing, covers your entire hand easily. Whereas you need to
  literally soak the virus in ethanol for a brief moment, and wipes or
  rubbing a gel on the hands does not guarantee that you soak every
  corner of the skin on your hands effectively enough.
  
  So, soap is the best, but do please use alcohol-based sanitiser when
  soap is not handy or practical.

"I have been reading about the spread of virus and understand comparisons that are being made with the flu.  The flu propagates through a population with vaccinated people while a new virus has an unvaccinated population.  I would like to understand the limitations of using data from the flu and making inferences to dealing with Covid19 given their populations are fundamentally different.

When you look at how contagious a virus is they talk about transmission rates without indicating if the rate is the base rate or the effective rate.  The flu and Covid19 have similar base rates, however 40% of the US population is vaccinated from the flu.  Does that mean that the flu actually has a much higher transmission rate in un-vaccinated people and the average works out to a number similar to Covid19 in an unvaccinated population?  Or does in mean that vaccine doesn't stop the spread as much as it really stops the disease?
","Reproduction numbers

First of all, the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) refers to the contageous person meeting susceptible people only:  the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. So $R_0$ is not affected by vaccination status (or acquired immunity) of the population, but it includes factors such as being contageous already during incubation period (i.e. while still free of symptoms, how contageous a single virus particle is, how long a virus particle lasts under ""normal"" circumstances, ...)

In contrast, the effective reproduction number R includes the effects of vaccination, acquired immunity, behaviour and other measures to reduce infection risk.

The wiki page linked above lists $R_0$ for Covid-19 as 1.4–3.9 and for the Spanish flu of 1918 as 2–3.

Now, for the countries that still have just a few Covid-19 cases and that are just beginning to take measures to slow the spread, the effective reproduction number will be roughly the same as the basic reproduction number: noone is immune yet, and no measures to reduce the number of contacts yet. 


  Does that mean that the flu actually has a much higher transmission rate in un-vaccinated people and the average works out to a number similar to Covid19 in an unvaccinated population?


Sort-of, but rather the other way round: it means that the effective reproduction number is lower for the flu even though their $R_0$s are similar. 

This review paper gives an R of about 1.8 for the 1918 flu and about 1.3 for the ""normal"" seasonal flu.



Vaccination


  Or does in mean that vaccine doesn't stop the spread as much as it really stops the disease?


That can also happen. Of course, the best and intended outcome of vaccination is that the acquired immunity is sufficient to prevent infection. Which means that the vaccinated person cannot spread the disease. However, not all vaccinatione we have and use achieve this - we still use them if they greatly reduce the severity of the disease. E.g. even with varicella vaccination 10 - 30 % of the exposed to get chickenpox (but even with them, serious disease is avoided). 

For the flu, the difficulty is that new strains appear regularly. This is also the reason why flu vaccination is done annually with a newly developed vaccine while e.g. for MMRV, pertussis, polio boosting with the existing vaccine every 10 years is sufficient (immunity actually may last even longer, up to lifelong*, but that varies by person, and since many vaccines haven't been around that long, we don't know for which that is the case).  In fact, flu strains appear so often that the development of the annual flu vaccine includes educated guesses which strains are going to be important for next season. Sometimes that guess is off. Wikipedia on flu vaccination has a table giving  effectiveness (actual reduction of infection risk) between 10 - 60 % for different years.
Even if the acquired immunity by vaccination is for the wrong strain, one may still benefit from cross-immunity(?) in that the disease will be milder and possibly shorter.



* also acquired immunity after a disesase does not always last life-long, e.g. a pertussis infection will achieve immunity for 4 - 20 years only (4 - 12 years for vaccination)

"I found the there is a project Folding@home to fight against COVID-19. As far as I understand, it uses huge amount of computing power to find a cure. Why do we need such a huge number of potential candidates for compounds? I have understood that the limiting thing when developing drugs is the clinical tests, and one research team can't do really many tests in a day. So why don't researchers just use a normal laptop and run some simulation program which says that next one should test the following candidates? Or have I understood wrongly how the distributed computing or super computers helps on medicine? It sound really weird if researchers has so accurate heuristics that simulations can say that this candidate looks more promising as that one.
","For the COVID-19 coronavirus, the first step of infection occurs in the lungs, when a protein on the surface of the virus binds to a receptor protein on a lung cell. This viral protein is called the spike protein (Wrapp, et al. 2020), and the receptor is known as ACE2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2).

Before proteins can do their work, they need to assemble themselves. This self-assembly is what is called ""folding"" and there are many, many different ways proteins can fold.

An antibody is a type of folded protein that can block the spike protein from binding to its receptor, therefore preventing the virus from infecting the lung cell.


  Folding refers to the way human protein folds in the cells that make up your body. We rely on the proteins to keep us healthy and they assemble themselves by folding. But when they misfold, there can be serious consequences to a person’s health. (Source: Folding@home Homepage)


You asked


  So why don't researchers just use a normal laptop and run some simulation program which says that next one should test the following candidates?


Testing protein folding permutations takes a huge amount of computer power. Using the network of computers using the Folding@home app, they are combining the power of all the connected computers at once to work out the protein sequence as quickly as possible.


  We can build computational models that accomplish this goal, but it takes a lot of computing power.
  
  This is where you come in! With many computers working towards the same goal, we aim to help develop a therapeutic remedy as quickly as possible (Source: Folding@home COVID-19 page).


One protein from 2019-nCoV, a protease encoded by the viral RNA, has already been crystallized (See: Worldwide Protein Data Bank).


  Although the 2019-nCoV spike protein of interest has not yet been resolved bound to ACE2, our objective is to use the homologous structure of the SARS-CoV spike protein to identify therapeutic antibody targets (Source: Folding@home COVID-19 page).

"There is a public figure/writer on the Internet which plays a sort of ""informal journalist"", who stated in a tweet (without a source), that ""Italy is hit hard, experts say, because they have the oldest population in Europe.""

Now this can be interpreted in two ways. That death rates are higher because of this (it makes sense), or that the disease is spread faster because of this. Could this last idea be true?

Is an old population a contributing factor for the spread of the disease, or does the disease infect younger and older populations in the same way?
","There are some theories that the COVID-19 outbreak started in hospitals (VOX, March 13, 2020):


  Another theory is that intense spread of the virus in the hospital
  system, before doctors realized there was a problem, may have
  amplified the outbreak. Some 10 percent of medical workers in Lombardy
  have been infected, according to a March 3 Washington Post report, and
  health workers account for 5 percent of those infected in the country.


In hospitals, in general, there are more older people.

There were also several cases of quick spread of infection in nursing homes.

Hospitals and nursing homes are environments where people live close together, so this is why infection can spread quickly among older people.

Younger people get infected in schools, when they travel to areas with lot of infected people and when they engage in contact sports, for example.

One of the reasons for a lot of cases in Italy is that they didn't act quickly when the inefction started.
"
"For example: during the current covid 19 outbreak the reported numbers are number of infections after various measures like social distancing or quarantine have been used - so it doesn't make much sense to compare it to the r0 if a disease like flu, where similar measures aren't used.

Is there an objective measurement?
Something like what are the chances of getting infected in some controlled conditions
","R0 is the basic reproduction number describing how many cases are expected to be infected by a single case. This value is not a biological constant.


  With an R0 (reproduction number) estimated at 2.5 (based on China), many experts predict that between 20 and 60% of the world population could get infected (which means at least 0.5M deaths).
  
  However, the R0 varies during the course of an epidemic as a result of a series of determinants and interventions


such as containment and mitigation factors, and eventually herd immunity and vaccination.

"The COVID-19 virus causes respiratory illnesses. The virus does so by changing the generic code of our cell.

If a virus can cause a change in our body, like respiratory illness, can the same techniques in a controlled manner be used in a constructive manner, for example treating cancer.

Simply if I ask, can we create a virus like a thing to work for good in our body, just like nuclear fusion used for bombs and electricity.
","I think the claim about viruses always being destructive isn't a good starting assumption for a question. For several reasons:


In the sense that OP is probably considering, it isn't true. Counterexample, see below (and there are also other uses we put viruses to).
In a wider sense, life is always destructive in that a living organism uses energy, substances, and space that otherwise could be used by another living organism. While we could debate whether viruses are alive or not, they certainly share these points.
So a bacteriophage (see below) may be destructive to the bacterium it infects. But that bacterium dying means the ""neighbor strain"" that is resistant against this phage is thriving. So one organism's destruction eases the life of other organisms.
In that sense, I consider the claim of desctructivity with ""so, what?""





  can we create a virus like a thing to work for good in our body


Have a look at bacteriophages and phage therapy.
Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria, and there has been research about using them against bacterial infections about 100 years ago, in parallel to the development of antibiotics. 

Besides political/language difficulties (bacteriophage research was strong in the Soviet Union, and in consquence lots of the research publications are in Russian) back then antibiotics turned out to be easier and cheaper in practice (this may change with increasing antibiotic resistances, though).

Antibiotics are produced by chemical synthesis or isolation from plant/fungi. They are chemical substances, so once we have studies that show that the stuff works as intended, product testing ""only"" needs to show that the correct modification of the correct substances is there in the correct concentration.  

But the viruses are more-or-less alive, and in any case they evolve. So chemical substance testing is not sufficient, for each batch the biological activity must be checked and proved anew. This means a lot of expensive work for each batch of the virus.
Also, the bacteriophages are pretty much the opposite of a broad-spectrum antibiotic: they are not only species specific but also strain specfic (I don't know whether that is the case always, often, or sufficiently often to hinder practical application). 
"
"The way countries and people fighting COVID-19 these days is by quarantine so no one get infected and stop spreading the virus.

This method slow down the spread of the virus

We know that COVID-19 is easily transmitted virus, it can be transmitted by beath, touch, etc.

in the other hand HIV is more serious and have been for more 40 years and can be trasmitted sexually or blood transfusion..

HIV can be controlled easier.

Why HIV wasn't stopped using the quarantine method to stop it from the begining ?

and why not trying to contaminate the virus now and stop it by using same methods used for COVID-19?
","Someone who's been infected by COVID-19 is asymptomatic but can spread the disease for no more than 14 days.  Quarantine measures were started in China less than two months after the first case.

Someone who's been infected with HIV can be asymptomatic but capable of spreading the disease for 20 years or more.  Further, the outbreak started sometime between 1910 and 1959, but wasn't identified as a disease until 1981.

Given the long asymptomatic period of HIV and the even longer delay in identifying it as a disease, it's pretty much impossible to stop it by quarantine.
"
"Could one be injected with an infinitesimal amount of Covid-19 viral particles, in a way that it would trigger an immune response long enough before the virus overran the body? Could it be injected into tissue that was far enough away from the lungs, so that some immunity could build up before the virus reached the lungs?

I am talking about something similar to variolation, which was a method used to control the spread of smallpox. Material from smallpox sores (pustules) was given to people who had never had smallpox. This was done either by scratching the material into the arm or inhaling it through the nose.

People usually went on to develop the symptoms associated with smallpox. However, fewer people died than if they had acquired smallpox naturally.
","What you're describing is a live-virus vaccine.  The only live-virus vaccines ever used were the early smallpox vaccines, which carried a significant risk of causing the disease rather than building immunity.  Even attenuated vaccines (using a live but weakened form of the virus) can cause disease; most cases of polio these days are caused by the oral polio vaccine.  Vaccines using inactivated viruses or virus fragments are strongly preferred.
"
"I had symptoms that could have been corona symptoms last week. Unfortunately the testing capacity in my country (Germany) is not sufficient to test every person with symptoms at the moment, so only people who had verified contact can be tested, which I didn't.
It would be very useful, though, to know in hindsight whether I had it, since this would probably make me immune and thus make me much more flexible. For example I could help old or infected people without having to fear infecting them or me.

So is there or will there be a way to test later on whether I had it or not? Or will I never be able to know?
","China has been using antibody testing to see if people had been exposed in their convalescent phase. The USA didn't want to do antibody testing and have wanted to recover virus using a PCR test, but PCR won't show historical infection.  Open source antibody tests have been described but presumably will need to wait for FDA/CDC approval ( https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-blood-test-antibodies.html https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037713v1 ).

There's no guarantee that infection with one strain gives protection against other strains, nor that immunity is going to be long lasting.

"Can the US increase its capacity for COVID-19 testing fast enough to accomplish simultaneously:

1) slowing the spread of disease to allow hospitals to provide care for the infected, and

2) minimizing the impact on the economy by allowing social distancing measures to be relaxed (e.g. reopening schools and restaurants)?

Is there a testing strategy that can accomplish this and what kind of resources would it require?

See a related question here.

EDIT: The ACLA expects US labs to be able to do 280,000 tests per week by April 1st (acla.com). What if the full weight of the federal government was behind this ramp-up in capability?

EDIT2: Tom Frieden recently wrote (vox.com) that ""testing is not a panacea,"" but he goes on to say that


  ""testing is absolutely, crucially important ...in areas with few or no cases, to inform containment and isolation strategies and facilitate contact tracing. Seattle would likely have had a much smaller outbreak if testing there had been widely available sooner.""


The containment strategy right now seems to be evolving toward one in which the entire country is on lockdown. Could we do more targeted (but equally effective) containment if we had a clearer picture of where the virus was? Note: Conversely, Frieden warns against widespread testing in areas of confirmed community transmission.
","Well, I'm no epidemiologist and have neither the required data nor their simulation tools at hand. However:

While testing is of course needed, I doubt that more testing can compensate for lack of distancing now. 

Also, there is Japan with social distancing but low numbers of tests with slow curve, and South Korea does not only test but also practice social distancing.
There are also countries with lots of tests / inhabitant and heavy increases, Italy for example.



How are screening tests different from what is done now.

(Slight disclaimer: I'm in Germany, so I know most details about the strategy here. AFAIK, it isn't that different in the US, though. At least, also here people are complaining that they get tests refused and people are talking that test capacities are not unlimited - but it's not clear to me whether people are sent home who should be tested according to a doctor ordering that test or only those who go/drive to the test centers because they think they should be tested.)

What is done right now in most countries (including Italy, Germany, South Korea) is testing populations that are at a non-negligible risk of having contracted the virus. Looking at the current (Mar 19) numbers of positive tests among all tests (Germany) and using LR+ of better than 20  (below in parentheses)and expected 61 and LR- of better than 1/20 (below in parentheses), expected 1/61 (see long explanation here)

            | pos tests/tests | PPV         | 1-NPV
------------+-----------------+-------------+------------------
USA         |          11   % | 88 % (72 %) |  0.2  % (0.6  %) 
Germany     |           3.9 % |
South Korea |           2.8 % | 64 % (36 %) |  0.05 % (0.01 %) 


PPV = probability of having SARS-CoV-2 after the test was positive
1-NPV = probability of having SARS-CoV-2 after the test was negative  

(There's the implicit assumption that everyone is tested with that same test - which is not true, the South Koreans by now may have better validation data, but I don't know this)

Screening means testing the normal population, which (still) has much lower prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Assuming the dark number is 99 x the known case count (i.e. we have 100x as many infected as positive test results),

            | 100*cases/inhabitants | PPV            | 1-NPV
------------+-----------------------+----------------+------------------
low risk    | 1 in 10000 =   0.01 % | 0.6 % ( 0.2 %) | &lt;0.01 %
USA         |                0.36 % | 18  % ( 6.7 %) |  0.2  % (0.6  %) 
South Korea |                1.6  % | 50  % (25   %) |  0.05 % (0.01 %) 
Germany     |                2.0  % | 54    (28   %) |  0.03 % (0.1  %)
Germany*    |                0.4  % | 20  % ( 7.4 %) | &lt;0.01 % (0.02 %) 


With that assumed large dark numbers, Germany and South Korea would both have prevalences by now where using the existing test on the general population would start to make sense, as that would mean only 1 false positive case per true positive case. On the other hand, with prevalence in the single digit percent we'd be in the region where Frieden argues that testing of the general population doesn't make sense because it makes more sense to tell people to stay at home and away from contacts (which is the case for Germany - and since the numbers aren't growing as fast in South Korea, their dark number is probably much lower). 

In the low risk population (where Frieden says testing would make sense), we'd have only correct 1 out of about 200 positive cases. The PPV is for many practical considerations too low: screening needs very good tests, with very high sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity, because it is crucial here not to overlook truly positive cases, and specificity because the true positives  are otherwise hidden in army of false positives. 

To some extent, it is often possible to trade in some sensitivity for speificity and vice versa, e.g. with HIV test for blood donors, we do exactly this: we choose a very high sensitivity (so we can be sure not to infect anyone), and accept low specificity. So low, that a blood donor with positive HIV test isn't even told that they were tested positive. Instead, another test is applied (preferably by another manufacturer, because that adds more information than duplicate testing with the same kit), and if that is still positive, yet another one (a more elaborate one). After that IIRC it is still more probable that the blood donor does not have HIV, but they's be looking into it and taking anothe blood sample. 
(And the decision for the donated blood is anyways to throw it away just to be on the safe side). 

In principle we could do the same for SARS-CoV-2. Chaining lab tests would mean an enormous burden to the health system of dealing with false positives (and possibly re-testing people) at a time where we don't have unlimited health resources and where the probability that the false positive anyways catches the virus next day or so is non-negligible. This makes this strategy that starts from testing low risk population a complete waste of ressources (even if we had unlimited capacity for testing). This may change in the future when we have tests where proper full validation has shown that they have very good specificity and a useful sensitivity.

What we do currently, isn't very different though in principle:
We do currently chain two independent tests, just that the lab test comes 2nd: first a doctor comes and tests whether you are high risk group because you had contact with confirmed cases (maybe even 2nd order contacts) or you show symptoms. Then comes the lab test. 

Now the Germany* line in the table above is an interesting additional point. The prevalence there is from the influenza sentinel data from week 11 (last week). These are samples collected from people who were not sent to SARS-CoV-2 tests, but who went to a doctor with flu-like symptoms. 1 out of 251 was SARS-CoV-2 positive (and also influenza positive). The practically important point is: what did we miss because that SARS-CoV-2 case was overlooked (or would have been, had they not been in the sentinel sampling)? Actually, nothing: someone with the flu is told to stay at home and not infect anyone else pretty much like someone with SARS-CoV-2 (particularly now since it would also relieve the health system if the seasonal influenza would be overcome a bit faster). 

Testing in areas with few infections

Frieden does not propose screening, though: he proposes testing people who have been in contact with infected ones. Which apparently did not work out in Seattle, from what I read due to a lack of tests - but it did work out in Germany where it allowed to completely stop the first (small) outbreak in January.

Here, the ""had (2nd order) contact to infected person"" is the first test in the chain. This is a containment strategy, not a delay strategy. 

In order for this to work, we need a two ""ingredients"": we must be able to trace the contacts (and better also 2nd order contacts), and people sent to quarantine must obey this quarantine. 

Comparison Germany - South Korea (mainly)

... the US is left as excercise to the informed reader


South Korea apparently makes extensive use of autamated tracing of people in a fashion that would be completely unconstitutional in Germany.  
South Korea does use social distancing: according to Wikipedia they also shut down kindergardens, schools, and universities postponed their semester start. It did not have quite the same impact on overall economy that we see in Germany now. Their shutdown apparently was not all over the country, but earlier: they did that when they had 1000 cases.  
Apparently the population did a whole lot of that volountarily: the wiki page says the streets of Daegu were empty on Feb 20 (when they had a total of 100 cases).
In contrast, Germany now has 15 k cases, and pretty much an official shutdown since the weekend in terms of kindergardens/schools/universities, pubs/clubs/... and apparently there is a sizeable sub-population that gives in to the urgent need of having their own big (!) parties since pubs are closed.
(I can only speak from what I read in the news, I live in rural Germany where my sports clubs canceled everything - but the neighbors had a 4 generation party (not that many people, but...) for their new house yesterday. (OTOH, we have 8.5 confirmed cases per 100k inhabitants here, so even with that factor 100 for dark number, we're still below 1 % prevalence now) 
What seems to be similar: in South Korea young adults are the ones who spread the virus. Similar in Germany (more middle-aged initially [those who can afford to make skiing holidays in the Alps], now the Corona-Parties are a young adult thing)
I believe East Asia is in general more on the alert than we were. MERS and SARS are cited as reasons, but of course overall high population density also means a permanently increased risk of infectious disesases.
The Wiki page about COVID-19 in South Korea indicates similar testing capacity for South Korea (10k tests/day; 51 mio inhabitants) and Germany (16k tests/day; 80 mio inhabitants)


Some countries with more or less flat curves and more or less testing (per mio inhabitants):


South Korea so far done about 6000 tests / mio inhabitants
Italy 7300 / mio (maybe a bit late, but the main thing that was late in Italy is that for a while they didn't realize they had SARS-CoV-2)
Japan only 117/mio - but they have a very slow growth, still less than 1000 cases and their curve is decidedly flattening. Japan distances socially since Feb 25th (incl. e.g. to stay at home and not go to a doctor with only mild cold-like symptoms) at 167 cases in the whole country.
Singapore practices certain measures of social distancing since late January when they had &lt; 10 cases. (Didn't find testing numbers, though)
Norway has 6440 tests/mio inhabitants. Hopeful look at curve suggests that a slight flattening may take place. They started their lockdown at ≈700 cases, a bit more than a week ago.
Germany has ≈2100 tests/mio. 100 k tests were done in week 11, current capacity is about 30 k tests/day (is currently ramping up).
(substantial flattening at the earliest expected in about 2 weeks)
USA: according to Wikipedia 300 / mio inhabitants, but the German newspaper cites 3.5x as many tests, that would be 1100 / mio inhabitants.
(The difference may be whether private lab tests are counted or not?)


The Dutch test

... is about antibodies whereas the other tests look for virus RNA. These tests again good for different things:


The Dutch test tells whether there has been sufficient exposure to the virus (and sufficient time thereafter) to build antibodies. (Once we know more about this, it may also tell whether one is immune against SARS-CoV-2)
As they say, this is also important for getting an idea about the dark numbers of people who have been infected, but had so mild symptoms they didn't realize it.
The other tests tell whether you currently have the virus (and are contagious). 
Screening for active cases needs this test - the more so as the antibody test may become positive only a while after one is already contagious. 


Simulitis

The Washington Post has simulations of the spread of a (easier, more basic) disease called simulitis with 4 scenarios, ranging from no measures at all over a not quite perfect quarantine to moderate and extensive social distancing (25 % and 10  % of the population run around as always, rest stays where they are). I highly recommend reading, but here are some runs I just did:



Brown are active cases, violet cured/immune and blue susceptible persons.

Important findig for this question: in the first part of the quarantine simulation, the quarantine worked an noone got out (1st hump). Note that this hump has roughly the same height as the moderate social distancing hump, and leaky quarantine is worse (though the simulation doesn't get any newly infected into a new quarantine - I'd say the quarantine situation may be less like real quarantine and more like totally closed borders vs. not-quite-free movement between two countries).

"This Science Daily article states that steroids could do more harm than good in treating coronavirus (COVID-19), referring to this The Lancet article. 


  Understanding the evidence for harm or benefit from corticosteroids in
  2019-nCoV is of immediate clinical importance.


It's unclear to me how exactly the use of corticosteroids (which is a common treatments for Asthma patients) can do harm other than the vague explanation of ""steroids also impair the immune system's ability to fight viruses"". 

How exactly does the use of steroids harm the body in case of fighting a virus such as SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) that causes COVID-19?
","One of the primary purposes of corticosteroids is to suppress immune activity and inflammation: that's exactly why they are used in asthma.

Of course the immune system has an actual job besides causing nuisance inflammation: fighting infection.

For some infections, the harm to the infected person caused by the immune reaction itself is worse than that of the pathogen itself, so steroids can help prevent damage or ease symptoms while the immune system continues to mount a response, without being hyperactive.

For others, immune suppression may be detrimental. 

Corticosteroids mediate the immune response by suppressing a variety of cytokines and increasing others, which influences activity circulating numbers of different immune cell populations. Cortisol binds the glucocorticoid receptor, causing numerous changes in gene expression, many of which are associated with the immune system. From Wikipedia:


  (cortisol) inhibits production of interleukin (IL)-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IFN-alpha, and tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-alpha by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T helper (Th)1 cells, but upregulates IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 by Th2 cells. This results in a shift toward a Th2 immune response rather than general immunosuppression. The activation of the stress system (and resulting increase in cortisol and Th2 shift) seen during an infection is believed to be a protective mechanism which prevents an over-activation of the inflammatory response.


In other words, corticosteroids work by by suppressing the generalized killing/cleanup part of the immune system mediated by macrophages and CD8+ cells, while preserving the B-cell part of the immune system that produces specific antibodies and the neutrophils that phagocytose antibody- and complement-bound pathogens.

Immune reactions are incredibly complex, so some of these basics may be violated in certain circumstances (including prolonged rather than acute dosing), and I've left out a lot of the other related immune cells. See references below (and the Wikipedia pages linked above) for more:

"Two academic hospitals in The Netherlands (Nijmegen and Utrecht) just got approval to experiment with using a tuberculosis vaccine (BCG) to try to better protect hospital workers against coronavirus.

I assume that ""protect hospital workers"" means something like decreasing the severity of the infection.

Apparently the BCG vaccine is known to stimulate the immune system. Given that information, how exactly will it ""protect hospital workers""? With or without BCG vaccine, the immune system does not yet have the antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) coronavirus. So, will the immune system, after BCG vaccination, create more or better antibodies or generate them faster? 

https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2020/03/will-tb-vaccine-help-healthcare-workers-fight-corona-dutch-hospitals-experiment/
","BCG vaccination appears to enhance the humoral response to general infection. There is said to be also enhanced response so therefore protection against influenza. The trial above is to see if it helps with a response against sars-cov-2.


  There is some evidence that BCG vaccination enhances the humoral immune response to other unrelated childhood vaccinations, essentially acting as an adjuvant. Ota et al. reported that infants vaccinated at birth with BCG had, upon vaccination against hepatitis, significantly higher levels of IgG against hepatitis B vaccine antigens. Furthermore, BCG vaccination given at the time of oral polio vaccine boosting improved the antibody response to polio, indicating an effect of BCG at the systemic level (154). An Australian study of 56 BCG-vaccinated and 52 non-BCG vaccinated infants found that BCG vaccination was associated with significantly higher IgG titers against pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antigens, H.influenzae type b polysaccharide and tetanus toxoid following routine immunisations later in infancy

Thanks.
","You should read the whole article:  

Things You Should Never Microwave

The problem with microwaves is that they are not heating any item put inside them homogeneously but create ""hot spots"" instead. The image shows a simulation of the electric field inside a microwave oven (taken from wikipedia).
Therefore, microwave oven have a turning table and still it is advisable to stir your food in between of the heating process. 
A paper or cloth, however, could catch fire!



The better idea to clean cloth is obviously a washing machine. Those usually have also a program to wash at 60°C / 140°Fahrenheit, which should be sufficient, or even higher. This will not only kill most germs (denaturation of many proteins or nucleic acids starts already below 50°C) but also wash away contamination.

"From different sources we hear that a coronavirus vaccine might be ready in weeks / April / 3 months, but that they would require testing and mass production and it won't be ready to use until 12/18 months. For example, this website states,

Human trials for a coronavirus vaccine could begin ‘within a few weeks


  Human trials testing a potential vaccine to prevent COVID-19 could
  begin “within a few weeks” with a vaccine ready for public use within
  the next 12 to 18 months, a top U.S. health official said.


But according to,

2009 flu pandemic vaccine


  After a meeting with the WHO on 14 May 2009, pharmaceutical companies
  said they were ready to begin making a swine flu vaccine


and 


  As of September 2009 a vaccine for H1N1/09 was expected to be
  available starting in November 2009, with production of three billion

  65 million doses of vaccine had been administered and that it had a
  similar safety profile to the seasonal flu vaccine, with no
  significant differences in the adverse events produced by the
  different types of vaccine


Why it's said a coronavirus vaccine wont be ready for using in 12-18 months when for the H1N1 2009 outbreak there were vaccines available in 6 months?
","Sorry this is a cut and paste answer from https://pharma.elsevier.com/pharma-rd/approaches-for-creating-a-covid-19-vaccine/


  Before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, no one had ever heard of the causative agent 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2). There were no approved antivirals or vaccines for this virus or for any related coronaviruses (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus).
  
  Problems with COVID-19 vaccine development
  
  Developing vaccines from scratch—which is required for COVID-19—is typically not a good option for stopping an ongoing pandemic. The extensive time required to develop a safe and effective vaccine that can prevent future disease in vaccine recipients (average of approximately 10 years) [1] means that the public health threat will end long before a candidate vaccine is licensed.
  
  Vaccine development requires extensive planning regarding vaccine design, vaccine production and purification, preclinical testing in animals (to ensure some safety in humans), and multiple phases of clinical trials in humans (phase 1 for safety and phases 2 and 3 for efficacy). Companies taking the risk and proceeding with vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 (at least 13 companies as of March 7, 2020) [2] are banking on the virus continuously circulating, so they have a population to conduct phase 2 and 3 trials with. If the virus disappears from circulation in China—or the perceived risk the virus poses to human health substantially declines—before phase 2 trials end, vaccine development will probably end.
  
  Vaccine design approaches
  
  Vaccines that are safe and stimulate the right immune responses that confer protection from disease are challenging to design. There are a number of different strategies companies have used: live attenuated or inactivated viruses, virus-like particles or other protein-based approaches, viral vector–­based vaccines or nucleic acid–based vaccines. Of the potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the pipeline, four involve nonreplicating viruses or protein constructs, four have nucleic acid–based designs, two contain live attenuated viruses and one involves a viral vector [2]. Regarding the previous SARS pandemic, one inactivated SARS-CoV [3] and one DNA-based vaccine [4] made it through phase 1 trials before vaccine development ended.
  
  The different approaches for vaccine design all carry different advantages and disadvantages [5]. Approaches involving replicating viruses stimulate robust immune responses, but safety is often a concern. Protein vaccines and nucleic acid–based vaccines are often safer but typically have less immunogenicity, and they require adjustments to induce stronger immune responses. Nucleic acid–based vaccines are typically the fastest to get into phase 1 studies, but no nucleic acid vaccine has been licensed for use in humans as of yet.
  
  Because of safety concerns involving older populations (who have higher risk for severe disease), using a live attenuated virus might not be the best approach [6]. Patients with severe disease typically have T-helper 2 responses (immune responses typically induced against extracellular parasites), so vaccines known to elicit this type of immune response (inactivated viruses, virus vectors) might also be best avoided. Vaccines involving protein-based (virus protein subunits, virus-like particles, nanoparticles) or nucleic acid–based (DNA or RNA encoding virus structural proteins) designs, which do not have known safety disadvantages, might be the best approaches for SARS-CoV-2.
  
  Unfortunately, our knowledge of the immune response is not advanced enough for us to accurately predict vaccine safety and efficacy. What we have to do (testing multiple different strategies) is exactly what is being done. Only with results from more extensive research will we know the absolute best approaches for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. 


Furthermore experts have said that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is heavily glycosalated so that potential immune epitopes are hidden from the immune system.
"
"There are several aggregate central trackers for the spread of COVID-19. Like this one, for example.

Is there anything similar for trials? Or trials in the pipeline? Either vaccines or treatments?

"Many countries have instructed their elderly population to stay at home because of COVID-19. Young people like myself are starting to volunteer to help deliver food and other supplies.

But given asymptomatic transmission and virus spread from contact with contaminated surfaces, how I can make sure I don't accidentally do more harm than good?

Is it enough to use hand sanitizer before I go to the store, then again use hand sanitizer when I unload the grocery bags from my car, and make sure I keep several meters of space between me and the person I deliver to? Should I wear a mask? Gloves?

I'm guessing most older people will want to pay in cash. Is it possible to decontaminate change (coins, bills), or is it safer to only accept exact payment?
","The official position of the WHO is that main mechanism of disease transmission is by droplet infection onto mucosal surfaces, or, transfer of those droplets by hand to those surfaces.  There is also data to suggest aerosols are generated in close proximity to infected people by coughing or mechanical means such as toilet flushing but we do not know how viable the virus is when spread in that way.

Hand sanitizer and washing is primarily before eating to stop that virus transfer.

If you're visiting someone whom you don't know, then you need some PPE as a mask and goggles in case they cough directly in close proximity to you.  If you can't buy this, then there are DIY recipes to make masks and plastic shields.

You can spray the outside packaging with a bleach solution to sterilize it if there's a possibility that it was contaminated at source, or the recipient can do that.

I'd suggest you use a non-contact form of payment, such as WeChat, or whatever else is available.  Avoid handling of cash/coins.

"If I understand it right, the following steps are to be taken into account:


Taking the sample. -for the proposed method more samples would have to be taken.
Transporting the sample -more samples would have to be transported.
Testing -more material, would have to be tested, but less individual tests would have to be made.


So it seems, that 4 sub-questions can to be considdered to help answere.


What is the bottle neck in the testign process?
Does the amount of material needed to test for COVID-19 scale rather with the number of performed tests, or with the amount of tested material?
Does the amount of time needed to test for COVID-19 scale rather with the number of performed tests, or with the amount of tested material?
Is the the nucleic acid amplification test still reliable enough, if the Virus RNA to be detected is dilluded among multiple samples?


So far I have read a rather general account on how the tests are conducted https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2020/03/18/how-testing-for-covid-19-works.html
And I think I have a somewhat crude undersanding of how NAAT works.
","Update Apr 2: Pooled tests are under development now (newspaper in German), the plan is to pool 5 samples and to use the usual amount of each sample (and presumably dilute less) so that sensitivity is not an issue. 



In general, pooled tests help in screening situations, that is, when very few samples are positive, so that 10+ samples can be pooled and still only a small fraction of pooled samples is positive. They require good sensitivity.  

We're not in a screening situation with the current SARS-CoV-2 testing, and pooling wouldn't help much right now - it would probably not be worth while the effort to develop and implment pooled tests. 



Long version:

(update: deleted newspaper hints that logistics may be the bottleneck:)


  What is the bottle neck in the testign process?


According to Kekulé (10 min or so into the interview) the ""lab machinery"" in Germany has a capacity of several 100k tests per day, but right now there are shortages in reagents but also e.g. in the swabs for taking samples (so, comparably low tech parts of the test). Pooled tests of course need just as many swabs (if not more: false negatives due to the sampling not picking up virus material is a concern, and the usual remedy is to take more swabs.)



Anything that comes now are my guesses as a professional from a neighbouring field: analytical chemistry). I don't have any first hand experience with PCR. 


  Does the amount of material needed to test for COVID-19 scale rather with the number of performed tests, or with the amount of tested material?


I expect the reagent needs to scale (mostly) with the number of performed tests. I also expect the amount of tested material to be the same (prescribed by the method/protocol) for each run. That is, when you pool n samples, you'd take only 1/n of material from each (In practice it may be better to pool and then take out 1/n of the pooled sample).  Update: The test described in the newspaper goes the opposite direction: they take n times the sample material in order to avoid trouble with low sensitivity. In consequence, this cannot be considered a ""derived"" ""variety"" of the 1-sample tests, it must be newly developed almost from scratch.


  Does the amount of time needed to test for COVID-19 scale rather with the number of performed tests, or with the amount of tested material?


Again: the tests, mor precisely the number of batches of tests since multiple tests can be processed in parallel. 


  Is the the nucleic acid amplification test still reliable enough, if the Virus RNA to be detected is dilluded among multiple samples?


(From here on, we're back inside my professional experience)

This I cannot answer since I don't know the typical concentration range of virus RNA in the samples of positive cases.  

The lowest concentration of virus RNA that can reliably be detected is called the limit of detection (LoD). In this context, reliably is 19 out of 20 validation samples at that concentration according to the emergency/""shortcut"" validation procedure of the FDA (I expect other parts of the world to have similar validation procedures right now). The rFDA has a page with tests that have this emergency approval](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#covid19ivd), and the Manufacturer information lists the LoD. 

One would relate the lower end of the typical concentration range to the LoD to calculate how many samples could be pooled without the test becoming unreliable. 
The linked news article hints that this may actually be a limiting factor. The test under development avoids this problem by using more sample material.



There's another limitation to how many samples one can sensibly pool. The aim of the procedure is to save tests. Thus, we need to set up the pooling so that only a small proportion of pooled tests is positive and a large fraction of cases can be ""closed"" as negative. 

Here's the fraction of pooled samples that is positive depending on the prevalence = fraction of positive samples and the number of samples that are pooled n:

  

Contours are every 10 %points. Dashed and dotted lines are the current fractions of positive samples for Germany and Italy.

From that, we can calculate how many samples we need to run (for every positive pooled sample, additional n tests) and from that the fraction of tests we save compared to testing each sample separately:



Contours here are right to left: 0, 25 %, 50 % and 75 % ""savings"".

So, at the current testing situation in Germany, pooling 4 samples would allow to save almost 60 % of tests. In Italy, pooling 3 samples would save less than 15 % of tests.

A pooled test would need its own validation and one would also do some additional development to get the required sensitivity (LoD) for the desired number of pooled samples, meaning more delay until pooled tests would be available. 

In addition, pooled tests alongside the single tests that are anyways needed would mean additional logistic burden in the labs.  

I don't think developing a pooled test would be worth while right now, the more so, as other measures would give similar or better relief:

Doing only 1 test per household would save about 50 % since the average size of a household in Germany is 2 without the need of any new test development.

The same is true for further concentrating the tests on the vulnerable/high risk population. 

Thus, pooled tests may help in the containment phase when they'd allow to test a larger number of possible contacts. 

Update: Getting back into containment phase is the aim of the current lockdown. 

We'd still have high requirements for sensitivity and specificity. This means, pooled tests would have helped most right at the beginning of the epidemic - but they always mean additional R&amp;D and also additional validation needs to be done (and part of the validation work btw. must be done in every single lab that wants to use the test) since they need to be implemented in addition to the single sample method. This means, they'll always be available only after the single sample method is established.

"Pictures of people clad in white protective gear, looking like SciFy and sparying streets, offices, factories and people have emerged in the media.

What are they spraying and is there any evidence it will help stop or slow the spread of the disease?

Making such large quantities of disinfectant must be costly, still the practice seems wide-spread especially in Asia. So there must be some assumed benefit, but is there any real evidence it helps?
","I don't know but they're likely spraying bleach to kill virus on surfaces.  Studies show the virus can persist for days on stainless steel etc, but we don't have good data how much of any of this can cause further infection.

It does help to impress on the public the need to keep washing which is the most effective way to be safe apart from complete isolation.

"One of the most commonly used masks/recommended to protect against COVID-19 is N95. 

Is there any upside of using N95 masks instead of N99 or N100 to protect against COVID-19?

N95 which filter 95% of particulates, while N99 or N100 filter 99% and 99.97%, respectively.

For example:


  Health officials recommend medical staff wear so-called N95 masks because they filter out about 95% of all liquid or airborne particles.


The N95 equivalent in Europe is FFP2, the N99/100 equivalent in Europe is FFP3, and the N95 equivalent in South Korea is KF94.



Prior research:

https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus


  Infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, MD, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells Health that the N95 is still the recommended face mask for health professionals, because it has the capacity to filter out very small particles that could possibly contain the virus. “This is different than a surgical mask, which can only stop larger droplets,” says Dr. Adalja.


http://emag.medicalexpo.com/which-masks-actually-protect-against-coronavirus/


  In the United States, respirators must meet NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) standards. Within this standard, there are several classes of respirators depending on the degree of oil resistance:
  
  Class N: no oil resistance. A distinction is made between N95, N99 and N100. The number after the letter indicates the percentage of filtration of suspended particles


https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-face-masks-not-entirely-effective-2020-1


  When worn correctly, N95 respirators block out at least 95% of small airborne particles. So the respirators can filter out some droplets carrying coronavirus. The coronavirus itself measures between .05 and 0.2 microns in diameter, according to a recent article in The Lancet.




I have cross-posted the question at:


Quora
Reddit

","Yes, there are several ""upsides"" as you put it. 


It's cheaper
It's easier to breath in
It's sufficient for catching particles smaller than it's actually designed for...


Now, that last point is what's important. According to 3M's own documentes on various types of filters and masks, it seem that there's an electrostatic effect between the layers of the filters and the particles hitting it. So:


filter ""grid"" does not have to be smaller than the particles themselves
Apparently because of the electrostatic effects, particles are attracted to - and prefer to stick to, the fibers of the filter. 


From [2]:


  Because of the various mechanisms by which particulate filtration occurs, the smallest particles are typically not the most difficult to filter. Most particulate filters have a region of lower filtration efficiency somewhere between 0.05-0.5 μm.1 Particles in this range are large enough to be less effectively pushed around by diffusion, but small enough to be less effectively captured by interception or impaction. The most penetrating particle size (MPPS) will depend on the filter media, air flow, and electrostatic charge on the particle. Filters that use electrostatic attraction may have a MPPS shifted to a slightly smaller size range.

"Information about (simple) mask wearing (concerning covid19) is a complete mystery to me. On several official places it is not recommended for a person without symptoms to wear a mask. For example: 

https://youtu.be/Ded_AxFfJoQ
(time 0:20)

or here:

https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/should-i-wear-a-mask-to-protect-against-the-coronavirus

However no explanation is given - which makes me wonder (and even angry). I think everybody should wear a mask because:


Many persons feel ashamed wearing it, even those with symptoms. If everybody wears it, they do not feel ashamed and wear it.
As far as I know, one is (wrt covid19) contagious before developing symptoms. So if everybody wears the mask also these people do.


The two above points act as a collective protection.


Simple mask certainly will lower ""getting / spreading illness"" probability. Of course the ""holes"" (in a simple mask) are too big to prevent completely virus to enter (or get out when coughing), but it lowers probability! Even if it lowers the transmission probability by e.g. 5%, it might be a lot. As a hypothetical example: it might reduce R0 from 1.02 to 0.97 and so stop the virus spread so fast.

time 0:50 the lady says I should wear a mask if I am in contact with an infected person... why if it is inefficient?

Question: What are reasons for not recommending wearing a mask?
","TL;DR: please WEAR A MASK!

(unless your nearby hospitals are out of it, in which case give your masks  to them and stay at home)



The link you mentioned provides the reason that the CDC likely has in mind (though I agree it doesn't identify it clearly as the reason):


  The worldwide supply of masks is limited. It's critical that we use them appropriately. [i.e., prioritizing them for high-risk people].


Thought the CDC is now considering recommending general public wear face coverings in public.

{1} compiled different government guidelines on the use of mask. You'll see that some of them do recommend wearing a mask whereas others such as the UK mentions that ""there is very little evidence of widespread benefit for members of the public"". Some governments such as the South Korean 
government even distribute free respiratory masks (2 KF94 per person per week in South Korea).

"If I read Figure 2 of … the impact of influenza on excess mortality … correctly, the excess mortality due to flu
in Italy during the peak weeks of the flu epidemic of 2016–2017 was about 800 deaths/day.  This is way more than what is happening 
with Covid-19 now.  How come the health system is so stressed now?

Is it due to geographical distribution (Lombardy!) which Italy could not compensate by moving resources?  Or is it a different
distribution of deaths vs. being in intensive care?  Or what?
","The big difference in Italy today is that many younger, otherwise healthier patients need critical care and more generally that patients need critical care for a long time. These patients are not necessarily dying after they get care, but the extent to which the surviving patients require ventilators and supplemental oxygen is nothing like a seasonal flu and is likely inflating the death rate substantially among those who could otherwise be treated.

From NEJM: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005492


  Contributing to the resource scarcity is the prolonged intubation many of these patients require as they recover from pneumonia — often 15 to 20 days of mechanical ventilation, with several hours spent in the prone position and then, typically, a very slow weaning. In the midst of the outbreak’s peak in northern Italy, as physicians struggled to wean patients off ventilators while others developed severe respiratory decompensation, hospitals had to lower the age cutoff — from 80 to 75 at one hospital, for instance.

","The best data we have from Guangdong, China, is that household transmission is not 100%


  preliminary studies ongoing in Guangdong estimate the secondary attack rate in households ranges from 3-10%.


So, this suggests that if either of you are potentially infected, then social distancing and other infection control measures will likely prevent the transmission from one to the other.

If, on the other hand, you have all been tested to be infection free (PCR or other reliable test), and you are in isolation without the risk of catching the infection from someone else, then as adults what you do in the privacy of your own homes is only limited by local laws and imagination.

"According to Wikipedia :- 


  ...Although the cause is unknown, the underlying mechanism involves an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves and damages their myelin insulation. Sometimes this immune dysfunction is triggered by an infection or, less commonly by surgery and rarely by vaccination. The diagnosis is usually made based on the signs and symptoms, through the exclusion of alternative causes... 


Can the SARS-CoV-2, which causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, cause GB syndrome? 
There's evidence that the Zika virus, H1N1 and few other viruses can cause GB Syndrome. Is there any possibility or evidence that the said coronavirus can trigger this autoimmune disease? 
","
  Like everything else, we're instructed by past experiences. Although there weren't a lot of data on neurologic aspects of MERS and SARS, there were some papers describing neurologic complications in those patients. In rare cases, complications including ADEM (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis)-like demyelination, encephalitis, and brainstem encephalitis were reported. They also saw some peripheral and non–central nervous system stuff, including things that looked like Guillain-Barré syndrome or what they would sometimes call critical illness polyneuropathy

"Let's say 15 minutes after a person coughs or sneezes, where does the droplet go? Up in the air and down to the ground? Is it different inside a building?
","Data suggests droplets remain in the air up to 3 hours, and longer for droplet nuclei.  Where they go depends on the local temperatures, humidity and air flows.



The image shows a cough on the left and a sneeze on the right.  


  Currently, the term droplet is often taken to refer to droplets >5 μm in diameter that fall rapidly to the ground under gravity, and therefore are transmitted only over a limited distance (e.g. ≤1 m). In contrast, the term droplet nuclei refers to droplets ≤5 μm in diameter that can remain suspended in air for significant periods of time, allowing them to be transmitted over distances >1 m (Stetzenbach, Buttner &amp; Cruz, 2004; Wong &amp; Leung, 2004). Other studies suggest slightly different definitions, with ranges for “large” droplets, “small” droplets and droplet nuclei being >60 μm in diameter, ≤60 μm in diameter and &lt;10 μm in diameter, respectively (Tang et al., 2006; Xie et al., 2007). The concept is that the naturally and artificially produced aerosols will contain a range of droplet sizes, whose motion will depend significantly on various environmental factors, such as gravity, the direction and strength of local airflows, temperature and relative humidity (which will affect both the size and mass of the droplet due to evaporation).


Oops, breathing and talking can produce droplets yet health authorities continue to claim that masks are not needed (to stop wearers from broadcasting droplets into the environment)


  Humans can produce respiratory aerosols (droplets) by several means, including breathing, talking, coughing (Figure C.1, A), sneezing (Figure C.1, B) and even singing (Wong, 2003; Toth et al., 2004).


We are being told that the main droplets are the larger ones being emitted but talking for 5 mins can produce droplet nuclei the same as a cough


  Published data have suggested that sneezing may produce as many as 40 000 droplets between 0.5–12 μm in diameter (Cole &amp; Cook, 1998; Tang et al., 2006) that may be expelled at speeds up to 100 m/s (Wells, 1955; Cole &amp; Cook, 1998), whereas coughing may produce up to 3000 droplet nuclei, about the same number as talking for five minutes (Cole &amp; Cook, 1998; Fitzgerald &amp; Haas, 2005; Tang et al., 2006). Despite the variety in size, large droplets comprise most of the total volume of expelled respiratory droplets. Further data on the behaviour of droplet dispersion in naturally generated aerosols are needed.


Small droplets fall to the ground where they dry up before they reach the ground but some become droplet nuclei on their way down which allows them to remain airborne


  In the classic study of airborne transmission, Wells (1934) was able to identify the difference between disease transmission via large droplets and by airborne routes. Wells found that, under normal air conditions, droplets smaller than 100 μm in diameter would completely dry out before falling approximately 2 m to the ground. This finding allowed the establishment of the theory of droplets and droplet nuclei transmission depending on the size of the infected droplet. The Wells evaporation-falling curve of droplets (see Figure C.2) is important in understanding airborne transmission and transmission by large droplets. Wells' study also demonstrated that droplets could transform into droplet nuclei by evaporation.


And what happens to droplet nuclei


  Droplet nuclei floating on the air may be carried by the movement of air. Entrainment of air into neighbouring airspaces may occur during the most innocuous daily activities; for example, as a result of people walking, or the opening of a door between a room and the adjacent corridor or space (Hayden et al., 1998; Edge, Paterson &amp; Settles, 2005; Tang et al., 2005, 2006). In addition, the air temperature (and therefore air density) differences across an open doorway will also cause air exchange to occur between the two areas, providing a second mechanism to allow air into other areas (Tang et al., 2005, 2006) (see Figure C.3).

"This is an exploratory question.

If a COVID-19 infected person (person is unaware that he is infected) milks the cow for couple of days, is there a possibility of him infecting the cow thereby infecting the milk?

Similarly, if a dog licks the face of COVID-19 infected person, is it possible that the virus may spread through its saliva to another person in the vicinity.

Covid-19 is the result of a zoonotic outbreak from bats to an intermediate ( and unidentified host ) thence to humans.  It is thought that bats don't suffer the disease themselves as they carry low levels of virus but the intermediate host modifies the virus, and amplifies it so that it vastly increases the amount of virus that can shed into the environment infecting humans.  One possible scenario is that bat coronavirus combined with a fish coronavirus inside the intermediate host.  This is based on the observation that the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene shares a 39-base insertion with a type of soldierfish that swims in the South China Sea.

The SARS-CoV-2 infects humans via the ACE2 surface receptor, but this receptor is not only found in humans.  Other animals have similar but not exactly the same ACE2 receptors and several dogs and one cat have returned positive swabs for SARS-CoV-2.  The cat developed covid-19 symptoms.  The first dog died two days after being released back to its owner but that might have been from the stress of quarantine in a 17 year old Pomeranian.  Ferrets also have an ACE2 receptor which also binds strongly to the SARS virus so presumably are also at risk. Mice appear to be less at risk.


  This is the first human-to-cat transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). About a week after its owner got sick with COVID-19, after returning from a trip to Northern Italy, the cat developed coronavirus symptoms: diarrhea, vomiting and respiratory issues, Steven Van Gucht, virologist and federal spokesperson for the coronavirus epidemic in Belgium, told Live Science.
  
  The owner sent samples of vomit and feces to Dr. Daniel Desmecht's lab at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Liège. Genetic tests showed high levels of SARS-CoV-2 in those samples, he said. ""The cat recovered after 9 days,"" Van Gucht said.


The Hong Kong Govt is now asking that pets of infected patients must now be quarantined for 14 days.

The CDC gives the following advice (which is out of date based on the above):


  If you are sick with COVID-19 (either suspected or confirmed), you should restrict contact with pets and other animals, just like you would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. This can help ensure both you and your animals stay healthy.
  
  When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. Avoid contact with your pet including, petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with them. For more information visit: What to Do if You are Sick.


We don't have information on cows but presume that they may also be susceptible.

EDIT: Experimental data suggests cats are more susceptible to the virus than dogs


  The team, led by virologist Bu Zhigao, infected five domestic cats with SARS-CoV-2 through the nose. When two of the cats were euthanized six days later, the researchers found viral RNA, as well as infectious virus particles, in their upper respiratory tracts.
  
  The other three infected cats were put in cages next to three uninfected felines. The team later detected viral RNA in one of the non-infected cats, which suggests that they contracted the virus from the infected cats through respiratory droplets. All four cats also produced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in cats should be considered as part of efforts to eliminate COVID-19 in humans, the authors note in the preprint, which has not been peer reviewed.


and


  Dogs, however, were less susceptible to the virus. The researchers infected five young dogs and found that two excreted viral RNA in faeces, but none contained infectious virus.
  
  Similar investigations in pigs, chickens and ducks identified no viral RNA in animals deliberately infected with the virus, or those exposed to the infected animals

"I would like to have a confusing part of medicine cleared up. My experience of medical intervention is as follows.


As pointed out in the answer to Does taking antibiotics make you immune to virus? antibiotics do not work on viruses.
If I go to a doctor when suffering from the common cold, I am told to ride it out and take paracetamol for aches and pains. That makes sense as the common cold is caused by a virus.
If visiting the doctor because a chest infection arises however, a course of antibiotics is often prescribed.


How does a doctor manage to determine that the chest infection is a bacterial infection rather than a viral infection from the common cold virus?

If the bacterial infection arose out of a common cold infection, why is it the bacterial infection occurred and not a viral infection?
","This is actually a pretty complicated question because viral infections can damage the lungs in a way that makes subsequent bacterial infections possible/likely and it's often these that are fatal. So if co-occurring both may need to be treated, with different medications, or the viral infection may be ignored sometimes. It basically depends on the severity of the pneumonia (which I'm guessing it's what you mean by ""chest infection""). For some background on causes of pneumonia:


  Pneumonia is an infection of the lung that causes the alveoli, or air sacs, to fill up with fluid or pus. [...]  If pneumonia does not resolve it can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and decreased pulmonary function.
  
  There are several viral infections that lead to pneumonia (16). Influenza A virus (IAV) primarily infects the lung epithelium, and can cause viral pneumonia. [...] There are also a variety of other viruses that can infect the lower respiratory tract and lead to pneumonia, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, human metapneumonia, and some adenoviruses (14, 18–22). Rhinoviruses and newly described coronaviruses also infect the respiratory tract and cause disease. [...]
  
  A variety of bacteria can also lead to the development of pneumonia. Bacterial pathogens as well as opportunistic infections (also known as pathobionts) can lead to pneumonia when allowed to infect the lower respiratory region. Bacteria that cause LRTIs naturally colonize the nasopharynx, but can cause disease when allowed to proliferate in the lower respiratory region (24–28). The most common examples of these are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Other bacteria are acquired from the environment, and often these bacteria have specific virulence factors that allow for the adaptation and infection of the lower respiratory tract (29). [...]
  
  The vast majority of research in infection biology has been devoted to studying the interactions of a single pathogen with a host. In addition to single infections causing pneumonia, a common complication following infection with respiratory viruses is bacterial pneumonia (9, 26, 39–56).Many clinical infections and presumably subclinical infections are often in fact coinfections, in that two (or more) pathogens simultaneously or in close temporal proximity infect a single host (9, 26, 39–59). These infections are termed secondary infection, superinfection, or coinfection. The simultaneous response of two pathogens can manifest in many ways and often results in increased morbidity and mortality. 
  
  To determine the best treatment options for patients with complex viral/bacterial coinfections increased understanding of the interplay between pathogens and the interaction with the host is necessary. Several viruses and bacteria have been shown to interact to worsen clinical outcomes. It is now believed that most of the deaths associated with the 1918 influenza pandemic were caused by superinfection with bacteria (60, 61). IAV/S. pneumoniae coinfection is perhaps the most well-studied example of viral/bacterial coinfection of the lung (62). However, bacterial coinfection also complicates infection with other respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, metapneumonovirus, RSV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and coronavirus (52, 63–66). Young children are especially vulnerable to bacterial complications following viral infection (44, 62, 67, 68).


So the NICE (i.e. UK) guidelines for diagnosing pneumonia say for example:


  Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a lower respiratory tract infection most commonly caused by bacteria; however, viruses are thought to cause approximately 13% of cases in adults, and approximately 66% of cases in children and young people. The main bacterial pathogen causing CAP is Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Haemophilus influenzae; epidemics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae occur approximately every 4 years in the UK, and mainly affect children.
  
  Inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections is common in general practice. [...]


So if you are an adult suffering from pneumonia (the Covid-19 pandemic aside) chances are you more likely you have bacterial pneumonia.


  NG120 also emphasises the importance of face-to-face clinical examination in patients with acute cough if prescription of an antibiotic is being considered. Clinicians should therefore avoid issuing antibiotics for cough without a face-to-face examination. If bacterial pneumonia is suspected, it is important to assess the clinical signs and to determine their severity. [...]
  
  An antibiotic should be offered within 4 hours of establishing a diagnosis of pneumonia, and a 5-day course is considered appropriate in all severity gradings.


Also worth quoting from those guidelines:


  In practice, patients often return at the end of the antibiotic course due to concerns that symptoms have not resolved; however, in pneumonia, we should not expect symptom resolution at this stage. When issuing an antibiotic, it is important to explain to patients that their symptoms are highly unlikely to have resolved at the end of the course, but that the infection will have been adequately treated. It may be helpful to bear in mind that chest X-rays are not expected to return to normal for up to 6 weeks after pneumonia, reflecting the ongoing inflammatory rather than infective process.
  
  Sputum samples do not need to be routinely sent for patients with CAP treated in primary care. However, they can be useful if signs or symptoms have not improved as expected after antibiotic treatment, or in people who have previously had frequent courses of antibiotics, as this increases the likelihood of resistant organisms.


Basically, unless the pneumonia is severe enough (to require hospitalization), you won't get a test to determine the agent that caused it, unless the first course antibiotic doesn't resolve it.

I can tell you from general experience that the cause of pneumonia will get tested in severe cases in a hospital setting in almost any country. (There are probably some WHO guidelines for this, but I can't be bothered to search them now.)

Short coda on Covid-19:


  A study of 191 patients in two Wuhan hospitals showed that 50 percent of those who died tested positive for secondary infections compared to only one of the 137 survivors. In this situation, antibiotics form a crucial second line of defence. Many studies indicate that nearly all severe COVID-19 patients will receive antibiotics. 

"
"Presuming that we were able to find a person who was never exposed to any of the human seasonal coronaviruses (part of the viruses that cause the common cold), would the virus be just as deadly for that person as the SARS-CoV-2 currently circulating around the world? Or is SARS-CoV-2  uniquely dangerous?
","The seasonal coronaviruses attach exclusively to cells with a ciliated epithelium.  


  Coronaviruses invade the respiratory tract via the nose. After an incubation period of about 3 days, they cause the symptoms of a common cold, including nasal obstruction, sneezing, runny nose, and occasionally cough (Figs. 60-1 and 60-2). The disease resolves in a few days, during which virus is shed in nasal secretions. There is some evidence that the respiratory coronaviruses can cause disease of the lower airways but it is unlikely that this is due to direct invasion. Other manifestations of disease such as multiple sclerosis have been attributed to these viruses but the evidence is not clear-cut.
  
  Studies in both organ cultures and human volunteers show that coronaviruses are extremely fastidious and grow only in differentiated respiratory epithelial cells. Infected cells become vacuolated, show damaged cilia, and may form syncytia. Cell damage triggers the production of inflammatory mediators, which increase nasal secretion and cause local inflammation and swelling. These responses in turn stimulate sneezing, obstruct the airway, and raise the temperature of the mucosa.


So, the mechanism of infection is such that they only attack the upper airways.

The SARS-CoV-2 is totally different.  It attaches to the ACE2 surface receptor which is found deep in aleolar pneumocytes.  Their damage causes loss of surfactant in the alveloi, the collapse of these air cells that perform oxygen exchange and subsequently ARDS.

So, seasonal coronaviruses give you a runny nose but don't kill.  SARS-Cov-2 collapses your air cells so you don't have any oxygen.

Mentions


  Take these steps to monitor your health while you stay home and practice social distancing:
  
  Stay home, except to get medical care. Get rest and drink plenty of fluids.


...


  
  Get rest and drink plenty of water or clear liquids. Avoid alcohol or drinks with caffeine, such as sodas, tea, and coffee.
  


...

Why?

Why to avoid coffee?

And what would happen if I drink coffee?

What's the worst thing that could happen?
","At the very least, coffee (caffeine actually) can can have a complex interaction with pain medication. 

Caffeine can actually enhance the pain-relief effects of some medications, like aspirin, which is why it's included in some ""combo"" OTC painkillers in some countries. (But if you take these regularly and drink caffeinated drinks too, you may well exceed the daily RDA for caffeine, 400mg/day according to the FDA.)

However:


  Oddly enough, what makes caffeine effective in pain relief can also cause headaches.
  
  Since caffeine narrows the blood vessels that surround your brain, when you stop taking it they expand again, and that can cause pain.


I've also heard that if you don't take any pain meds, coffee will usually enhance your feeling of pain, but I can't find any (reliable) sources to back this up, even though in some circles it is recommended you don't drink caffeinated drinks when you have some (painful) medical (or quasi-medical e.g. tattoo, piercing, laser hair removal) procedures scheduled. YMMV. (Actually a 2018 paper found that habitual coffee drinkers have decreased sensitivity to pain.)

There are probably more aspects to consider including rigors and diuresis/sweating, both of which are probably modulated by caffeine. 

WebMD says (in an MD-reviewed article):


  These drinks won’t help you get over your cold or flu, and some could do more harm than good. [...]
  
  
  Coffee. If you’re going to sip a hot drink, might as well get your daily dose of caffeine in it, right? Wrong. Try to stick with water and nutrient-rich soups.
  


But rather disappointing they don't offer any reasons why coffee should be avoided in this case, except that it is inferior to ""nutrient-rich soups"". But this seems hardly a flu-specific argument, i.e. you can't expect your diet to be just coffee anyway.

The CDC flu [patient] guide makes a similar recommendation:


  If the sick person is not eating well, encourage
  them to drink liquids. Avoid alcohol or drinks
  with caffeine in them such as colas, tea, and
  coffee.


While apparently no reason whatsoever for avoiding coffee is given in there, this is put under the ""Tips to prevent dehydration"" heading, so it's probably due to sweating/diuresis being enhanced by caffeine. This seems to be a really controversial topic, e.g. a Time mag article cites some experts saying otherwise, so it's probably better left for a separate question.


  It’s true that caffeine is a mild diuretic, which means that it causes your kidneys to flush extra sodium and water from the body through urine. If you’re peeing frequently, and thus losing lots of liquid, it’s logical to think you could become dehydrated — but it actually doesn’t work that way, explains Dr. Daniel Vigil, an associate clinical professor of family medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles.
  
  “When you drink a cup of coffee or you drink a glass of iced tea, you are necessarily taking in a volume of fluid along with that dose of [caffeine],” Vigil says. Even though caffeine is a mild diuretic, Vigil says, you won’t lose more fluid through urine than you take in by drinking a caffeinated beverage. Your body is able to absorb as much fluid as it needs and expel the rest, he says.


Some studies seem to back up this latter view, but they involve healthy individuals.
"
"Knowing that the routes of transmissions are mainly (only?) eye, nose, mouth:

https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/modes-of-transmission-of-virus-causing-covid-19-implications-for-ipc-precaution-recommendations

would it be possible to purposely catch it in a specific way so that it will only result in mild symptoms? Maybe even infecting other mucus areas inside the body (by let's say injection) where it cannot spread too much.
It can be useful in situations where the probability of catching the virus in the long run is very high. For example one may prefer to infect the eye and protect the other routes (if possible).

In the same line of thought, maybe infect and then being knowledgeable about the infection one can start the treatment even before the first symptoms or at the first symptoms and aim for later immunity.
","There is no known way to infect yourself with a ""safe"" dose of SARS-CoV-2.  The eyes are listed as a portal of infection which is why health workers wear eye protection (goggles, face shields ).

Once the virus infects human cells it starts to replicate creating more virus.  At some stage the immune system will ramp up and detect the virus but this takes time.  Even if you find a dose of the virus to infect yourself, how are you going to count a few hundred or a few thousand virus particles and make sure you don't exceed the infectious dose?  And that may depend also on host factors.


  The average number of viral particles needed to establish an infection is known as the infectious dose. We don’t know what this is for covid-19 yet, but given how rapidly the disease is spreading, it is likely to be relatively low – in the region of a few hundred or thousand particles, says Willem van Schaik at the University of Birmingham, UK.

"Would it make sense from the public safety point of view to allow the persons already having the antibodies to move more freely than the persons not having the antibodies? Or it is more of an ethical question than a medical one?
","Projects for broad-based antibody blood tests are currently springing up like mushrooms.
But the first test series available will be needed for the staff of health care.

of course there are other interests for antibody tests: virological, epidemiological  and as your question implies economical. 

Antibody blood tests should provide information about the spread of the corona virus so that the measures taken by the authorities can be adapted. A nationwide initiative is now putting pressure.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/new-blood-tests-antibodies-could-show-true-scale-coronavirus-pandemic

For example, if a selected group of people were tested for Sars-CoV-2 antibodies every two weeks, the course of the epidemic would be clearly visible.

The interest, especially in business circles, is huge. Everyone urgently wanted to know where they were in the pandemic, who was at best already immune and could therefore probably move around and work safely again.

Relatively few cases have been diagnosed among children, but it isn’t clear whether that’s because they don’t get infected or because their infections are generally so mild that they go unnoticed. Testing children for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies should resolve that.

"I saw a report that dermatologists are working on coronavirus cases.

Does this mean that all kinds of medical doctors are licensed to care for COVID-19 patients?

So a neurologist can help, cardiologist can help, a urologist / penile enhancement surgeon can help, and also gynecologists?

What about dentists?

Anyone practicing medicine of any form can go to New York City to help right now? 

To be clear, I mean treating COVID-19 patients at the hospitals, in the ER, ICU, etc.

"How long will it remain potent outside an organism?

I'm thinking in the context of if it can survive a couple of weeks or a month in the mail for the recipient to get infected.

Edit:

I tried looking at the WHO's page dedicated to the virus, have not found anything pertaining to my question in the PDFs there (maybe I overlooked something, I guess I'm just lacking the proper keyword to use for the search)

I tried looking at the coronavirus Wikipedia page and have not found anything there.

I did find somewhere that a flu virus would typically not remain potent for more than 14 days outside of an organism, but I'm not sure if this applies to all viruses.  
","Since it seems unlikely that these data are available already from the novel virus, I'll refer to other coronavirus strains associated with outbreaks, the SARS-CoV coronavirus associated with an outbreak in 2003 and MERS-CoV.

In reference to the stability of the virus outside the body for SARS-CoV, the WHO consensus document said:


  Data from the Chinese University in Hong Kong indicated that SARS-CoV has
  been isolated from stool on paper, a Formica surface and a plastered wall after 36 hours, on a plastic surface and stainless steel after 72 hours, and after 96 hours on a glass slide.
  Hospital environmental samples from a number of sites, including walls and the ventilation
  system, tested PCR positive in Canada.


A later follow-up confirmed that SARS-CoV is viable possibly for days in the right conditions:


  In the present study, we have demonstrated that SARS CoV can survive at least two weeks after drying at temperature and humidity conditions found in an air-conditioned environment. The virus is stable for 3 weeks at room temperature in a liquid environment1


1Chan, K. H., Peiris, J. S., Lam, S. Y., Poon, L. L. M., Yuen, K. Y., &amp; Seto, W. H. (2011). The effects of temperature and relative humidity on the viability of the SARS coronavirus. Advances in virology, 2011.

This suggests that SARS-CoV was better at surviving in the environment than other related strains, especially in cool temperatures. However, there was still a substantial decrease in viral titre by 1 week.

For MERS-CoV,


  MERS-CoV virus could still be recovered after 48 hours2


...on plastic and steel surfaces, though not at 72 hours, at 20C. The virus degraded more quickly at higher temperatures.

2Van Doremalen, N., Bushmaker, T., &amp; Munster, V. J. (2013). Stability of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) under different environmental conditions. Eurosurveillance, 18(38), 20590.



Assuming the new 2019-nCoV virus is similar to these, there is a risk of environmental transmission particularly in high-exposure locations like hospitals. It seems far less likely to be a risk after multiple weeks, but there is still little known about the new strain.

I was unable to find more than speculation about rates of actual infection due to exposure in these conditions, but that speculation is mostly focused on the health care setting and in particular on transmission in health care settings despite extensive precautions.

It's very difficult to connect culture viability to actual transmission risks, and not really ethical to swipe different concentrations of a coronavirus on the surfaces of a room and let people wander through to see how many get sick. Therefore, the best evidence for surface transmission of these viruses is when other methods of exposure can be mostly ruled out, and this is a very imperfect estimate.
"
"There's a ridiculous conspiracy theory spreading that coronavirus is a genetically modified biological weapon gone rogue. According to one theory, the virus has traces of HIV and is designed to attack the immune system. My question isn't related to the evidence, which is non-existent, supporting this theory but rather the science behind the claim.

HIV can only spread via blood, semen, pre-seminal fluids, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. Is it even conceivable that an ""HIV like"" virus could spread through the air like coronavirus? The conspiracy theory isn't saying you will get full-blown AIDS but that coronavirus can ""attack the immune system"" (in a way mimicking HIV). I'm not a doctor, but on the surface, the claim that a virus could even somewhat operate like HIV and be airborne sounds absurd.

Several scientists have already said there's no way coronavirus DNA was engineered, but I'm looking for another angle to attack this conspiracy theory.

""There's absolutely nothing in the genome sequence of this virus that indicates the virus was engineered,"" Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, told The Washington Post Sunday.

https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-bioweapon-tom-cotton-conspiracy-theory-china-warfare-leak-2020-2
","I somewhat agree that it's difficult to debunk conspiracy theories, as people that believe in them can and usually will reply to carefully crafted arguments with ""of course that's fabricated too"".

Having said that, I came across this: The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2

It discusses the origins for this virus. Hope you find it useful.

"As it commonly known, mutability is a fundamental characteristic of viruses which presents the ability of virus genome to adapt to physical circumstances, prevent and circumvent vaccine effect and to cover more ranges of carriers, animals and people categories.

COVID-19 belongs to RNA-viruses family, and RNA viruses is known to be very mutable, but how much this is true for COVID-19? How much in comparison with other viruses? I didn't found any reliable researches in this field except this expatiative article from EpiVax.



According to their research, this virus has little-to-zero T-epitopes cross-conservation which makes it very difficult to build a vaccine. Am I right?

What interests me more, is the mutability of the virus. Now mostly aged people are subject to fatality with this virus



but might this situation change later?

"EDIT: After reading the comments and learning more about the current outbreak, I see that the premise of my question is incorrect. I mistakenly believed that the virus' mortality rate was around the same as that of the flu, when in fact it's much higher.



My understanding is that the virus' mortality rate is around 2%, which is similar to the flu. It's less deadly than SARS.

So why are people so worried, and why are governments going to such extreme measures to prevent it from spreading? My guesses are:


We don't know enough about the long-term effects of the virus, so better safe than sorry
The economic and social disruption caused by robust measures (e.g., quarantining) costs less than letting a new disease become pandemic, even if it isn't particularly deadly
Mass hysteria fueled by the media and misinformation
Governments feeling like they have to appear responsive to popular concern lest they seem lazy
This virus affects more developed parts of the world, so it's more visible
The Chinese government's over-the-top, authoritarian, ""only in China""-style measures have left everyone in such awe that they think, ""this must be really serious!"" (When in fact the government's real intention is perhaps to cover up how badly they botched their initial handling of the outbreak.)


As for one's chances of coming into contact with the virus, the total number of confirmed cases in the world as of writing is around 80k. Let's say that the true number is double that, or 160,000. That's still only ~1.5% of the population of Wuhan, the city where the initial outbreak occurred. Why should anyone be in the slightest bit concerned about going for a stroll down the main street?

I'm not an expert in public health or medicine. It would be great to hear an expert's take on this question!
","The danger posed to society from this disease doesn't come from the mortality rate, rather from the potential to make large fraction of the population ill. Unlike the flu virus, this virus is a new virus to which we have no immunity.

About 10% of the infected people requires hospital treatment, which is a lot higher than in case of flu. The death rate of the order of 1% is achieved thanks to excellent hospital treatment. With a far larger fraction of the population infected with this virus compared to the flu and a far larger fraction of the infected people requiring hospital treatment compared to flu, the available hospital capacity to give everyone the treatment they need can be easily exhausted. The death rate due to the virus will then increase.

Also, people who need treatment for other reasons can then also fail to get prompt medical attention. People suffering a heart attack who would have survived under normal circumstances thanks to getting prompt medical attention, may now end up dying too. 
"
"I know that the WHO came up with the COVID-19 name, but I see big publisher (Springer) also using ""SARS-CoV-2"" seemingly to refer to the same thing. To be more technically correct, they say the  latter refers to the virus, rather than the disease:


  SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus responsible for an outbreak of respiratory illness known as COVID-19.


Anyway, who came up with the ""SARS-CoV-2"" name?
","Although the latter term is less publicized in the mass media, a WHO page basically calls it official too, although it was the ICTV that came up with it:


  Viruses are named based on their genetic structure to facilitate the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines. Virologists and the wider scientific community do this work, so viruses are named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).
  
  Diseases are named to enable discussion on disease prevention, spread, transmissibility, severity and treatment. Human disease preparedness and response is WHO’s role, so diseases are officially named by WHO in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
  
  ICTV announced “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)” as the name of the new virus on 11 February 2020.  This name was chosen because the virus is genetically related to the coronavirus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003.  While related, the two viruses are different.   
  
  WHO announced “COVID-19” as the name of this new disease on 11 February 2020, following guidelines previously developed with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
  
  WHO and ICTV were in communication about the naming of both the virus and the disease.


So yeah, the two names originate from different organizations (as far as I can tell the ICTV is not subordinated to the WHO in any way), but they apparently held some talks on the matter. Nonetheless, the WHO does seem a little displeased with including ""SARS"" in the virus name...


  From a risk communications perspective, using the name SARS can have unintended consequences in terms of creating unnecessary fear for some populations, especially in Asia which was worst affected by the SARS outbreak in 2003. 
  
  For that reason and others, WHO has begun referring to the virus as “the virus responsible for COVID-19” or “the COVID-19 virus” when communicating with the public.  Neither of these designations are intended as replacements for the official name of the virus as agreed by the ICTV.


Likewise, some virologists were displeased with the WHO name. In the later published SARS-CoV-2 (naming) paper of ICTV's CSG (Coronaviridae Study Group) they do ""mend fences"" however, saying that:


  By uncoupling the naming conventions used for coronaviruses and the diseases that some of them cause in humans and animals, we wish to support the WHO in its efforts to establish disease names in the most appropriate way. [...] The further advancement of naming conventions is also important because the ongoing discovery of new human and animal viruses by next-generation sequencing technologies can be expected to produce an increasing number of viruses that do not (easily) fit the virus–disease model that was widely used in the pre-genomic era [...]. Having now established different names for the causative virus (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease (COVID-19), the CSG hopes that this will raise awareness in both the general public and public health authorities regarding the difference between these two entities. The CSG promotes this clear distinction because it will help improve the outbreak management and also reduces the risk of confusing virus and disease, as has been the case over many years with SARS-CoV (the virus) and SARS (the disease).

"
"The World Health Organization indicates the COVID-19 genome is detected in assays.  Once a patient tests positive, is there any reason not to expect that future instances of the same assay will result positive?
","There are two general categories of tests typically used for identifying viral infections: those based on viral genetic material and those based on host immune response.

The CDC page on MERS-CoV testing (also a coronavirus, just not the one that causes COVID-19) is an informative resource to start with (bold added and reformatted by me):


  Molecular tests are used to diagnose active infection (presence of MERS-CoV) in people who are thought to be infected with MERS-CoV based on their clinical symptoms and having links to places where MERS has been reported.
  
  Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays are molecular tests that can be used to detect viral RNA in clinical samples.
  
  Serology testing is used to detect previous infection (antibodies to MERS-CoV) in people who may have been exposed to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body’s immune system to attack and kill viruses, bacteria, and other microbes during infection. The presence of antibodies to MERS-CoV indicates that a person had been previously infected with the virus and developed an immune response.


For some diseases, the primary type of test used is measuring immune reactivity; tuberculosis comes to mind.

However, tests currently being used for 2019-nCoV are of the ""molecular"" type: RT-PCR assays detecting viral RNA. Viral RNA is only present during an active infection. These tests can be used both when a patient is showing symptoms, to identify the infection, and also to retest later to show that the infection has been cleared.
"
"Regarding the corona virus, why are there many deaths in Washington but none in new York? 
","Most of the COVID-19 deaths in Washington involve a single nursing home, where the virus spread widely before being detected.

The patients at that facility are in a high-risk category for this disease due to their advanced age; there is no similar cluster of cases at a nursing facility elsewhere in the US, therefore it is not surprising that the mortality rate is quite different so far.

There is speculation that there are far more undiagnosed cases in Washington, many of which would be mild cases. Given issues and limitations with testing, it is difficult to know what the true rate is.

"Is there any global database that enables the stochastic analysis of questions such as age distribution of fatalities, etc?

"As the German chancellor said today, by the end of the year 60-70% of the population will have been through a COVID-19 infection. Where does that number come from?

The basic mechanism is clear, and the magnitude is plausible: Let n be the average number of persons infected by one infected person. If n falls below 1, then the epidemy will run out. This will happen if an infected person mostly hits persons who are already immune.

The question is: Why just 60-70%, not 40-50 or 80-90%? Does it come from historic precedence? Or from some formula that takes into account the value of n (the value before saturation has set in)? What citation classics could serve as reference?
","Some Canadian experts said 35% to 70% will be infected:


  According to a disease-transmission model developed by University of
  Toronto researchers, the virus’ overall attack rate in Canada could
  exceed 70 per cent. That number drops sharply, by about half, “if we
  add modest control,” said epidemiologist Dr. David Fisman, one of the
  model’s creators, but it will take “aggressive social distancing and
  large scale quarantines” to reduce it further, he said.
  
  “That’s still a huge number of people ill, and critically ill people
  are a large fraction in this disease,” Fisman said in an email. “I’m
  not going to share more specific numbers because I think they will
  scare people to no particular end.”


In reality no one knows. I can tell you if they contain the spread no more people will be infected. If they don't contain the spread more people will be infected. Steps like Italy took today where only essential work can occur and all business closed except transportation, grocery stores and pharmacies are a desperate attempt at containment that may be too late. That said given recent numbers it appears to have worked for China.

The German Chancellor is wasting her time and ours spewing off meaningless numbers that will only serve to scare citizens of the nation she is supposed to lead. Something better would be her plan to make the homeless self-isolate for 14 days at home if they come into contact with someone who was positive or preemptively positive.

Today the WHO leader said if American governments (Federal, State, County, City, etc) do not act it could be ""many, many millions"" dead in the USA. Today's US government talk to borrow 40 billion dollars to spend on the pandemic is not a plan.
"
"If the world hadn't noticed that Covid-19 was significantly different from previous situations, and if it had treated it like any other flu outbreak, what would have happened?

Typically an influenza outbreak of any kind results in nursing homes and other sensitive areas being closed to visitors and their taking extra precautions for internal cleanliness and hygiene.

If all the effort were put into protecting the most vulnerable and everyone else simply warned to be careful, the disease would spread among the general population but there would be very few serious cases.

In the short, medium, and long term, would the world be significantly better or worse than it will be with the current political actions?
","I think the following quoted article mostly answers my question.

The current, sometimes draconian, measures are not being taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19, only to reduce the rate at which it spreads.

A system that can handle a hundred new patients each week for many months, typically can't handle hundreds of new patients each day for a few weeks.

In either case, the same number of people get infected.

In one case the seriously ill can be properly treated, in the other case almost no one can be properly treated.

Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) - Our World in Data contains this information:


  ‘Flattening the curve’
  
  This is why early counter measures are important in an epidemic. Their
  intention is to lower the rate of infection so that the epidemic is
  spread out over time and the peak demand for the health care system is
  lower.
  
  While the total number who get infected might not change, the
  containment measures intend to avoid an outbreak trajectory in which a
  large number of people get sick at the same time. This is what the
  visualization shows.
  
  This is the reason that limiting the magnitude of peak incidence of an
  outbreak is important – health systems can care for more patients when
  the number of cases is spread out over a long period and it is not
  peaking in a very short period.
  
  A worst-case scenario for a pandemic of COVID-19 is that the number of
  patients at one point in time is so large that health systems would
  fail to provide the required care for some of them



"
"I have heard several times now, from both people I personally know and from others who have posted their stories online that they do not qualify for COVID-19 testing.

From the stories I have heard, to qualify you have to:
1. Had contact with a known case of COVID-19
2. Been to a country heavily infected with COVID-19
3. Have symptoms that have progressed to the point where hospitalization is required

We now have a reported 1339 cases in the US with likely many more undiagnosed by medical professionals or the CDC.

Why, when we are in a state of pandemic and all countries scrambling to get a handle on the virus, are clinics, primary cares, and even hospitals not administering tests to those who exhibit symptoms unless one of these other criteria are met?

With an incubation period of 2-14 days, it is entirely possible to have contact with someone who has it and not know you got it from them.
","There's yet another reason: a test can provide only a certain amount of information gain. If the probability to have contracted Covid-19 before the test is too low, even though we know more after the test we may not be able to draw  practical conclusions that are any different from the recommendations without test. In other words, if the recommendation goes from ""stay at home and avoid contact to others"" to ""stay at home and avoid contact to others"" the test would be wasted.

The Covid-19 tests are not suitable for screening purposes (i.e. searching for infections among a population where infections are [still] very rare). They are to sort out who is infected and who isn't among high-risk populations where 1 in 10 (or more) are actually infected. 



You may want to look at my longish answer to How accurate are coronavirus tests? for relevant background.



E.g., with the newly emergency approved Roche test, we may say that a positive test result increases the odds of having Covid-19 by factor of somewhere around 30 - 100, a negative result decreases the odds by a factor of 1/50 - 1/17. 

If you are in a risk group with a prevalence of 8 %, the pre-test odds of 8 : 92 


increase to (240 to 800) : 92 or a post-test probability of having Covid-19 of 70 to 90 % with a positive test result, and
decrease to 8 : (4600 to 1564), i.e. the post-test probability of having Covid-19 is somewhere around 0.5 to 0.2 %


These post-test probabilities allow practical conclusions: if you're negative, you're fine and can be let to meet the public, if you're positive you need to go to quarantine and/or treatment.  

8 % prevalence is my guesstimate for those who are currently (Mar 15th) tested in the US (and incidentally, also in Germany).

Now consider the overall US population. With currently 1629 cases and a population of 328 mio., we'd get pre-test odds of 1629 : 328 mio*. 

The test results change this to 


positive result: (27700 to 162900) : 328 mio or a post-test probability of having Covid-19 of 0.008 to 0.005 %
negative result: we don't even need to calculate this, because the pre-test probability was only 0.0005 %, post-test probability is lower.


Even if we assume that there's a dark number of yet unknown Covid-19 cases, say, a factor 20 over the known cases, the post-test probabiliy after a positive test is about 0.2 % to 1%. 

What would be the practical conclusion? Well, probably that the positive case should stay at home as much as possible  and avoid contacts. Certainly not that they can rely on acquiring immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

Even for low risk groups who have flu-like symptoms but no known contact to Covid infected people (or other high-risk situations) the pre-test probability of having Covid is too low to allow the test to make a meaningful difference: after all, even if it is ""only a common flu"", they should stay at home, get well and not infect others meanwhile. 
While the pre-test probability is likely to increase (because more people get infected), in order to keep the health system/hospitals working the recommendation will probably not change: stay at home in self-quarantine as long as the symptoms are mild, so that the health system is not burdened by cases that get well on their own.

We may also say that were the whole US population to be tested in that situation, the 32500 true cases of Covid would be drowned in 3 - 10 mio. false positve cases.

"According to the World Health Organization's situation report for March 12th, the African region has only recorded 51 cases of the Covid-19 virus, and only one of these cases has been fatal. The disease has so far only been recorded in 9 of the 54 African countries, with only three of these countries reporting more than a couple of cases.

Given the wider spread of the disease in practically every other region, and that the African population is around 1.3 billion, this appears to be a clear anomaly.

What reasons are there for this apparent inconsistency with expectations?
","Health care in many sub-Saharan African countries is extremely sparse. As an example, Sierra Leone has less than 250 doctors for the entire country.
As a result, it is likely that cases in that and similar countries are grossly under-reported.

"The COVID-19 R0 factor is 2-3, while SARS had an R0 factor of 2-5. However, COVID-19 has infected around 130,000 people and growing, while SARS totalled just under 9000 people infected.

Why is COVID-19 spreading faster and wider than SARS? What other factors have let COVID-19 reach pandemic levels, while SARS was contained and eradicated? Could the R0 factor be higher than believed? Was it initially slower to be contained?

Full disclosure, I'm not in medicine or a medical scientist. I'm a software developer and data scientist, and this has peaked my interested in the spread of infectious disease.
","The viruses are acting differently.  Sars2-ncov-19 virus is much more infectious with a much higher viral replication rate, and with people exhaling the virus in the pre-symptomatic phase whereas SARS this was not happening.  Once the infected individual becomes symptomatic their bodies are producing antibodies which helps shut down viral particle shedding though virus is still being transmitted by cough which aerolizes the virus at a further distance then just by exhalation.


  The nine patients, who were admitted to the same Munich hospital, were studied because they had had close contact with an index case. Cell cultures and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were done on throat swabs and samples of sputum, stool, blood, and urine. Throat swabs showed very high viral shedding during the first week of symptoms.
  
  The findings contrasted starkly with those from the 2003 outbreak of SARS in terms of viral load. ""In SARS, it took 7 to 10 days after onset until peak RNA concentrations (of up to 5x105 copies per swab) were reached,"" the researchers wrote. ""In the present study, peak concentrations were reached before day 5, and were more than 1,000 times higher.""


but the mean incubation period is 5 days.

"It is recommended to regularly wash hands with soap to slow the spread of COVID-19. However regularly washing with soap can be harmful to the skin. Soap-free cleansers such as QV Wash are frequently used in place of soap by those with dermatological conditions.

How effective are soap-free cleansers are at slowing the spread of COVID-19?
","You need a molecule that disrupts the lipid layer of the virus to expose its RNA, and deactivate it.  

Until the manufacturer of QV Wash can confirm that it is capable of inactivating viruses, in particular the sars2-ncov-19 virus, then you should assume it won't work.


  When you wash your hands with soap and water, you surround any microorganisms on your skin with soap molecules. The hydrophobic tails of the free-floating soap molecules attempt to evade water; in the process, they wedge themselves into the lipid envelopes of certain microbes and viruses, prying them apart.
  
  “They act like crowbars and destabilize the whole system,” said Prof. Pall Thordarson, acting head of chemistry at the University of New South Wales. Essential proteins spill from the ruptured membranes into the surrounding water, killing the bacteria and rendering the viruses useless.

"Lately I'm reading about the good Coronavirus-Tests in South Korea, the faulty tests in the USA and the tests in Indonesia which are according to some Singapore newspapers not even working.

I wonder why these tests are so different and can't find proper information on what which country is testing for. 
","First of all the disclaimer: I'm analytical chemist but not clinical chemist. That is, I professionally do things that are related/to some extent similar to test kit development, but not for medical use, and I've only been very remotely involved with microbiology-related testing. OTOH, I expect that pretty much everyone who works in this field is likely to work a lot these days and not to have any time to hang out on SX.

So this is all AFAIK, and I'm happy be corrected - and OP please take this with the appropriate caution against stuff written in the internet by random strangers.


The tests are developed in much haste, and undergo some emergency validation rather than the full validation procedure that is usually required. This naturally leads to some uncertainty about their performance, but we accept that in order to have tests available at all right now.
See e.g. what the FDA says about Covid tests  
List with FDA Emergency Use Approved Covid tests. 
Different tests search for different parts of the virus RNA.
(This is getting very far from my field, but is this the information you're looking for as what exctly is tested [by the CDC-developed test]?)
Viruses mutate, so a test that works well at some place at one time may not work as well somewhere else or a few weeks or months later. 
For a test to work, 


sampling 
possibly transport
extraction from the sample (difficulty varies e.g. between mouth swabs and sputum)
the test kit  


must all work well. E.g. if the sampling is not done properly because there's no properly trained staff available, nothing can be done further down the analytic process. I don't know why the Indonesian tests don't work, but it may be as ""simple"" as samples undergoing long transportation to a lab with the appropriate equipment so they spoil on the way.
The faulty tests in the US seem to have had a wrong reagent - and burocratic approval was needed for the labs to replace that by their own good reagents.

"Why is the Seegene COVID molecular genetic test not approved by the FDA?  Today's Google search with the the two keywords: FDA + Seegene returned an article (12-March indicating that the Seegene COVID 19 test is not FDA approved:

FDA Has Not Approved South Korea COVID-19 Testing Kit Fast Automated Multiple Testing Genes, People

Was the test evaluated by the FDA?  I would think that there is more than enough sample data having been fielded in KR.  What rigors did FDA approval of the Roche COVID test meet? 
","The linked post (which reads to me rather like rant than a news post) not the underlying CNN article indiate that the manufacturer actually applied for FDA EUA (Emergency Use Approval). Without such an application, there (rather obviously) won't be an approval.  


  Was the test evaluated by the FDA?



The clinical evaluation needs to be done by the manufacturer, not by the FDA. The FDA then evaluates the results submitted by the manufacturer with ther EUA application. 
The test is not on the FDA page that lists approved tests.
We don't know why. E.g., whether they it did not pass the FDA EUA requirements (I'd think that unlikely) or the manufacturer never applied (which may be totally sensible for several reasons, e.g. if their manufacturing capactity is such that all the tests they produce are bought, say, in East Asia)



  What rigors did FDA approval of the Roche COVID test meet? 



see the FDA FAQ on getting EUA and requirements for using a test even before that EUA is in place on the general requirements and 
the Roche test Manufacturer's instructions listing their validation results in particular.
FDA explicitly says that they want the manufacturer to be in early contact with them. 




A few more thoughts:


It is not only the test kit that needs approval, the test kit gets approved for use with certain extraction equipment (manufacturer &amp; possibly model) and also the lab needs certain approval.
It may be that in East Asia different machines (other manufacturers) are used, so that the South Korean approval cannot be used for evaluating performance with the machinery predominantly used by US labs.
The first EUA for the CDC Covid test was granted by the FDA on Feb. 4th. I.e., one day before Seegene had their first test kit according to the CNN post and thus more than a week before the Seegene test got South Korean fast-track approval.  
That such a test with fast track validation may turn out not to be that great after all is a known risk which is accepted in the current situation in order to have tests available at all. We still would not expect faulty reagents in the test kit, though.   
Theres nothing that unique about the South Korean  test manufacturer. There are other manufacturers and also ones that were apparently even earlier (sent out first [unapproved] tests on Jan 10th) than the South Koreans, see e.g. this new post about a Berlin manufacturer of such tests (in German). This news post reads very similar to the South Korean, just with a different company.
We also don't know yet how long/where which test will perform well as mutations of the virus will happen - and they may affect the performance of some tests but possibly not others. The Berlin test manufacturer discusses this in another newspaper article/interview.
AFAIK, other test kits also don't require manual PCR - whether in some countries the testing is done manually because the local approved labs don't have automated extraction/PCR machinery in place is a totally different question.

"I just got back from the Netherlands and read a notice on the CDC web site that says I ""must"" self quarantine for 14 days.

I guess I don't understand. I think the Netherlands has 2 cases and my home state of New Hampshire has 6. So, the logic is what? I am potentially infected and the rest of New Hampshire is not. I mean if New Hampshire has more cases than the Netherlands, doesn't that mean every one of the 1.4 million people in New Hampshire should ""self quarantine""?

What is the logic here?


","At this time (17-March-2020) the state of New Hampshire has not found evidence of community transmission of the virus, and all 13 cases are associated with overseas travel.

You have travelled in from overseas where there is community transmission so the possibility is much higher that you have been infected.  The infected in the pre-symptomatic phase are still highly contagious spreading virus just by breathing based on small studies so far.

Once community transmission is detected then it may be too late to start isolating people from out of state, and the whole state may need to go into self isolation as was done in China.

The protection factors of FFP respirators against particles in the size range of 0.093–1.61 μm were not size dependent. The size ranges of viral and bacterial particles fall into this size range, and they are expected to have similar PFs. The FFP respirators provided about 11.5 to 15.9 times better protection than the SMs, suggesting that SMs are not a good substitute for FFP respirators when concerns exist about airborne transmission of bacterial and viral pathogens.

"In forest management, a controlled burn is “used for hazard reduction [to] decrease the likelihood of serious hotter fires” [W]. In backfiring strategy, “firefighters attempt to halt the advance of a wildfire (…) by burning up fuel in its path” [H].

Could the same strategy be used to fight the Coronavirus?

E.g. in my native country (Norway), most hotels are now closed. If, for the sake of the argument, we assume that 1) humans become immune after having fallen sick to the virus and 2) people under 25 do not become seriously ill, what is the counterargument to inviting people in the age group 15-25 to mass isolate in said hotels for e.g. 1 month, for the purpose of kickstarting herd immunity?

(In the meantime, they would also be off the streets, presumably posing less of a risk to the more vulnerable population, and students would have a chance of colocating.)

","Computer simulations have been carried in London, UK, on a proposal to let the virus loose on the population as a whole and isolate those at risk.

But the models showed that there would be a huge death toll (over 2,000,000 for the USA) adopting this approach.  Younger people survive better with full medical support, but that does not mean they don't get very sick.  (At least one 14 year old child has died, and half the ICU beds in France are occupied by people in their 40s. ) And this strategy would overwhelm the health system.


  A new analysis by immunologists at Imperial College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine of the impact of the coronavirus in Italy suggested that up to 30 percent of patients hospitalized with the virus would require intensive care treatment. Those numbers, if repeated in the U.K., would quickly overwhelm Britain’s state-run National Health Service.

This means that if you have mild symptoms, yes, you will eventually ""cure"" yourself, the same way you would recover from a typical common cold, or how a healthy individual would typically handle influenza.


  If your symptoms worsen with home care, it’s important to get prompt medical care.


This means if you have bad symptoms, then home care is not enough, and you need the assistance that a hospital can provide. There is still no cure that medical care can provide; instead, the purpose of getting care is to prevent your symptoms from killing you before your immune system can handle the infection on its own. For some this includes mechanical ventilation: using a machine to help you breathe.

"The genome of Covid-19 was mapped in early Feb. The gene for a protein spike was used to produce these spike proteins. 3-D microscopy of this synthesized spike has been produced. Quoting McLellan from this article:


  ""the molecule looks really good; it's really well behaved; the
  structure kind of demonstrates that the molecule is stable in the
  correct confirmation that we were hoping for,"" McLellan said. ""So now
  we and others will use the molecule that we created as a basis for
  vaccine antigen.""


Also saying:


  In theory, the spike protein itself ""could be either the vaccine or
  variants of a vaccine,"" McLellan said. When you inject this
  spike-protein-based vaccine, ""humans would make antibodies against the
  spike, and then if they were ever exposed to the live virus,""


The article goes on to say:


  Their colleagues at the NIH will now inject these spike proteins into
  animals to see how well the proteins trigger antibody production.
  Still, McLellan thinks a vaccine is likely about 18 to 24 months away.
  That's ""still quite fast compared to normal vaccine development, which
  might take like 10 years,"" he said.


My question is: Why not inject, or drink, these spike proteins for immunity to Covid-19? Why expect an 18-24 month wait? The anti-body production response should occur(and be detectable) in days?
","Vaccines need extensive testing before they can be used. There's essentially no medical intervention which requires more testing than vaccines, which are used in extremely large numbers of healthy patients.

Generally this involves basic research, animal testing, Phase I testing (""Is it safe in humans? At what dose?""), Phase II testing (""Is it effective? At what dose? Are there side effects?""), and Phase III testing (""Is it safe and effective across all different subpopulations?"").

As just one example of what could potentially go wrong: many/most COVID-19 deaths involve cytokine storms which are, roughly, damaging inflammatory immune overreactions. Priming the immune system could potentially worsen them and increase deaths by strengthening the immune response. (It doesn't seem likely, but this is why we test.)

  does that mean every one in the world at some point has to get infected until a vaccine is invented?


No. There are many infectous diseases which are only regional, or have been almost eradicated. Countries free of (this or that) disease need to act quickly on imported cases, if the disease is highly infectuous. 

On the other hand, if the spread of a pathogen in a (say closed) region is slowed down substantially, people who have developed immunity in this region will generally make the reproductive factor of the epidemic lower - and thus make it easier to contain its spread. 

You may have a look at the last simulation in:

"Disclaimer: I am a scientist, but this is not my main field so sorry if I've not used the correct terminology at this busy time...

Since the coronavirus protein bonds with and gains entry to the cell by bonding to ACE2 receptor, does anyone happen to be currently working upon inhibition of the ACE2 receptor?

Obviously it's not straight forward just to use an inhibitor of some sort without accounting for side effects, but is this form of therapy a potentially practical avenue?

I anticipate that this relationship with ACE2 is why we get pneumonia with COVID19 since ACE2 is abundant in the lungs, heart and kidneys... And that perhaps it's why people with cardiovascular disease and problems have the highest mortality?

From my understanding, there would be potential cardiac and renal issues. Possibly the negative effects of inhibitors may be reduced or managed by IV infusion of angiotensin 1-7, or supporting drugs (I.e. a vasodilator) as ACE2 won't be able to work on converting angiotensin 2?

To anyone whom is working in this area specifically, what I am really asking is, is this a viable avenue to consider, as a management strategy to reduce spread of the virus in-vivo?

The infection route and effects make me wonder how many people that recover from COVID19 may unfortunately suffer later cardiological or renal issues due to damage in ACE2 expression within the lungs... And not just lung damage from the virus or resulting pneumonia. (I.e fibrosis of cardiac tissues, etc)

I've found this: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijpep/2012/256294/ 
Which seems to suggest that it has been studied to an extent in animals, but find limited information.

*** Note I'm talking about ACE2 inhibition not ACE inhibitors that are often used in heart failure
","The problem appears to be that the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to the ACE2 receptor and carries the receptor into the cell where the RNA of the virus is then released. Because the cell now lacks ACE2 surface receptors this leads to intracellular damage due to lack of inhibition of AT1-R in the Renin Angiotensin System.  

The cells that are damaged in the lung are deep alveolar cells that make surfactant and this collapses the alveoli causing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. interestingly lung infiltrates are seen early in the disease hence the use in China of CT chest scans for screening before rapid PCR became available. ACE2 are also found widely throughout the heart and gut the latter where it assists enzymes that are transporting amino acids.  The ACE2 receptor bearing cells are found in cardiac tissue, lung, gut, macrophages etc and the main clinical effect of their loss of function is to cause cardiopulmonary damage.

if you were to create a drug that targeted the ACE2 receptor then you would be replicating the deleterious effect of the virus which inter alia blocks the protective effect of ACE2 on pulmonary and renal damage.

There's been some experimental work showing that a fully humanised soluble ACE2 receptor can bind to the virus and blocks entry into the ACE2 bearing cells. It works like a neutralising antibody to the virus. 

This treatment is currently awaiting Chinese FDA approval for clinical trials.

"What is the best protocol and criteria or policy for COVID-19 novel coronavirus testing?

During early U.S. infections, the criteria have been stringent due to limited test availability.  As tests become more accessible, what should be the set of risk factors that direct people to get tested -- versus staying at home without getting tested?
","University of Washington (UW Medicine) suggests Testing Criteria on their site:
https://covid-19.uwmedicine.org/Pages/default.aspx

The following patients with COVID-19 symptoms should be tested for COVID-19:
• Patients hospitalized with severe lower respiratory illness
• Healthcare workers
• Patients in other public safety occupations (e.g., law enforcement, fire fighter, EMS)
• Patients involved in an illness cluster in a facility or institution (e.g., healthcare, school, corrections,
homeless/shelters, other institution/congregate setting)
The following patients with COVID-19 symptoms should contact their healthcare provider and be tested for
COVID-19 if their symptoms worsen or their healthcare provider recommends testing:
• Patients older than 60 years
• Patients with underlying medical conditions
• Pregnant women
Younger, healthy individuals with mild illness do not need to be tested. They should stay home for 7 days or
72 hours after symptom resolution, whichever is longer. Additionally, testing is not recommended in
persons who are asymptomatic. A negative test result does not rule out an infection.
There are currently no restrictions on who can be tested for COVID-19 and commercial testing is becoming
more available. Healthcare providers may test any patient with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (e.g.,
fever, cough, shortness of breath).

  Post-viral anosmia is one of the leading causes of loss of sense of smell in adults, accounting for up to 40% cases of anosmia. Viruses that give rise to the common cold are well known to cause post-infectious loss, and over 200 different viruses are known to cause upper respiratory tract infections. Previously described coronaviruses are thought to account for 10-15% cases. It is therefore perhaps no surprise that the novel COVID-19 virus would also cause anosmia in infected patients.


But people are reporting anosmia as a presenting symptom.  What are the percentages here?
","This situation has not been fully characterised yet and has not been reported in the cases as a significant presentation before.  But ENT UK has issued the following advisory and hopes to stall the inappropriate use of steroids for anosmia


  There is already good evidence from South Korea, China and Italy that significant numbers of patients with proven COVID-19 infection have developed anosmia/hyposmia. In Germany it is reported that more than 2 in 3 confirmed cases have anosmia. In South Korea, where testing has been more widespread, 30% of patients testing positive have had anosmia as their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases. 
  
  In addition, there have been a rapidly growing number of reports of a significant increase in the number of patients presenting with anosmia in the absence of other symptoms – this has been widely shared on medical discussion boards by surgeons from all regions managing a high incidence of cases. Iran has reported a sudden increase in cases of isolated anosmia, and many colleagues from the US, France and Northern Italy have the same experience. I have personally seen four patients this week, all under 40, and otherwise asymptomatic except for the recent onset of anosmia – I usually see roughly no more than one a month. I think these patients may be some of the hitherto hidden carriers that have facilitated the rapid spread of COVID-19. Unfortunately, these patients do not meet current criteria for testing or self-isolation.
  
  While there is a chance the apparent increase in incidence could merely reflect the attention COVID-19 has attracted in the media, and that such cases may be caused by typical rhinovirus and coronavirus strains, it could potentially be used as a screening tool to help identify otherwise asymptomatic patients, who could then be better instructed on self-isolation.
  
  Given the potential for COVID-19 to present with anosmia, and the reports that corticosteroid use may increase the severity of infection, we would advise against use of oral steroids in the treatment of new onset anosmia during the pandemic, particularly if it is unrelated to head trauma or nasal pathology (such as nasal polyps).
  
  There is potential that if any adult with anosmia but no other symptoms was asked to self-isolate for seven days, in addition to the current symptom criteria used to trigger quarantine, we might be able to reduce the number of otherwise asymptomatic individuals who continue to act as vectors, not realising the need to self-isolate. It will also be an important trigger for healthcare personnel to employ full PPE and help to counter the higher rates of infection found amongst ENT surgeons compared to other healthcare workers.

"I am in Montreal now and unable to leave because if I go home they will sent me in quarantine in various places where I do not want to go.

Question: Do bedbugs transmit COVID-19 from person to person?
","Bed bugs eat blood.  Red cells do not contain DNA which can be hijacked by the SARS-CoV-2 virus so the bugs should not have any viable virus unless the bug is covered with infected droplets of someone's cough.  That seems highly improbable.


  Bed bugs are not known to spread disease. Bed bugs can be an annoyance because their presence may cause itching and loss of sleep. Sometimes the itching can lead to excessive scratching that can sometimes increase the chance of a secondary skin infection.


and 


  A common concern with bed bugs is whether or not they transmit diseases. Although bed bugs can harbor various pathogens, transmission to humans has not been proven and is considered unlikely.


However, blood also contains some macrophages which have been shown to possess ACE2 receptors which could lead to the macrophages getting infected though surface expression is low.  One would have to posit that the virus enters the bug's gut but somehow leaves again, and somehow reaches the bugs' beak while being unable to replicate.  

To further put this into perspective a cc of blood has usually less than 15,000 white cells. The volume of blood suckled by a bed bug is a way lot less, and macrophages are further sparse in white cells at 5%.

"According to this article, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could be effective treatments for Covid-19.


  Assuming the drugs are well tolerated in clinical trials and seem effective at treating COVID-19, the FDA will take measures to increase the nation's supply, according to Hahn.


Assuming best case scenario, when could these drugs be made widely available to treat the disease? By ""when,"" I mean how long is it likely to take?
","Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.. chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (and possibly in concert with azithromycin) have been touted over the past few days as a possible treatment regimen.

And there's some cause for that - the antiviral properties of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in vitro are broad and it's been trialed against various things (HIV, Ebola etc), however this hasn't always transferred particularly well into an actual treatment. And there's some research suggesting that it can successfully battle SARS-CoV-2 in vitro too. However, killing something in a petri dish is one thing, treating a disease in a human is another.

There has been some preliminary trials done - I believe there's been some fairly non-specific vagueness about it being promising when used in China and there's a relatively new study that's come from Gautret et al in France.

The Gautret et al paper looks promising - on the surface. It seems to suggest that treating people with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin looks great:



Unfortunately though it's not that simple.. first up we aren't talking about a great number of people here. The entire study comprised 42 patients (16 of which were the control), which isn't a huge sample size. And any patients who were on the treatment who got worse were removed from the analysis:


  Six hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were lost in follow-up during the survey because of early cessation of treatment. Reasons are as follows: three patients were transferred to intensive care unit, including one transferred on day2 post-inclusion who was PCR-positive on day1, one transferred on day3 post-inclusion who was PCR-positive on days1-2 and one transferred on day4 post-inclusion who was PCR- positive on day1 and day3; one patient died on day3 post inclusion and was PCR-negative on day2; one patient decided to leave the hospital on day3 post-inclusion and was PCR-negative on days1-2; finally, one patient stopped the treatment on day3 post-inclusion because of nausea and was PCR-positive on days1-2-3. 


So the picture isn't quite as rosy as the graph makes it look. Some people on this treatment still got worse, one died.

It get's even shonkier (technical term) when you look at the large swathes of control patients who didn't have the PCR test done for viral loads:



They effectively only properly measured the viral loads for 4 of the 16 control patients, so trying to compare the groups is verging on meaningless.

So before we look at ""when"" they'll be widely available to treat SARS-CoV-2 I'd be more concerned with answering whether they should be used to treat it. Hydroxychloroquine is not exactly harmless - while less toxic to humans than chloroquine, it's not something to give lightly, it can have immunosuppressant effects, and in sufficient dosages can result in potentially lethal cardiotoxicity.

It may yet prove to be an effective treatment - and the WHO is trialing it (along with other potential treatments) as part of their mega-trial SOLIDARITY, but let's not get too excited just yet.

","The best theoretical model we have is that the SARS and SARS-CoV-2 viruses knock out the ACE2 receptor found on numerous tissues including alveolar cells, and myocytes, and intestinal luminal cells.

If those cells have died then they need to be replaced, and if and until when that happens there will be reduced organ function.

CT scans of recovered patients show some have ground glass changes pointing to extensive damage and scarring which may be irreversible.

"Before the vaccine for German measles was available, girls were encouraged to expose themselves to a friend or acquaintance who had the disease, to acquire immunity, so that they would not end up contracting the illness later on during a pregnancy.

Following on from that logic, would it make sense for a person over 60 (of generally good health and a non-smoker) to purposely contract COVID some time this summer, so as to have immunity next winter?  (Obviously, if the person did that, they would strictly quarantine themselves.)

I've understood that social distancing practices are partly designed to smear out infections, so they don't all hit a community suddenly like a tsunami.  So, that leads me to think that it would be beneficial for society to have new cases occur in a staggered way.
","Rubella doesn't generally kill that's why they had those parties lacking a vaccine.

Since we are now seeing many ICU beds being occupied by victims in their 30s etc， a different patient profile than in China, then it would be like using Russian roulette doing what you suggest.

"In WHO official website ""What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?"", it doesn't mention that wearing mask an effective measure to protect people. 

I don't understand why wearing mask is not good way to prevent infection of COVID-19. 
Is it just because masks are out of stock?
","CDC website:


  PPE is the least effective control because it involves a high level
  of worker involvement and is highly dependent on proper fit and
  correct, consistent use.


e.g. The likelihood for untrained personalto properly use PPE is not realistic, so it would be negligent of the WHOto suggest this to the public for this use.

This does not address reducing transmission. Though, masks, used by those untrained, are not realistic in halting the spread.  One method that has proven to halt the spread is self-quarantine (both healthy and non-healthy) and social distancing and the other recommendations listed in the link provided.
"
"Current statistics on number of cases will always be a few days behind reality due to the time between infection and going to get tested, asymptomatic people, etc. But why not take a random sample of a few thousand people people, and test all of them to see how many of them have the virus? Would that not give us a picture of the proportion of people who have the virus?
","Italy has 60 million people and around 70 thousand (known) cases. That's barely more than 1 in 1000 prevalence. For most countries it's less than this. So, you'd need a huge sample for a good estimate. And those tests/resources are better deployed where suspected cases are, for the time being.

And sensible or not, I've heard this from a colleague, and it's confirmed by the news that Romania's capital Bucharest plans to randomly test a sample of 10,500 people to determine the extent of the virus spread over there.


  Manager of the “Matei Bals” Infectious Diseases Institute Adrian Streinu-Cercel has announced that a pilot project for testing 10,500 persons for the novel coronavirus will start in Bucharest within a scientific study to detect those infected with SARS CoV-2 virus, from the desire to thus prevent the severe forms of illness.
  
  Streinu-Cercel mentioned that, for a population of approximately 2 million inhabitants, the testing of 9,558 persons is necessary, with a correction of 10% being applied to this number. He also stated that the sample can be resized along the way. In this regard, Streinu-Cercel referred to the recommendations of the World Health Organization, which asked that testing be conducted to detect COVID 19. The manager of the “Matei Bals” Institute showed that it is necessary to test the medical staff and patients, but also the population, in order to know if “it’s healthy, if it is currently infected or went through the infection” with this virus, these three pieces of information completely changing how this pandemic is approached in the near future. [...]
  
  Streinu-Cercel underscored that, in lack of screening, the mild forms can go undetected, generating subsequent forms of severe infections. He also mentioned that the Minister of Health approved this project and stressed that this is a study with “scientific value,” not a simple testing. At the same time, he mentioned that in Bucharest there are 188 people diagnosed positively.


Note that ~200 cases in 2M is 1:10,000.

Ha, ha, the more amusing part is that this turned out to be ""fake news!"" But it's actually informative to read the ""retraction/information"" as to why they are not actually doing such a study [obviously: insufficient testing capacity for the proposed sample.]


  After the manager of the “Matei Bals” Institute for Infectious Diseases, Adrian Streinu-Cercel and Bucharest mayor Gabriela Firea had announced on Thursday that 10,514 people from 5 different age groups in Bucharest will be tested for the novel Coronavirus, PM Ludovic Orban reacted and said this is not possible.
  
  “We cannot establish the people to be tested randomly. Selecting 10,000 are just stories, there is a priority list for testing, it depends on how the situation and the testing capacity are developing,” the PM told a conference at the Health Ministry’s HQs.
  
  Orban said that the medical staff and those targeted by the epidemiological inquiries are qualifying for testing first, adding that “Romania has not been ready and the testing capacity has been limited”.
  
  The premier said that “the testing capacity in Romania will increase up to 2,000 next week” and will gradually rise, but to select 10,000 people “are just stories”, the more the death toll has been low in Romania.


In older news I see that India conducted a random test on 500 of their citizens. Rather predictably, they all came out negative.

By the way, if what you want to find out are the proportion of asymptomatic cases, there are some studies (albeit on fairly contained populations) that may have an answer to that, e.g. one on the Diamond Princess (the cruise ship quarantined off Japan):


  [Overall:] Our estimated asymptomatic proportion is at 17.9% (95%CrI: 15.5–20.2%), which overlaps with a recently derived estimate of 33.3% (95% confidence interval: 8.3–58.3%) from data of Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan.
  
  [Caveat:] Considering that most of the passengers were 60 years and older, the nature of the age distribution may lead to underestimation if older individuals tend to experience more symptoms. 


From a 2nd study on the Diamond Princess, it's informative to read the testing strategy/order:


  Overall 3,063 PCR tests were performed among [the 3,711] passengers and crew members. Testing started among the elderly passengers, descending by age.

"
"I stumbled upon this boiled down news article which makes the statement that if we get the doubling time for coronavirus cases above the incubation period (5.8 days), we will be able to effectively ""flatten the curve"".

Could someone explain to me the logic behind that statement? Can't wrap my head around it. Even if the doubling time  is 6 days, in theory (I realise the curve will naturally flatten as a result of population size and number of people already infected) you're still going to see an exponential increases in cases (i.e. 50000, 100000, 200000, 400000...)
","One of the issues with COVID-19 is the fact that it is transmissible even by people who are asymptomatic. You've probably heard about R0, which is the basic reproduction rate of a disease, that takes into account transmission modes and contact rate, among other things. I'm not an epidemiologist, but I'm operating under the assumption that someone who is obviously sick will infect relatively fewer people than someone who is asymptomatic, assuming similar contagiousness - the sick person should quarantine themself and clearly take measures to avoid spreading their sickness. A seemingly well individual, on the other hand, may not reduce their contact rate and unwittingly spread the disease. 

Under this assumption, consider what happens when the incubation time is equal to the doubling rate. Suppose we have 1000 individuals who have the disease, but don't know it yet because they are still in the incubation period. 5.8 days later, there are now 2000 people with the disease, 1000 of which now feel sick, and 1000 of which still feel fine. Those 1000 sick people quarantine themselves, dramatically lowering their rate of infecting others, let's say to 0 for the sake of simplicity. 5.8 days later, the 1000 asymptomatic people now feel sick, after having infected another 1000 people, although the 1000 already-sick individuals haven't infected anyone else. At this rate, we have a linear increase in the number of cases, since old cases are quarantining themselves at the same rate new cases are spread - the number of people spreading the disease unwittingly remains constant!

I've made several assumptions here, like that the transmission rate for asymptomatic individuals is higher than that of symptomatic individuals (although some symptoms, like cough, increase infectivity, and not all symptomatic individuals quarantine appropriately). I'm also not sure this is really an appropriate use of ""doubling time"" - strictly speaking, if 1000 people quarantine, and 1000 asymptomatic people infect 1000 others, it is not a doubling of cases. The statement also seems a bit of tautological red herring - if you are able to lengthen the doubling time, you have already flattened the curve, regardless of the incubation period. But I think the general idea is that a longer doubling time can lessen the impact of asympomatic, but contagious individuals spreading the disease.

"If Covid-19 can float in the air over particles and be there for up to 3 hours (1:50 minute), and if the virus could get into your system through eyes, nose or mouth (See Spread from contact with contaminated surfaces or objects section), then would not be better to use one of those suits to have full protection?

If no, why?

Suits and face mask like these ones



The mask, only covers your nose and mouth, if used properly. What about the eyes protection then?
","In an ideal world everyone would have full body Ebola type protection. In the world of practicality, the WHO has advised that this is a droplet, and surface spread infection.  However, it is not discounting the possibility of aerosols especially during some medical procedures eg. induced coughing, and then a potentially ill fitting mask and goggles may not be enough even in a negative pressure room.

If the full protection is available people are using it.  But there's a shortage of even basic masks in the USA and elsewhere.

"I don't own a working bike, but I do have a bike-sharing system membership.  My city's bike-sharing system has many stations.  I can borrow a bike and ride it to any other station.

There's currently a worldwide pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus.  So far, only 27 people in my country have died from confirmed COVID-19 cases.  (Source.)  Unfortunately, infectious diseases tend to spread exponentially, at least at first.  (Source.)

During the COVID-19 pandemic, is it safe for me to use bike-sharing or bike-rental services? If so, must I follow any special safety precautions?
","This answer was written on Mar.&nbsp;25; things can change quickly. By the time you read this answer, it may or may not still be correct.

Summary


Bike sharing is probably safe and healthy, as long as you take certain hygiene and disinfection precautions, as explained in later sections.
Don't ride when sick.
Exercise, in moderation, may strengthen the immune system.
Sun exposure may help you synthesize vitamin D. It's possible that this vitamin somewhat helps protect against COVID-19.


Introduction

It's probably safe and healthy to use bike-sharing during the COVID-19 pandemic — as long as you take some simple precautions.

If you take these precautions, bike-sharing is probably safer than public transit during the pandemic. (Source.)

Please note: If you're sick, please don't use bike sharing. Please use your own car or bike. Or, better yet, please stay home. (Source.)

Hygiene


After riding, wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. (Source.)
If you can't access soap or water, carry and use hand sanitizer instead.


Disinfecting handlebars

You might have thought it unnecessary to disinfect handlebars, for three reasons.


The CDC writes: ""It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. But this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.""
On stainless steel, coronavirus particles can survive for two days, but virus titers start to plummet after just four hours. (Source.)
Ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun seems to destroy coronaviruses. (Source.)


However, during the pandemic, various experts do recommend that you disinfect bike-share bike handlebars and brake levers. If a sick person used a bike right before you, they might have left their germs on the handlebars; disinfection can kill these germs. (Source.)

70% rubbing alcohol solution is probably a good disinfectant to use here.


At home:


Dampen a clean rag, or some paper towels, with 70% rubbing alcohol solution.
Store the result an air-tight bag, so that the alcohol doesn't evaporate.

Later, at the bike-share station:


Dampen the handlebars and brake levers with the solution. Let them stay damp for at least 30 seconds.



In theory, alcohol probably shouldn't damage most rubber items. (Source.) But please see the comments on this post.

Disinfecting wipes containing benzalkonium chloride (e.g. Lysol wipes) are another option. Benzalkonium chloride may promote antibiotic resistance and is toxic to fish. If you do use Lysol wipes, wash your hands after use and before eating.

If there are shortages of disinfecting wipes or rubbing alcohol in your city: Please consider leaving these items for sick people who truly need them. Instead, please avoid touching your face, and wash your hands after riding.

Exercise may strengthen the immune system

The research literature suggests that exercise, if done in moderation, probably strengthens the immune system. (Source.) During a pandemic, experts recommend against exercising in crowded spaces, or beyond the point of exhaustion, or when feeling flu-like symptoms. (Source.)

Sun exposure may protect against COVID-19

When your skin is exposed to moderate amounts of sunlight, it may synthesize vitamin D. (Don't get sunburned; this increases your risk of skin cancer.) Getting enough vitamin D may reduce, but not eliminate, your risk of catching COVID-19. (Source: a MedCram video citing a BMJ meta-analysis. Please see also this BMJ press release and this post.) Regular outdoor exercise may help you to get more sun and to synthesize more vitamin D.

There are other ways to get vitamin D, such as from daily pills; but the details are beyond the scope of this post.

"My first question is that most sources say to contact doctor regarding tests if you have “shortness of breath”, but as a Asthma patient this is not uncommon for me. Also runny nose is common. So how would an Asthma patient discern Covid19 from regular symptoms, only fever?
","There are apps to help you distinguish Covid-19 versus other diseases so in your question your mention a runny nose which is a rare or infrequent manifestation of covid-19.

Shortness of breath is a more advanced symptom than cough whereas in asthma shortness of breath is usual.

Furthermore shortness of breath in asthma is due to reversible narrowing of small airways so that should respond to usual bronchodilator medication.  But the shortness of breath in Covid-19 is at the alveolar level beyond the small airways and will not be helped by bronchodilator therapy.

In short, if an asthma patient has shortness of breath, fever, and cough where the shortness of breath does not respond to bronchodilator therapy, then in the context of the current covid-19 pandemic there is a high probability that this is covid-19 disease.

"The severity of n=44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Mainland China as of February 11, 2020** as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 (previously 2019-nCoV) virus is as follows:


81% mild (assumed: no hospitalisation)
14% severe (assumed: hospitalisation) 
5% critical (assumed: hospitalisation in ICU)


According to several news items on the media developing pneumonia is a common complication for patients with COVID-19. But how likely is it to develop pneumonia as a result of COVID-19? Does critical (5%) mean all those patients have pneumonia? 

I understand that many factors might increase or decrease the chance of developing pneumonia (such as preexisting lung diseases, age, environment) but I'm searching for the total percentage COVID-19 patients that develop pneumonia.

** http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51
","From your own data 19% of patients need hospital care.  Hospital care is usually required when the patient develops significant shortness of breath.  Shortness of breath implies hypoxemia.  Hypoxaemia is caused by a disturbance of gas exchange in the lungs.  All of these patients have pneumonia with the early CT changes of upper peripheral parts of the lungs showing ground glass opacities which then spread to show more extensive ground glass changes with haloing and areas of consolidation which merge into a whiteout of the lungs.

The Chinese CDC report has a slightly different definition


  The authors of the Chinese CDC report divided the clinical manifestations of the disease by there (sic) severity:
  
  Mild disease: non-pneumonia and mild pneumonia; this occurred in 81% of cases.
  
  Severe disease: dyspnea, respiratory frequency ≥ 30/min, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤ 93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio or P/F [the ratio between the blood pressure of the oxygen (partial pressure of oxygen, PaO2) and the percentage of oxygen supplied (fraction of inspired oxygen, FiO2)] &lt; 300, and/or lung infiltrates > 50% within 24 to 48 hours; this occurred in 14% of cases.
  
  Critical disease: respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) or failure (MOF); this occurred in 5% of cases.[12]


The decision to move from high flow oxygen (nasal cannula) to masks and then ventilation (proning) is based on standard protocols for viral pneumonia. ECMO is used when even ventilation is unable to maintain satisfactory oxygen levels.

Covid-19 has an odd characteristic of patients with mild hypoxemia suddenly compensating and needing to be rapidly intubated.  As a side note, intubating these patients is one of the most risky of procedures for medical personnel as it places them into very close proximity to a very sick patient who is expelling lots of virus.

"What preventative measures should people take to avoid infecting others that they are in contact with, such as family members, who are more vulnerable (elderly and/or individuals with underlying health conditions) to the virus?

In particular, what should be done when someone needs to leave home regularly for work, despite having contact with vulnerable people at home?
","If your relative stays at home without contact with anyone from the outside world, they have zero risk of getting the disease.  If a  relative living in the house needs to leave daily they risk exposure and getting the infection.  The relative at home now has a non-zero risk of getting infected.

If the relative at home is independent then they should be left to live alone, and the working relative move in with someone else.  If that's not possible, then another person not known to be infected should move in with her, and the working relative moves out.

If the working relative is the main carer for the relative at home, and the above choices are not possible, then they have to manage the situation as though they already have the virus.

The recommendation is that you are not going to transmit the infection to someone who remains at a 6 foot distance away from you, and if inside that distance for less than 10-15 minutes.  So, that stops viral droplets from one person passing to the next.

Viral nuclear droplets form when aerosols develop, eg flushing the toilet, so the toilet lid needs to stay down when flushing, and keep windows open.  Even better still use different bathrooms, or build a composting toilet away from the bathroom shared with the other person.  If you're not able to not share bathrooms, then all the surfaces needs to be wiped down with .1% solution of bleach after each use of the bathroom, and left to dry for 10-30 minutes.  Each door knob needs to be disinfected. There can't be any shared eating utensils.  And most importantly the hands need to be washed for a minimum of 20 seconds using a soap/detergent.

Even if people live together, studies in China showed that cross infection was not inevitable, but closer to 20% of households had transmission.

Would symptoms differ from eating virus contaminated food versus breathing in virus?
Would symptoms be a good indicator where the virus is located?
The COVID-19 causes respiratory symptoms and I guess that is because people are breathing in virus droplets in their lungs. But if you would swallow COVID-19 contaminated food and avoid breathing in the virus would that cause other symptoms like stomach pain or diarrhea?

","Well this is a guess because there is no published data that I am aware of in the english literature to be able to answer the question.

A small percentage of people who have presented with covid-19 pneumonia have also had diarrhoea, it is thought that the faecal-oral route is also an important mode of transmission.  

If the person develops a respiratory infection the affected cells will eventually spill virus into the circulation, a condition called viraemia. This allows the virus to reach distant cells that bear the ACE2 surface receptor and these cells are also in the heart, kidneys and gut as well as monocytes.  One would also expect that intestinal cells affected primarily by ingestion of virus particles would also do the same, and produce a viraemia leading to the virus spreading to the lungs, heart and kidneys.  But they may present initially with diarrhoea before getting respiratory symptoms.

"This page Bleach claims 


  Bleach is more effective at killing germs when diluted than when used
  straight out of the bottle.


this other page (Spanish) Alcohol and Bleach are more effective against Coronavirus diluted claims the same


  Disinfectants like bleach and alcohol alter the virus structure and
  prevent it from infecting us. Their effects will depend in the right
  concentration


But this other page, Does liquid bleach has to be diluted to be effective as a virus killer?

claims 


  So, all things being equal, undiluted bleach is more effective at
  killing stubborn bacteria.


I know, he says bacteria and not virus but, 


  The data of viruses is a little more straight forward � viruses are
  simply not cut out to defend against the bleach onslaught! A group of
  scientists in New York studied the effects of very dilute
  concentrations of bleach on the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). A
  tenfold dilution of bleach, which subsequently mixed with an equal
  volume of RSV-containing medium (so in fact a twentyfold dilution)
  eradicated all of the virus. A 100-fold dilution of bleach killed 100%
  of the virus half of the time, and decreased the number of live viral
  particles by greater than three logs in the other half of the tests.
  This was all after five minutes of treatment.
  
  So at least for viruses, you can probably dilute the bleach tenfold
  without worrying too much about decreased antimicrobial activity.


Personally, I don't find any logic why bleach would be more effective diluted, the opposite makes more sense to me. Is there any explanation for this to be so? Or it's just a wrong idea?
","The text does not say that more diluted bleach is more effective at killing viruses (or bacteria, or yeast, for that matter). 

I'm quoting:

...A tenfold dilution of bleach, which subsequently mixed with an equal volume of RSV-containing medium (so in fact a twentyfold dilution) eradicated all of the virus. A 100-fold dilution of bleach killed 100% of the virus half of the time, and decreased the number of live viral particles by greater than three logs in the other half of the tests. This was all after five minutes of treatment...

So a 20-fold dilution kills all virus always; a 100-fold dilution kills 100% of the virus 50% of the time and kills most of them in the other cases. 

I think form this we can conclude that more highly concentrated bleach is more deadly to viruses than more diluted bleach.

"It's been mentioned in another answer that

"This virus exits the cell using exocytosis after assembling golgi vesicles which contain the virus by fusing with the cell membrane.

In the case of infected pneumocytes, I imagine that the virus could then exit into the alveolus and infect other pneumocytes using again the interaction of the S protein with ACE2 or it could exit into the blood and spread to other pneumocytes in a 'miliary' fashion like TB. Is either or both the main mechanism of spread in the lung? Does lymphatic spread play any role?
","We know that early CT scan of patients, even asymptomatic ones, show ground glass opacities and histology of resected lung segments in asymptomatic patients taken for lung cancer resection show alveloli filling with proteinaceous material.  Patchy changes progress with time and if it were haematogenous spread then we would expect military like spread through the lung which is not what is being described.

The disease is spread by droplets full of virus, and it is likely that the patient in coughing is spreading the virus to other parts of the lung.

But this is speculative as the disease progression has not yet been fully characterised.

"For what I read [1], Covid19 can persist active in a common freezer for months or years (it seems pretty obvious: cold, humid...). My question does not regard only the currently active coronavirus at this posting date, but any.

So, I imagine that if the surface of a bottle or bag is contaminated, taking it, a month later will start the spreading mechanism, don't know, hands, surfaces, face, etc. And the virus will spread internally in the refrigerator, given that common refrigerators have channels that spill drops which flow through the cold and warm refrigerating sections. Or internal ventilators.

Under such perspective, a common refrigerator would act moreover as a Petri dish. Completely different from the rest of house surfaces, which would allow viruses vanishing way more faster.

If that is so, is it possible to clean a fridge from coronavirus? Do common refrigerators increase the risk of propagation?

[1] https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/ops/hsc-scen-3-coronavirus-3.htm (...""COVID-19 coronavirus could last up to two years at below freezing temperatures"")

[2] https://covid19.nj.gov/faqs/coronavirus-information/about-novel-coronavirus-2019/will-the-coronavirus-survive-in-the-refrigerator-or-freezer (""it is also expected that the virus would survive being frozen"")
","Since the virus replicates via human cells, how do you expect it to proliferate inside a refrigerator? And if you had human tissue (lungs, hearts, kidney, bowel) in your fridge, it still needs to be alive to proliferate as it hijacks the living cells intra-cellular machinery.

So, you're not going to get any more virus out than you put in.  Therefore if you disinfect before you put it into the fridge, you won't get any virus out.

If you're talking about the infected deceased coming out of the mortuary fridge


  There is no evidence so far of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the handling of bodies of deceased persons.
  The potential risk of transmission related to the handling of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or
  confirmed COVID-19 is considered low and can be related to:
  * direct contact with human remains or bodily fluids where the virus is present
  * direct contact with contaminated fomites.
  
  As viable SARS-CoV-2 may persist on surfaces for days [7], there is the possibility that the virus also persists on
  deceased bodies. Therefore, unnecessary contact with bodies should be minimised by those not wearing personal
  protective equipment (PPE). Those in direct contact with deceased cases of COVID-19 (both suspected or
  confirmed) should be protected from exposure to infected bodily fluids, contaminated objects, or other
  contaminated environmental surfaces through wearing of appropriate PPE. Minimum requirements include gloves
  and a long-sleeved water-resistant gown.

"
"Reading numerous news articles about COVID-19, I got confused as to what is its main transmission route. In particular, I am confused as to whether it is


direct landing of respiratory droplets in mouths and noses, 
contaminated surfaces,
aerosols (i.e., suspensions of the virus in the air rather than respiratory droplets quickly landing in mouths or noses or on surfaces), or
something else.


On the one hand, the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that contaminated surfaces are not thought to be the main transmission route:


  It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. (Link)


The same website appears to suggest that the main transmission route is  direct landing of respiratory droplets in mouths and noses:


  The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
  
  
  Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
  Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
  
  
  These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.


On the other hand, the World Health Organization (WHO), like many other agencies, puts the main emphasis on washing hands. Here is the WHO's first and foremost piece of advice on how to prevent getting infected with the virus: 


  Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. (Link)


Social distancing is mentioned on that webpage only as a second piece of advice, and, furthermore, the webpage implies that it is safe to approach coughing people as close as 1 meter away:


  Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.


Furthermore, I found an article saying that the virus wasn't detected in the air of hospital rooms with COVID-19 patients, but was detected on surfaces: 


  When researchers in Singapore tested the air in the rooms of three Covid-19 patients, they found no virus particles on cleaned surfaces or in the air even when they took samples on days the patients were symptomatic and presumably shedding virus into the air, they reported this month in the Journal of the American Medical Association. In the room of the third patient, who shed more virus, virus particles were present on ventilation fans and numerous surfaces — but all air samples were negative. (Link)


But the same article also says that Chinese researchers found COVID-19 aerosols near patients' toilets.

My question: Actually what is the main way COVID-19 spreads?
","The confusion exists because there are conflicting pronouncements from various authoritative sources but also conflicting pronouncements from the same authority.

Covid-19 is a respiratory infection spread by droplets that can be aerosolized (nuclear droplets) in certain situations such as by flushing toilets or in certain medical procedures such as intubation. However, it reaches the air it contaminates surfaces and this allows for the infection to be caught through the eyes nose and mouth with the virus being transferred from the hand.

The data from Singapore and Taiwan show that handwashing and social distancing are successful in preventing disease transmission. However, if social distancing is not rigorously enforced then you will need to wear a mask. The head of the Chinese CDC, Dr George Gao, has recommended that everyone wear a mask which is advice that contradicts most countries health ministries. This is so that the infected are not shedding as many viral particles into the environment. His advice is based on the fact that there is a high degree of asymptomatic infection in the community and these people are spreading the virus by droplets just by talking and exhaling.  The contrary advice is because they feel users are wearing masks to protect themselves, and, in the absence of training, they are almost certainly less effective at providing protection.  But trained users have a similar degree of protection with both surgical masks and N95 masks.

So the main way of disease transmission is by respiratory droplet. But the fact that health workers, NYPD officers (currently over 500) and others are getting infected wearing masks points to surface contamination as the second main mode of infection, or, possibly lack of training in wearing the masks and/or poor hand washing, or, that aerosol transmission is indeed important.

"In this link, in the section How long is it between when a person is exposed to the virus and when they start showing symptoms? mentions


  Recently published research found that on average, the time from exposure to symptom onset (known as the incubation period) is about five to six days. However, studies have shown that symptoms could appear as soon as three days after exposure to as long as 13 days later. 


I have seen this other link where we can see that the incubation could vary from 0 to 27 days.

Now here mentions how long it last if you have got it, which says its 22 days.



If the Covid-19 goes after 22 days, then could be possible that one gets it and showing no symptoms at all, not even feeling bad at all, the whole time on the Covid-19 process?  

If yes, is there a way to know that you already had it?

Thanks in advance. 
","Yes, it is possible to have no symptoms and be infected, various sources, e. g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32179137.

As for testing after 'clearing the infection', this would be what a serological scarring test would look for, e. g.: 


https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/27/serological-tests-reveal-immune-coronavirus/

"As specified in this link, COVID-19 tests start with taking samples from the nose or back or throat of people.

Based on growth rate of this disease, I thought what if those samples are not positive (showing infection with COVID-19), but that person has that virus in other parts of his body, because he's in the early stages of the infection.

So is it possible to be infected with COVID-19 and have no virus in nose and throat, and if it's possible, how long would it take to be certain that a sample shows the reality and a negative answer can be trusted?
","You are searching for the false-negative rate of these tests. A test resulting in a negative outcome while it should have been a positive outcome. 

A recent article stated that most of the false-negatives of COVID-19 tests are actually caused by not properly taking the samples from nose and throat. While I cannot find the original article I've got this information from, I've added two other relevant quotes. So yes false-negatives are possible but are likely caused by samples that are not properly collected.


  The rollout of COVID-19 testing is accelerating as more kits become available. However, a leading pathologist who was director of virology at Stanford, points out that the results are not 100% accurate. ""It's not that these tests can't detect virus,"" said Dr. Bruce Patterson. ""My concern is that the sampling involved in detecting the virus can lead to clinical false negatives."" - https://abc7news.com/6053940/


Also, the false-negative rate can vary based on the test method used and its quality and accuracy.


  COVID-19 tests are new, and assessing their accuracy is challenging. PCR tests may produce false negatives, failing to identify evidence of SARS-CoV-2. Sometimes false negatives result from human error or problems with the procedure. Giving the test too early or late, for example, can lead to a false negative. - https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-testing#accuracy

Can ultrasound have the potential to treat COVID-19 infected humans at large-scale (because it does not require anesthesia)?

I went through an answer on Quora. Is it a good idea to make a cavity with ultrasound for humans, specifically targeting the respiratory organs?

My apologies if this seems dope, I myself am an engineer, but this COVID-19 seems to affect the future generations as well so I thought of asking here. Please validate it.

"For this question, we will define surveillance as large scale random Covid-19 testing. 

It is my understanding that: 


surveillance enables the sorting of asymptomatic patients to be immediately isolated when infected (and reducing further infections).
the USA does is not applying said strategy

HBR indicates: 


  “Testing is the biggest problem that we’re facing,” Peter Slavin,
  president of Massachusetts General Hospital, said recently in a
  roundtable on Covid-19 at Harvard Medical School. While South Korea
  had tested about 4,000 people per million of its population at the
  time, the United States had just run five tests per million — despite
  the fact that they both reported their first cases at essentially the
  same time (on January 21 and 20). The discrepancy was surprising
  because the genome of the virus had been available since January and
  scientists had figured out the diagnostics shortly thereafter, using
  proven molecular methods first discovered in the 1970s.""


South Korea has a population of ~ 51M and the USA population is ~330M.

"
"There are four drugs being tested for effectiveness against COVID-19 in the SOLIDARITY trial.  Three of them have obvious potential mechanisms of action:


Remdesivir is an RNA polymerase inhibitor.  It might stop the virus from multiplying once it infects a cell.
Hydroxychloroquine may interfere with the spike protein the virus uses to attach to cells.
Interferon beta has general antiviral effects.


But I can't find anything that would explain why the Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination is expected to do anything.  Both drugs appear to be protease inhibitors that are fairly specific to HIV, while SARS-CoV-2 isn't even in the same general group of viruses as HIV.
","The NEJM editorial that accompanied that issue says:


  One antiviral-drug candidate is a combination of the HIV protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir. Lopinavir, which acts against the viral 3CL protease, has modest antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.


A quick search shows that SARS-CoV 3CL protease was the topic of some more in-depth investigations, including a theoretical Thai study of how of lopinavir might act on the 3CLpro of SARS:


  it was found that a mixture of two HIV-1 proteinase inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, exhibited some signs of effectiveness against the SARS virus. To understand the fine details of the molecular interactions between these proteinase inhibitors and the SARS virus via complexation, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the SARS-CoV 3CLpro free enzyme (free SARS) and its complexes with lopinavir (SARS–LPV) and ritonavir (SARS–RTV). The results show that flap closing was clearly observed when the inhibitors bind to the active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. 
  
  [From:] Nukoolkarn et al. ""Molecular dynamic simulations analysis of ritronavir and lopinavir as SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors"" J Theor Biol. 


It's ""above my pay grade"" to comment whether that makes any sense or not as a practical approach to SARS (or Covid-19) medication, but the paper  notes that lopinavir has a similar effect on the HIV protease:


  Similarly, this kind of flap (loop) closing was also observed when inhibitors bind in the active site of HIV-1 protease (Hornak et al., 2006a, Hornak et al., 2006b).


As noted on Protopedia


  Drugs that inhibit HIV protease prevent the virus from replicating, and are crucial components of anti-HIV therapies.
  
  The proteolytic active site of HIV protease is covered by two ""flaps"". It is believed that these flaps must open to enable substrate polyprotein to enter the active site. Drugs that inhibit HIV protease tend to ""lock"" the flaps closed.


So I think they were/are hoping that 3CL plays a similarly vital role for SARS and Covid-19 virus replications, and so that drugs that close it will inhibit virus replication.

There seem to be other researchers who have considered this approach for the SARS-CoVs, so perhaps it has some merit:


  One promising approach is to develop small molecule inhibitors of the essential major polyprotein processing protease 3Clpro. Here we report a complete description of the tetrapeptide substrate specificity of 3Clpro using fully degenerate peptide libraries consisting of all 160,000 possible naturally occurring tetrapeptides. 


There's even a library-compound-search paper like that (i.e. trying to find molecules that would inhibit its 3CL) for SARS-CoV-2 out already (published March 26) by Chinese and Saudi researchers:


  The viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) enzyme controls coronavirus replication and is essential for its life cycle. 3CLpro is a proven drug discovery target in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV. Therefore, herein, we analysed the 3CLpro sequence, constructed its 3D homology model, and screened it against a medicinal plant library containing 32,297 potential anti-viral phytochemicals/traditional Chinese medicinal compounds. Our analyses revealed that the top nine hits might serve as potential anti- SARS-CoV-2 lead molecules for further optimisation and drug development process to combat COVID-19.


However, this latter paper also notes that there are some key differences between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 3CL proteases, so compounds that work against one might not be so effective against the other:


  results revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro receptor-binding pocket conformation resembles that of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro binding pocket and raises the possibility that inhibitors intended for SARS-CoV 3CLpro may also inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.
  
  To test this hypothesis, we docked (R)-N-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-N-(2-(tert-butylamino)-2-oxo-1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethyl)furan-2-carboxamide), a potential noncovalent inhibitor of SARS-CoV 3CLpro named ML188 [35], with the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro homology model. We also docked ML188 with the SARS-CoV 3CLpro structure (PDB ID: 3M3V) as a reference, and ML188 bound strongly to the receptor binding site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The inhibitor targets the Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) along with the other residues, and the docking score (S = −12.27) was relatively high. However, surprisingly, ML188 did not show significant binding to the catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) of SARS-CoV-2, and the docking score (S = −8.31) was considerably lower (Fig. S3). 


This paper also investigated (in the theoretical/computational sense) three other drugs of that kind that might work on the SARS-CoV-2 3CL: Nelfinavir, Prulifloxacin and Colistin. Nelfinavir is also a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV-1 and Wikipedia says it's also being investigated for COVID-19, but I haven't checked the details. Interestingly perhaps, lopinavir is not mentioned at all in this SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor screening study. I couldn't tell you exactly why, but it might be because there are at least six ""1st gen"" protease inhibitors used in HIV treatment (and some ""2nd gen"" ones) so they probably just picked one for this study as representative.

"How quickly would boiling water kill coronavirus?

There are numerous articles telling us to disinfect groceries - wash all packages with soap and water and then disinfect with wipes, also wash produce.

For example: https://www.healthline.com/health-news/worried-about-contaminated-groceries-how-to-be-safe

""... wiping down all packaging with a disinfectant before putting your groceries away""

""For fruits and vegetables, VanWingen suggests scrubbing them for at least 20 seconds with soap and water""

However, disinfecting wipes and disinfecting bleach as well as rubbing alcohol are all sold out and we may never see them again (until it is too late). And soap and water are not enough - plastic containers are covered with ridges and crevices (potentially filled with deadly droplets). Washing them all is impossible. 

But many of us still have running water and electricity. So, it is trivial to boil a large pot of water and dip all packages and even produce in it. But is it effective? How long to dip? I guess there were no study yet about modern covid-19 but there must have been some studies about older coronaviruses. Does anybody know?
","The accepted knowledge is that boiling water for 1 minute kills viruses.  However, that is not necessary for SARS-CoV-2.  Any food you eat is going to be cooked for longer than a minute, and packaging can left for a couple of days for the virus to inactivate naturally.


  The standard recommendation for boiling water is a FULL ROLLING BOIL for ONE MINUTE and COOL BEFORE USE. The term rolling boil facilitates communication and assures that an effective pasteurization temperature is reached to kill or inactivate waterborne pathogens. Some agencies recommend boiling for longer periods, but this extra time is not necessary and can cause unnecessary power demand and increase safety concerns.


For cardboard boxes:


  On cardboard, no viable SARS-CoV-2 was measured after 24 hours


And on plastics/stainless steel


  SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard, and viable virus was detected up to 72 hours after application to these surfaces (Figure 1A), although the virus titer was greatly reduced (from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50 per milliliter of medium after 72 hours on plastic and from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50 per milliliter after 48 hours on stainless steel).


So, it can last for 72 hours at least though at greatly diminished amounts of viable virus.  So, use soap/water to wipe these surfaces down. Soap disrupts the virus capsule, and also forms a surfactant around the virus so it can be dislodged from surfaces. Some people do recommend you wash your vegetables of unknown provenance in soap and water.

"Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic I was under the impression that viruses fall into two categories:


Diseases from which you recover and afterwards become fully immune. When reinfected with a mutated version of the virus, you do get sick again, but it's a milder form. (common cold, influenza)
Diseases which are impossible to recover from (HIV, HPV), so you don't really gain immunity


Are there diseases which fall into a third bucket: you do recover, but can be reinfected immediately with the same strain? Note that I'm not asking about whether or not this is possible with COVID-19 - this question is purely about other diseases that we know of.
","Seasonal coronaviruses come back year after year and we continue to suffer with them


  Researchers do know that reinfection is an issue with the four seasonal coronaviruses that cause about 10 to 30% of common colds. These coronaviruses seem to be able to sicken people again and again, even though people have been exposed to them since childhood.
  
  ""Almost everybody walking around, if you were to test their blood right now, they would have some levels of antibody to the four different coronaviruses that are known,"" says Ann Falsey of the University of Rochester Medical Center.
  
  After infection with one of these viruses, she says, antibodies are produced but then the levels slowly decline and people become susceptible again.


Similarly, the Herpes Zoster or chicken pox virus you recover from but when your antibody levels drop, it can reappear as shingles.

"(lay person here)

I have been following recent developments in DIY ventilator design, which are normally focussed on a contraption to send positive pressure in a controlled cycle. The counterargument against these initiatives is that modern ventilators are complex and do, among other things, aspiration of liquid from the lungs because patients are intubated. Intubation itself requires sedation for long periods, which brings it's own problems.  

Why is such intubation necessary. Why not have a well-sealed mask? 
","When patients have respiratory problems due to low oxygen saturation then you can supplement the O2 of room air by using high flow oxygen at various concentrations above room air using nasal cannulae or masks such as a Hudson mask.

When they are unable to maintain adequate oxygenation levels with a mask, and/or suffering respiratory muscle fatigue, they are then placed on a mechanical ventilator.  The cuff on the intubation tube is to stop secretions falling back into the lung causing aspiration pneumonia as usually at this stage the patient is no longer able to protect their own airways. 

Some people have tried CPAP devices to supply air under pressure but that has the potential disadvantage of aerosolizing virus into the environment


  While that measure could stretch the supply of ventilators and save lives, it has a major drawback. Officials and scientists have known for years that when used with a face mask, such alternative devices can possibly increase the spread of infectious disease by aerosolizing the virus, whether used in the hospital or at home.
  
  Indeed, that very scenario may have contributed to the spread of COVID-19 within a Washington state nursing home that became ground zero in the United States. First responders called to the Life Care Center of Kirkland starting Feb. 24 initially used positive airway pressure machines, often known as CPAPs, to treat residents before it was known the patients were infected with COVID-19.

"It's been said that SARS-CoV-2 can remain on surfaces up to 9 or 10 days. While I read that smallpox can survive out of a host even for years.

As much as I know, since viruses are only protein capsules around RNA strands, thus they are comparable to rocks or metals. Why do they die out of a host?

What happens to them that causes them to die? Do they consume energy and run out of fuel? Do they have mysterious half-life as in chemical elements? Do they have predators in food- chain and get eaten by something else?

Why a surface diagnosed with a virus today, is clean after X daya/months/years? What happens to viruses on that surface?

I searched this and I couldn't find answera for why. They only say how long it survives.

  Strictly speaking, viruses can’t die, for the simple reason that they aren’t alive in the first place. Although they contain genetic instructions in the form of DNA (or the related molecule, RNA), viruses can’t thrive independently. Instead, they must invade a host organism and hijack its genetic instructions.

  Viruses covered in “envelopes” have the most trouble surviving outside a living cell. On surfaces, the surrounding light, heat, and dryness break down the envelope, killing the virus. (Porous surfaces pull moisture away from viruses that land on them, accelerating the destruction of the envelope.) Most rhinoviruses have such envelopes; so do some influenza viruses. Norovirus doesn’t, enabling it to last longer in the environment.

"On healthline it's mentioned  a recent study that came out of Wuhan, China; it’s published on a website, but hasn’t yet been reviewed by peers.


  In the study, scientists looked at the blood types of 2,173 people who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and compared that with the blood types of the general population in that region.
  
  They found that in the normal population, type A was 31 percent, type B was 24 percent, type AB was 9 percent, and type O was 34 percent.
  
  In those with the virus, type A was 38 percent, type B was 26 percent, type AB was 10 percent, and type O was 25 percent.
  
  The researchers concluded that “blood group A had a significantly higher risk for COVID-19 compared with non-A blood groups. Whereas blood group O had a significantly lower risk for the infectious disease compared with non-A blood groups.”


In 'non-medical' or easy to follow terms/explanations, Why is that?

Why does blood type A is more at risk?

and Why does blood type O has less risk?

Thank you in advance
","In simpler terminology than used in the paper referred to, the observation has been made before that there is a blood group susceptibility to certain viruses, and that SARS appeared to affect blood group O individuals less than group A.

Group O individuals possess antibodies against the antigens displayed by group A individuals on their cells.  These antibodies, anti-A, interfered with the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the ACE2 receptor - like a form of neutralizing antibody or natural protection.  Their small studies suggested that Group O individuals had 60% of the risk of the full population and Group A individuals an increased risk of 120%.  AB Blood group risk ranged from 148-200% increased risk.

Whether that is clinically useful remains to be seen.  Could pooled immunoglobulin from Group O individuals help infected sick Covid-19 patients? Would any vaccine directed against this region of the virus be ineffective in Group A/B individuals because they would be trying to create a vaccine against self antigens?

"It is well-known that South-Korea has developed a powerful system of drive-through testing allowing them to test hundreds of thousands of person in the past two months. I was wondering whether the test-subjects all visit those testing stations on a voluntary basis (because they are worried about their health) or whether true random samples of the population are being tested, supposedly requiring a government order to have certain people take a test on a (semi)compulsory basis.

To summarize: Is SK conducting random covid-19 tests on sizeable random samples of its population? Is any other country with a major outbreak doing such a thing?

This question arose in my mind in the light of rumours that the covid-19 epidemic would have a tendency to create a pool of infected 10 times larger than reported because alledgedly the main bulk of the infected don't experience grave symptoms and do not seek out a test or diagnosis. 
","South Korea has adopted a highly technical and transparent approach to Covid-19.  By sharing where infected people have been, citizens can see if they have been in contact or near contact with the infected person, and then request a test.


  Since the first cases were confirmed, Korean public health authorities and local governments collaborated to precisely document the movement of infected people down to the minute. Authorities sought testimony, watched closed-circuit television, investigated smartphone GPS data and more, publicizing the so-called moving histories of Covid-19 patients. All local governments share information through websites, text messages, and media. Companies have developed apps that allow users to visualize the information. Koreans can now learn where infected people went, when they were there, and how they got there. If someone learns they might have been exposed, they can quickly visit a doctor and begin self-quarantine if they have similar symptoms.
  
  On February 4, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took advantage of the post-MERS reform and authorized an unlicensed Covid-19 test; the government went on to test an extraordinary number of people. By February 26, Korea had tested 46,127 cases, while by that point, Japan had tested just 1,846 cases and the United States only 426. Tests still remain hard to come by in the United States, despite the Trump administration’s repeated suggestions that widespread testing is imminent.


There are few countries as technologically advanced as South Korea that are able to adopt this approach without a wide spread lockdown.  And it helped that they allowed the use of an unapproved tests whereas in the USA the CDC blocked the use of independent tests which has lead to their current deplorable state of testing.


  Following the end of the MERS outbreak, South Korea enacted a new law in 2016 that allows laboratories to use unapproved in-vitro diagnostic kits in the case of a public health emergency.

  “Testing is absolutely critical with a fast-travelling virus like this,” says Kang. “We have tested over 350,000 cases so far – some patients are tested many times before they are released, so we can say they are fully cured. Altogether, we’re talking about one out of 145 or one out of 150 people having been tested so far.”

"If someone happens to catch COVID-19 when we're on the other side of the curves -- when deaths and new infections are slowing -- would their symptoms somehow be less severe?  

A milder fever?  A weaker cough?  

Sorry for the naivety in the question.
","There are about 8 common strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in circulation.  It appears to be mutating slowly based on phylogenetic analyses and each mutation appears to be the same in terms of clinical disease and lethality.

So, there is no expectation that if you catch the disease late in its spread that the clinical disease is going to be any different from any other time that it's caught.


  Now, more diversity is emerging. Like all viruses, SARS-CoV-2 evolves over time through random mutations, only some of which are caught and corrected by the virus’s error correction machinery. Over the length of its 30,000-base-pair genome, SARS-CoV-2 accumulates an average of about one to two mutations per month, Rambaut says. “It’s about two to four times slower than the flu,” he says. Using these little changes, researchers can draw up phylogenetic trees, much like family trees. They can also make connections between different cases of COVID-19 and gauge whether there might be undetected spread of the virus.

"A previous thread on Bioinformatics StackExchange citing an article by the Economist which references a cartoon of predictive outcomes by the CDC (Economist article on coronavirus) suggests a model in epidemiology using the ""basic reproductive rate"", commonly known as R0. Although I'm no bioinformatician, I imagine that one could tweak a model based on similar infections like SARS and HDN1. Yet, I found no models predicting or giving confidence intervals for the spread of coronavirus. I wonder if the the data is still too sparse, e.g. we don't know if it's seasonal (mentioned in the above thread) and we cannot infer the virulence.

Would such a model be reliable? If not, how many months of data would we need to reliably use a model predicting the spread?
","The original R0 calculation was developed in the early 1900s to model malaria transmission and is known as the Ross-MacDonald model so your idea is over 100 years old. The model was very famous for identifying the optimal strategy for malarial control by targeting the adult mosquito rather than the mosquito larvae. What it said was reducing the mosquito population and reducing malaria transmission were two different issues. So the bednet strategy is based in this idea and particularly spraying the inside of houses with insecticide.

R0 was famously used in the 1980s to predict the HIV pandemic when WHO thought it would remain localised in Africa. 

The problem with R0 and Coronaviruses is we don't know the asymptomatic population who could also transmit the virus. 

This population is potentially very large. Epidemiologists will attempt extrapolation from cruise ship quarrentine, eg the Diamond Princess where everyone is tested to understand this transmission parameter and project this onto the rest of the planet. Clearly this could have limitations or inaccuracies. The other issue I am baffled by is seasonal transmission and whether this will occur with COVID-19. 

One thing R0 of COVID-19 will identify is the latent period transmission which occurs before the symptoms, i.e. the incubation period. Essentially, people with cough/mild symptoms before they self isolate and become really ill with a lung infection will transmit the virus. In this context R0 will be/was very influential for understanding when to move between quarrentine and containment phases of the pandemic.

"I don't have any background in genetics and bioinformatics, so I ask you if you think that the arguments provided in the article The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2 by Andersen et al. are convincing. In particular:


  While the analyses above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may bind human ACE2 with high affinity, computational analyses predict that the interaction is not ideal and that the RBD sequence is different from those shown in SARS-CoV to be optimal for receptor binding. Thus, the high-affinity binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human ACE2 is most likely the result of natural selection...


I interpret this passage as ""if the virus had been engineered, they would have done a better job"". Is this interpretation correct? And if it is, does it sound convincing to you as a proof that the virus developed in nature?

The second motivation given in the article is the following:


  Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used


Again, do you think that this exclude the possibility of a human intervention in the creation of the virus?

Thank you for your opinions.

Edit: I am a fan of Occam razor, I know that the scenario in which the virus originated in the wild is by far more likely than the human engineered scenario. I just want to know if, given our current knowledge in genetics, would have been possible for some high skilled researchers to engineered COVID19 (without implying that they did this with any bad purpose)?

Edit 2: I share the concerns of the author of this post, that is, that the findings of the article are merely opinions and some of arguments are misleading. Anyone having a solid technical background can comment on this? China owns Nature magazine’s ass – Debunking “The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2” claiming COVID-19 definitely wasn’t from a lab
","In summary, the authors are saying the complete opposite of ""human intervention"".


  While the analyses above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may bind human ACE2
  with high affinity, computational analyses predict that the
  interaction is not ideal and that the RBD sequence is different from
  those shown in SARS-CoV to be optimal for receptor binding.


The interaction with ACE2 is taking place on the Spike protein (S) in both COVID-19 and SARS-Cov. The S protein is very different between COVID-19 and SARS both in terms of sequence and COVID-19 includes an additional furin cleavage site, meaning structurally it is quite distinct. The ""computational analysis predicts"" is difficult because there is no crystal structure for COVID-19 S protein therefore modelling ligand binding is essentially guess work, particularly as it comprises an additional (furin) cleaved domain. What the authors appear to conclude is that they cannot map ACE2-Spike binding of COVID-19 using an established SARS S protein structure. I assume they are homology modelling SARS-CoV onto COVID-19 S protein sequence data.  In my personal opinion there is no way to homology model an additional furin protease cleavage site (furin is a host protease) so it would be difficult for ""good fit"" to occur, but it is just my opinion and the authors may have established methods to overcome this notable limitation, e.g. similar phenomena occur in influenza. 


  Thus, the high-affinity binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to
  human ACE2 is most likely the result of natural selection..


Their conclusion of ""natural selection"" is not strictly accurate and should be ""Darwinian positive selection"", but its a small issue. What they are saying is Darwinian adaptation has occurred as opposed to ""purifying selection, i.e. conservation. Thus they are definitely excluding human intervention because that is not ""natural selection""


  Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the
  several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would
  probably have been used


They appear to be saying that if a synthetic virus was constructed it would be created using an established reverse genetics system, and all those produced to date look nothing like COVID-19.

The phylogenetics argument is always a stronger argument than either of the above (although my opinion isn't entirely objective).  Phylogeneticists have had a long history in opposing conspiracy theories, e.g. polio vaccination, HIV and the list goes on, so it is much more natural territory. An example of such an argument is here which @terdon helpfully pointed out.

Geeze, that's a lot of a nucleotides---I don't think that's just random.  I would guess that it's either an artifact of the sequencing process, or there is some underlying biological reason.

Question: Why does the Wuhan coronavirus genome end in 33 a's?
","Good observation! The 3' poly(A) tail is actually a very common feature of positive-strand RNA viruses, including coronaviruses and picornaviruses.

For coronaviruses in particular, we know that the poly(A) tail is required for replication, functioning in conjunction with the 3' untranslated region (UTR) as a cis-acting signal for negative strand synthesis and attachment to the ribosome during translation. Mutants lacking the poly(A) tail are severely compromised in replication. Jeannie Spagnolo and Brenda Hogue report:


  The 3′ poly (A) tail plays an important, but as yet undefined role in Coronavirus genome replication. To further examine the requirement for the Coronavirus poly(A) tail, we created truncated poly(A) mutant defective interfering (DI) RNAs and observed the effects on replication. Bovine Coronavirus (BCV) and mouse hepatitis Coronavirus A59 (MHV-A59) DI RNAs with tails of 5 or 10 A residues were replicated, albeit at delayed kinetics as compared to DI RNAs with wild type tail lengths (>50 A residues). A BCV DI RNA lacking a poly(A) tail was unable to replicate; however, a MHV DI lacking a tail did replicate following multiple virus passages. Poly(A) tail extension/repair was concurrent with robust replication of the tail mutants. Binding of the host factor poly(A)- binding protein (PABP) appeared to correlate with the ability of DI RNAs to be replicated. Poly(A) tail mutants that were compromised for replication, or that were unable to replicate at all exhibited less in vitro PABP interaction. The data support the importance of the poly(A) tail in Coronavirus replication and further delineate the minimal requirements for viral genome propagation.

Yu-Hui Peng et al. also report that the length of the poly(A) tail is regulated during infection:


  Similar to eukaryotic mRNA, the positive-strand coronavirus genome of ~30 kilobases is 5’-capped and 3’-polyadenylated. It has been demonstrated that the length of the coronaviral poly(A) tail is not static but regulated during infection; however, little is known regarding the factors involved in coronaviral polyadenylation and its regulation. Here, we show that during infection, the level of coronavirus poly(A) tail lengthening depends on the initial length upon infection and that the minimum length to initiate lengthening may lie between 5 and 9 nucleotides. By mutagenesis analysis, it was found that (i) the hexamer AGUAAA and poly(A) tail are two important elements responsible for synthesis of the coronavirus poly(A) tail and may function in concert to accomplish polyadenylation and (ii) the function of the hexamer AGUAAA in coronaviral polyadenylation is position dependent. Based on these findings, we propose a process for how the coronaviral poly(A) tail is synthesized and undergoes variation. Our results provide the first genetic evidence to gain insight into coronaviral polyadenylation.

This builds upon prior work by Hung-Yi Wu et al, which showed that the coronaviral 3' poly(A) tail is approximately 65 nucleotides in length in both genomic and sgmRNAs at peak viral RNA synthesis, and also observed that the precise length varied throughout infection. Most interestingly, they report:


  Functional analyses of poly(A) tail length on specific viral RNA species, furthermore, revealed that translation, in vivo, of RNAs with the longer poly(A) tail was enhanced over those with the shorter poly(A). Although the mechanisms by which the tail lengths vary is unknown, experimental results together suggest that the length of the poly(A) and poly(U) tails is regulated. One potential function of regulated poly(A) tail length might be that for the coronavirus genome a longer poly(A) favors translation. The regulation of coronavirus translation by poly(A) tail length resembles that during embryonal development suggesting there may be mechanistic parallels.

It's also worth pointing out that poly(A) tails at the 3' end of RNA are not an unusual feature of viruses. Eukaryotic mRNA almost always contains poly(A) tails, which are added post-transcriptionally in a process known as polyadenylation. It should not therefore be surprising that positive-strand RNA viruses would have poly(A) tails as well. In eukaryotic mRNA, the central sequence motif for identifying a polyadenylation region is AAUAAA, identified way back in the 1970s, with more recent research confirming its ubiquity. Proudfoot 2011 is a nice review article on poly(A) signals in eukaryotic mRNA.

"In one of the answers to another question about the corona virus a link was given to this phylogenetic analysis of the virus.

Can somebody assist a non-bio type here? It seems to show that the current corona virus split from a virus in bats. And that the same ancestral virus is also ancestral to several other viruses, some in humans and some in bats. 

Is my understanding basically correct?
","Overview
The central focus of the tree is to highlight the key biological concern of the new coronavirus, 2019-nCov. The key concern is the genetic similarities to SARS epidemic, and relates to the SARS receptor. 

SARS background SARS is endemic in bats (your BioRxiv tree partly shows that and this tree definitely shows it) and in the 2002 epidemic infected civet cats which then infected humans. More importantly it is then transmitted from one human to another. This is a consequence of the SARS receptor been able to exploit the cellular receptors in the respiratory tract of bats, civet cats and humans and use this tissue as a site of replication. The concern is exacerbated because the tree here shows SARS independently infected humans on two separate occasions, suggesting the cross-over has an underlying genetic basis, which is part of the ""SARS lineage"".

BioRxiv 2019-nCov tree Your tree shows the 2019-nCov has a recent common ancestor with SARS in comparison to the rest of the betacoronaviruses. This therefore provides some circumstantial evidence the receptor mechanism and ability to frequently crossover from bats and ultimately transmit human to human could be shared with SARS. At an evolutionary level (which is what ANY tree is supposed to reconstruct) it raises the question which common ancestor of SARS did the ""SARS receptor"" originate. I'd need to draw a diagram to better demonstrate this point, but I hope you get the idea.

The ""influenza receptor"" The analogy is with influenza virus and the entire epidemiology of influenza hinges around is sialic acid receptor of influenza and its ability to bind on to the cellular receptors in the upper/lower respiratory tract of birds, pigs and humans. The hypothesised mechanism is called the mixing vessel theory and is the classic epidemiological understanding of how new pathogenic influenza pandemics occur. If you replace ""birds and pigs"" with e.g. ""bats, civet cats and humans"" you get the idea why this could be scary. We don't the intemediate host of 2019-nCov ... but I speculate there must be one, unless eating Cov-infected bats is common in China.

Technical details of the BioRxiv tree The tree is a nicely diverse selection of the beta-coronaviruses. The authors have rooted the tree using the outgroups of delacoronaviruses and gammacoronaviruses, so it is a good robust selection of outgroups which can be used to correctly identify the direct of evolution of betacoronavirus divergence. In tree theory (its formal name is phylogenetics theory), extensive rooting is good and minimises artefacts.

One of the earliest members of the betacoronaviruses to diverge is MERS (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome), which form a single ""clade"" (all viruses share a unique common ancestor) and these represent around 50% amino acid divergence from SARS/2019-nCov. The selection of MERS in the tree from both camels and humans looks good. The selection of other betacoronaviruses looks great, I wasn't aware of the ""ruminant clade""  at all involving buffalo, cow etc .. infections and there was an associated human infection. There are loads of bat isolates of the betacoronaviruses throughout the tree, but we eventually arrive at the ""SARS clade"". The authors show that 2019-nCov is an outgroup to the SARS clade and shows a close relationship to one (BioRxiv tree) or two (this tree) bat isolates. Looking at the precise SARS clade (better shown in this tree) we can see loads of bat virus associating with SARS lineages. We therefore assume the reservoir to SARS and likely 2019-nCov is bat, moreover that the single ancestor to both viruses was a bat (it is called a parsimonious hypothesis). 

The one thing the BioRXiv tree omits, for example with regards this tree, is the diversity of SARS and in particularly the two independent origins of SARS, which is a weakness of their analysis, particular if this fed into downstream analysis. It is not to say the authors were wrong, but it was uncool. 

Word of caution my understanding is the divergence between SARS and 2010-nCov is around 15% and this is a quite a large amount of genetic divergence, even if both viruses share a most recent common-ancestor, form part of the same clade and receptor peptide motifs. Nevertheless there is sufficient amino acid divergence to generate notable differences in epidemiology, clinical symptom and transmission. 

MERS, SARS and 2019-nCov mortality rates It is worth noting that within the betacoronaviruses the mortality rates between difference clinically important viruses is very different. MERS has a mortality rate of 40-60%, SARS is around 10% but 2019-nCov is &lt;2.5%. The 2019-nCov mortality rate is still important given it has infected more and could potentially infect alot more people than SARS.

"Quote:


  We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein (S) which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag. Interestingly, despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence, 3D-modelling of the 2019-nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site. The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity/similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.

I know this is a preprint paper and it's not yet peer reviewed, but can someone tell me what the implications are if this is true? Does this mean that the virus is artificially constructed?

UPDATE: The article has now been withdrawn with the following note:


  This paper has been withdrawn by its authors. They intend to revise it

  technical approach and their interpretation of the results. If you
  have any questions, please contact the corresponding author.




This is very odd, and will require a rigorous investigation, but my initial reaction is one of scepticism. Considering just the 1st insert, the insert sequence is GTNGTKR, short at just 7 amino acids. A simple BLASTP vs NR did not find perfect matches to HIV sequences, but did reveal 100% identity across the full sequence length to >50 other short protein sequences, which could be spurious 'chance' hits of course. Many of the top 100 hits are against eukaryotic sequences, for example one is against Pristionchus pacificus, a type of nematode worm (see alignment below). Someone needs to do a proper peer review of this preprint before any conclusions are drawn from it.

UPDATE 1: Things are moving fast. There are now 10 comments under the preprint, all of them critical of the idea that these inserts are meaningfully similar to HIV-1 sequences for the reason I outlined above (i.e. short sequences with many hits against organisms from across the tree of life) and additional points, such as small insertions being quite normal evolution for RNA viruses. There are also similar critiques on twitter and biorxiv has added the following disclaimer header to their website:

I have never seen such rapid (and unanimous) post-publication peer review before. It is therefore already (just 1 day after publication) fairly clear that at least some claims in this study are completely false and there is no good evidence to support the claim that the 2019-nCoV have acquired sequences from HIV or evidence to suggest the virus is engineered.

"I have heard several conspiracy theories regarding the origin of the new coronavirus, 2019-nCov. For example that the virus and/or SARS were produced in a laboratory or were some variant of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), shipped via laboratory workers. 

I am well aware bioinformatics has debunked many conspiracy theories involving infectious diseases, an important one being polio vaccination programs in Africa were the origin of HIV, for example here. Likewise, numerous conspiracy theories on the man-made origins of HIV were similarly overturned using bioinformatic studies.

Do you have bioinformatics evidence that would debunk the current conspiracists about coronaviruses?
","The scenarios are impossible and would be laughable if they were not so serious. The evidence is in the phylogenetic trees. Its a bit like a crime scene when the forensics team investigate. We've done enough crime-scenes often going to the site, collecting the pathogen, sequencing and then analysis - (usually neglected diseases) without any associated conspiracy theories. 

The key technical issue is coronaviruses are zoonoses , pathogens spread to humans from animal reservoirs and phylogenetic tree really helps understand the  how the virus is transmitted.

Trees 


The key thing about all the trees are bats. Bats lineages are present at every single point of the betacoronavirus phylogeny (tree), both as paraphyletic and monophyletic lineages, one example is this tree of betacoronaviruses here. Meaning the nodes connecting the branches of the tree to the ""master-branch"", represent common ancestors and these were almost certainly bat-borne cornaviruses. This is especially true for SARS and - here bat-viruses are EVERYWHERE. 
The tree here also shows that SARS arose on independently on two occassions, again surrounded by bat lineages and 2019-nCov has emerged separately at least once, again associated with bats. 
Finally the tree below is a figure from BioRxiv Zhou et al (2020) ""Discovery of a novel coronavirus associated with the recent pneumonia outbreak in humans and its potential bat origin"" shows the 2019-nCov lineage is a direct descendent of a very closely virus isolated from a bat (RaTG13*). This is a really conclusive finding BTW.



Note, I don't normally present inline images, but it is such a nice finding (hint to reviewers) and BioRxiv is open access.

Conspiracy theory 1: laboratory made virus

Literally it would require someone passaging a new virus, with unknown human pathogenicity, and independently introducing all the earlier passages enmass across bat populations of China. They would then hope each lineage becomes an indepedent virus population before, then introducing the virus to humans. Thus when field teams of scientists go around using mist nets to trap the bats, buy them from markets, isolate the virus and sequence it they would find a beautiful, array of natural variation in the bat populations leading up to the human epidemics, that perfectly matches vast numbers of other viral zoonoses. Moreover, this would have to have happen substancially prior to SARS and 2019-nCov, because the bat betacoronaviruses have been known about prior both epidemics, viz. its simply not feasible.

Biological explanation
General Bats are a reservoir host to vast numbers of pathogens, particularly viruses, including many alphaviruses, flaviviruses, rabies virus and beleived to be important in ebolavirus (I don't know about this) and even important to several eukaryotic parasites. It makes sense, they are mammals, so evolutionary much closer to us than birds for example, with large dispersal potential and roost in 'overcrowded' areas enable rapid transmission between bats.

Technical
The trees show bats are the common ancestor of betacoronaviruses in particular for the lineage leading into the emergence of 2019-nCov and SARS, this is seen in this tree, this one and the tree above. The obvious explanation is the virus circulates endemically in bats and has jumped into humans. For SARS the intermediate host, or possible ""vector"" was civet cats. 

The theory and the observations fit into a seamless biological answer.

Conspiracy theory 2: Middle Eastern connection

I heard a very weird conspiracy theory attempting to connect MERS with 2019-nCov. The theory was elaborate and I don't think it is productive to describe here.

Biological explanation
All the trees of betacoronaviruses show MERS was one of the earliest viruses to diverge and is very distant from 2019-nCov, to the extent the theory is completely implausible. The homology between these viruses is 50%, so its either MERS or 2019-nCov. Its more extreme than mixing up yellow fever virus (mortality 40-80%) with West Nile virus (mortality &lt;&lt;0.1%), the two viruses are completely different at every level.

What about errors? Phylogeneticists can spot it a mile off. There are tell-tale phylogenetic signatures we pick up, but also we do this to assess 'rare' genetic phenomina. There is nothing 'rare' about the coronaviruses. The only anomaly is variation in the poly-A tail and that is the natural variation from in vitro time-series experiments. Basically we've looked at enough virses/parasites through trees, that have no conspiracy theories at all (often neglected diseases), and understand how natural variation operates - so a phylogenecist can shift the wheat from the chaff without really thinking about it.

Opinion
The conspiracy theories are deeply misplaced, and the only connection I can imagine is its China. However, the Chinese have loads of viruses, influenza in particular which causes major pandemics, but that is a consequence of their natural ecology (small-holder farming) allowing the virus to move between reservoir hosts. I've not visited small-hold farms in China, but I have in other parts of the world and when you see them, you get it. The pigs, chickens (ducks .. China), dogs, horses and humans all living within 10 meters of each other. 

Conclusion
Shipping large numbers of bats to market, bat soup, raw meat from arboreal (tree-living) mammals such as civets that are sympatric to bats. Then consider the classical epidemiology in light of the phylogenetic data, which is very consistent, a single picture emerges that coronavirus is one of many zoonoses which has managed to transmit between patients. 

Summary The fundamental point is the bioinformatics fit into the classical epidemiology of a zoonose.

*, Note The bat coronavirus RaTG13 predates the 2019-nCov outbreak by 7 years. It is not even clear whether the virus has been isolated, i.e. could just be a RNA sequence.

""They have found some 500 novel coronaviruses, about 50 of which fall relatively close to the SARS virus on the family tree, including RaTG13—it was fished out of a bat fecal sample they collected in 2013 from a cave in Moglang in Yunnan province.""

"When calculating how lethal a virus outbreak is, I've noticed that most sources use 

CONFIRMED_DEATHS/CONFIRMED_INFECTIONS


However, given that there are only 2 possible outcomes; death or recovery, wouldn't it be more logical to use:

CONFIRMED_DEATHS/(CONFIRMED_DEATHS + CONFIRMED_RECOVERIES)


Which formula is applicable to which situations?
","This may not strike most as a bioinformatics, but getting the key clinical outcome is essential in understanding the molecular basis of pathogenicity.

I think the mortality rate is over-reported. This is not to say the situation of 2019-nCov is not serious - it is very serious.

The two essential factors missing in your equation for 2019-nCov are:


Age. Mortality is likely skewed towards the old and very young
Seroprevalence. To identify the number of asymptomatic patients.


Old people have a weakened immune system (e.g. reduced T-cell response). The very young have an underdeveloped immune system. The problem is hospital cases are skewed towards those with severe infection, which is likely the old and very young. In 2019-nCov the first infecteds were middle aged men, but likely to be restricted to those exposed to the ""Wuhan meat market"".

Problem 
Asymptomatic ""spreaders"" are known in influenza and are suspected in 2019-nCov. Asymptomatics will inflate the mortality rate (because we're not detecting them).

Solution(s)


One solution is to conduct seroprevalence surveys. Serological surveys screening for antibodies (IgG) against 2019-nCov will identify asymptomatic patients, using the first formula you stated. However, would you seriously go around the general population in a 2019-nCov epidemic taking blood samples? Errhhh no.
The bio-statistics approach is to use a catalytic model and critical to this is the age of the patient. Catalytic models are a priori models that incorporates the age-prevelance profile of infection. By introducing the incidence and age of hospitalisation of e.g. the old and the young, the rest of the distribution, i.e. asymptomatics can be calculated by regression. This estimates the total population of infecteds and again you use equation 1 to calculate the mortality rate recorded by the hospital.
Mathematical models based on transmission dynamics. The problem here is the rate of transmission is unknown.


I would assume the hospital is the place virus-induced mortality is reasonably accurate.

The second formula you described works very well for Ebolavirus, no-one has ever heard of asymptomatic Ebolavirus. It would also work well for another betacoronavirus Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome. The key problem with 2019-nCov is we don't know the number of asymptomatic patients or patients with such mild infections they never report illness. 

Summary
In summary, I think the mortality is being over-reported if it is based on your equation 2. Equation 1, however, will also over-report the mortality rate.

Coronavirus is an RNA virus, so I was expecting the sequence to consist of AUGC characters. But the letters here are ATGC, which looks like DNA!

I found a possible answer, that this is the sequence of a ""complementary DNA"". I read that


  The term cDNA is also used, typically in a bioinformatics context, to refer to an mRNA transcript's sequence, expressed as DNA bases (GCAT) rather than RNA bases (GCAU).


However, I don't believe this theory that I'm looking at a cDNA. If this were true, the end of the true mRNA sequence would be ...UCUUACUGUUUUUUUUUUUU, or a ""poly(U)"" tail. But I believe the coronavirus has a poly(A) tail.

I also found that the start of all highlighted genes begin with the sequence ATG. This is the DNA equivalent of the RNA start codon AUG.

So, I believe what I'm looking at is the true mRNA, in 5'→3' direction, but with all U converted to T.

So, is this really what I'm looking at? Is this some formatting/representation issue? Or does 2019-nCoV really contain DNA, rather than RNA?
","That is the correct sequence for 2019-nCov. Coronavirus is of course an RNA virus and in fact, to my knowledge, every RNA virus in Genbank is present as cDNA (AGCT, i.e. thydmine) and not RNA (AGCU, i.e. uracil).

The reason is simple, we never sequence directly from RNA because RNA is too unstable and easily degraded by RNase. Instead the genome is reverse transcribed, either by targeted reverse transcription or random amplification and thus converted to cDNA. cDNA is stable and is essentially reverse transcribed RNA.

The cDNA is either sequenced directly or further amplified by PCR and then sequenced. Hence the sequence we observe is the cDNA rather than RNA, thus we observe thymine rather than uracil and that is how it is reported.

"I am wondering about an article in the Economist here:
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/02/29/covid-19-is-now-in-50-countries-and-things-will-get-worse
There is a graph there


The explanation is as follows
The course of an epidemic is shaped by a variable called the reproductive rate, or R. It represents, in effect, the number of further cases each new case will give rise to. If R is high, the number of newly infected people climbs quickly to a peak before, for want of new people to infect, starting to fall back again (see chart 2). If R is low the curve rises and falls more slowly, never reaching the same heights. With sars-cov-2 now spread around the world, the aim of public-health policy, whether at the city, national or global scale, is to flatten the curve, spreading the infections out over time.

I am having trouble with this. There are 2 curves here. First of all, I am not sure of the different processes that determine them. It says one is without measures. The other is with measures. But it also says one is with high R and the other with low R. Is R a fixed constant for a disease? Alternatively, is there some variability in R and does that degree of variation affect transmission? This is not explained or stated in the article and I haven't heard R described in this way. At best it is not written clearly in my opinion. 

In addition, does without measures necessarily imply high R? Is that what they are getting at? Also, it looks to me as though the blue graph goes to zero very quickly, basically when t is equal to the mean of the orange curve. That means that without measures the epidemic will end quickly (because it exhausts all the possible patients). 

Finally the areas under the two curves is about the same. This means that the number of patients is about the same with or without measures. 

Anyway, can anyone clear up any of this?
","R is a reference to R0, otherwise known as the basic reproductive rate, and means the number of new cases from a single patient infection. R0 has to be above 1 for a disease to persist. It is a classic equation which account for the probability of transmission against immunity. The y-axis is the number of infecteds, very poorly presented.

The idea is that R0 will be lower if there is containment (less people to infect because you can't move around), but will last longer, possibly because the number of naive patients (not encountered the virus) will be larger over a longer period of time. 

That particular graph appears to be saying that everyone at risk of infection will get infected with or without control measures (the surface area under the graphs is approximately the same*) and the only thing that will halt the virus is acquired immunity. If this is mainstream economic thinking then I beg to differ, albeit I note the source is CDC (again see note*). 

For example, all other respiratory viral infections are seasonal. If COVID-19  is seasonal containment is the right choice, because the window of transmission is limited.

*, Given this is of CDC origin I think either its a mistake, or at the very least was taken out of context, because the idea is that overall there is a lower number of people infected as a result of ""social distancing"" and that does not appear to be what the two curves show.

"I have spent some time studying RNA structures. While there is a range of interesting phenomena and functions that certainly deserve understanding from the scientific point of view, I have never encountered a practical use of this knowledge (in terms of disease diagnostics, medications, etc.) Have you? If a practical use of RNA structures is still in the future, what could that be? 
","Please look up flavivirus 'double loops' as you described them previously (post for ""Coronavirus RNA') and associated RNA secondary structure anomalies for dengue virus and associated vaccine (Butantan) and the yellow fever virus and its vaccine (17D). If you are aware of ""double loops"", we must be aware of the association of RNA secondardy structure and attenuated strains, i.e. live vaccines. The point is that modification of the RNA secondary structure is a key strategy in flavivirus attenuation. 
"
"I wish to investigate how a virus could be attenuated through targeted mutagenesis by investigating its protein mutations in order to produce an efficacious vaccine. Are there examples where the protein sequence of exisiting vaccine strains have been compared against their wild-type counterparts to understand the mechanism of virulence/attenuation? Secondly which viral proteins are the focus of such studies?

I am a computer scientist looking for a mathematical approach towards understanding the mutational parameter space of viral protein sequence data, for example through a mutational correlation matrix between vaccine and wild type protein sequence. This may have application for example to COVID-19.
","There isn't a vaccine for any coronavirus, and your question is generally about targeted attentuation, which is a complex area. 

The basic building blocks for any vaccine development is virological understanding of the proteins involved in pathogenesis. I will focus on covid-19 as an example here.

The majority of bioinformatics work is based around the spike protein as is wetlab vaccine development. This gene is immediately after the 20 kb of ORF1ab, including the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, its around 3.5 kb but it might be a bit bigger. The spike protein is a major B-cell (antibody) antigenic determinant and the cellular receptor sites are located within it. Your bioinformatics could ultimately focus on targeting these specific sites, in particular using antigenic (antibody) prediction algorithms. 

First you need some basic biology of spike and hydrophobicity prediction is a good starting point such as TMHMM here and consider the SARS spike protein structure for example here. Once you've a handle on those structures antigenicity scanning would be a next phase analysis and possibly homology modelling. This is because COVID-19 and SARS are closely related, but there are key differences. You finally consider the full range of amino acid mutations in current epidemic via NCBI.

At this point you would target a specific vaccine design strategy and have a clearer understanding on the approach you wish to take. Good luck!
"
"Is there anything known about the RNA structures of coronaviruses? More specifically - do they have any interesting known structures in the translatable region, like RRE of HIV or the double loops in flaviviruses?

Update
Here is a recent development on the side of structure prediction.
","To add a more complete answer: the current coronavirus is closely related to the SARS virus that caused the outbreak in 2004, and on which much research has been done.

Here is a general review of the coronavirus epidemiology, life cycle etc.

I haven't found yet any materials about the RNA structures in the translatable region, however the structures in the 3' and 5' terminal regions are well studied and are known to be crucial for initiating viral replication and for its packaging.

This recent article addresses in details the RNA structures in 5' terminal of human coronaviruses, whereas this older article describes the structures both in 3' and 5' terminals.

Finally, the interesting algorithmic developments for the link that I added to the question are described here.
"
"This is the BLAST tree of the latest coronavirus out of China. It seems strange that there is so much divergence from all the other coronaviruses. Is this expected of new diseases?


","The  evolutionary related group (clade) of betacoronaviruses you have identified share an amino acid homology of 85% and include SARS. I know this from the underlying tree published on BioRxiv of a broader group of betacoronaviruses, i.e. your data is a defined subset of the betacoronaviruses which all share a unique, single common ancester.

Lets call this group the SARS clade.

You have performed a nucleotide blast and asked NCBI to produce a NJ tree using 2019-nCov as the reference. I can tell this by the colour coding and the scale bar at the bottom right hand corner shows the genetic distance involved is reasonably larger than 15% divergence by amino acid data. The scale bar represents the number of mutations per nucleotide. 

In summary, your tree is essentially a subset of the broader genetic diversity of the one published, but there is there is a rooting issue. 

In your tree, the majority of sequences are from the 2002 SARS epidemic and the virtually zero genetic distance between them is simply because it is a rapidly transmitted outbreak. I didn't realize that SARS has two independent origins both initially from bats. This is quite scary. 


2019-nCov is an outgroup within the 'SARS clade' hence it appears at the other side of the tree, i.e. they share a more distant common ancestor
However 2019-nCov is not the most distant common ancester within this subset of the betacoronaviruses, i.e. SARS clade, this belongs to the two bat viruses ZC45 and ZX21. The program has made a likely rooting error (below).
Again the blast omitted the majority of the betacoronaviruses, for example MERS


Rooting issue the reason I suggest there is a rooting error is because the BioRxiv tree using a broad sample of the betacoronaviruses placed the bat strains ZC45 and ZX21 as outgroups to the SARS clade and 2019-nCOV was immediately within that, so in this definition 2019-nCOV is an 'ingroup' within the SARS clade, whereas your tree it is an 'outgroup'. It not a huge issue, but the location of the ""root"" is determined by the common ancester above it (sequences with &lt;85% homology) and in your tree those have been omitted. 

Generally, I like the analysis otherwise and gives an insight into SARS that I hadn't previosly been aware of.
"
"I am a researcher in high-performance computing (with very little bioinformatics background), and I am trying to understand what are the current biggest computational bottlenecks of softwares used for research on the topic of Covid-19 (testing, vaccine development, drug identification, etc...). 

I know this is a very broad question, but I am looking for the biggest common denominators. Said differently, if you could pick a few operations / algorithms / data structures to speed up Covid-19 research and they would magically run 1000 times faster, what would they be?

Note: links to books, papers, and scientific literature are very welcomed.
","I can only speak of drug design (and even then I am terrible at turning down the jargon).

In the case of drug design, this is pretty much plan C. Namely, none of compounds that entered clinical trial at the start of the year work (let's call this plan A) and none of the vaccines that are entering now clinical trial work (let's call this plan B although vaccination prevents so is a better solution). Clinical trials take a lot time as they need to be thorough (cf. the infamous thalidomide from the days with more lax testing)

There are several bottlenecks in drug design. These are technical based on our imperfect understanding of things, which results in less than ideal models. CPU time is not really an issue. Empirical validation is required at many steps along the way. This is greatly increased by automation. The XChem team at Diamond light source have done a fragment-screening against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease at an insane pace: things are changing fast!

Drug screen

There are many ways to make a drug. In one way, a test system was set up (a reporter assay) that gives you a measurable read-out, say mm of clearance of bacteria on a Petri dish (viability) around a cellulose dish soaked in different separated natural extracts —and you might find that Penicillium chrysogenum has a compound of interest. What you are doing is drug screen. Screening a large panel of compounds (of varying purity) does not necessarily require knowing the protein target.

Rational drug design

Fast forward to this decade and it becomes possible to predict the free energy release upon binding of a small molecule against a protein —mostly.

This requires a solved 3D structure of the protein by X-ray crystallography. Crystallising a protein is a tricky business, as a pure protein sample has to come out of solution in a folded form to form a neat lattice as opposed to just making unfolded gunk. What salt conditions work? Anyone's guess. Some have done deep learning on it, but the best solution is to have a robot try a very large range of combinations.

Once you have a protein structure you can predict what fits into the part that you want to target, say an active site or an interface. This is not done by simple cartesian geometric shape fitting like LEGO bricks as there are many molecular forces involved. So a mathematical model of these forces is made, called a force field. Many have been made, a lot of study has gone into these, but they are not perfect. It is all made worse by the fact that we cannot really model water properly —most models use a proxy (implicit solvent) or use non-polarisable water.
This is all while made worse by the fact that a protein is not static but wobbles (following the same mathematical models). So a ligand does not slot in really like a key in a lock, but has an induced fit. Modelling all this is accurately is problematic, but one can still try: calculating where exactly a ligand binds to a protein is called for which one gets energy difference upon binding. And one can try an inordinate amount of small molecules —Zinc DB contains 230 million purchasable compounds. This is called a virtual screen. One can even start with the natural substrate and ""weaponise it"" by adding chemical groups that do a chemical reaction that breaks the protein. However, a metabolite is very different from a drug (cf. Lipinski's rule of five) as the latter must cross membranes etc. But generally the accuracy is not great without multiple steps of empirical validation.

To improve the results from a virtual screen the most common approach is to do a fragment screen to guide it. This is to automatedly soak protein crystals with a large library of small compounds and see which crystal contains a bound hit. The hits can be expanded into bigger fragments in a virtual screens and the short list of compounds tested (these are not cheap) by soaking and crystallising again.
In the case of Covid19 virus, the cool thing is that this whole process is open in the aforementioned current campaign (Diamond is a government owned synchrotron and not a big pharma). What is really nice about this is that for the second cycle comp-chemists from everywhere have done their own guided virtual screen and have submit compounds (which you can see publicly).

It should be said that drug screens that are not rational design are still a thing. The recent antibiotic-discovering deep-learning paper in Cell]6 is such an example, although it should be said that it was a feat not only in AI but also in automated empirical testing.

Future

Automation via better and open software will definitely improve. With a small drive possibly from the dissemination of easy to use and to code off-the-shelf electronics, such as Rasperry Pis or Arduinos. But mainly with more complex machines such as the Opentron system (a python-controlled robot).

But indubitably where the greatest improvement can come is better mathematical models. Possibly even with deep learning. After all researches were amused last year-ish (2018 competition) when DeepMind ""won"" the protein 3D structure (fold) modelling competition (CASP13) and there have definitely been some really nice results in the field of docking with hybrid models. So deep-learning may still surprise us yet...

Lastly, open science will be a strong driver: using premade packages or tools on GitHub and code snippets from StackOverflow etc. will accelerate these.

"(First time posting on this SE, I hope it's not off-topic.)

I have a friend who lives in the Netherlands, let's call her Allison. Both her and her neighbor (let's call him Bob) live in an apartment complex owned by a therapy organization they are both patients at, and their landlord is also the owner of said organization. Bob has lived there longer than Allison.

Every once in a while (at least once a week, though sometimes a lot more often), Bob tends to be very noisy in his apartment, by listening to loud music or playing with a pinball machine (a physical, real life one, not a video game). This often also happens very late at night, which is obviously not allowed per contract, and the walls are incredibly thin. Allison has complained about this numerous times, as it prevents her from sleeping at night and her mental health is suffering because of it, which the therapy home was supposed to be helping with. The inhabitants of the other apartments don't hear any noise, as Allison's apartment is the only one that share's a wall with Bob's.

The problem: Since Bob is a therapy patient himself, the landlord and the therapists appear to be protective of him. Supposedly, he has his own baggage that prevents him from noticing, caring or remembering that he's being inconsiderate. While they don't explicitly condone him doing this at night, they barely take any direct action. Instead, they advised Allison to use earplugs, since the person who lived in her apartment before her never complained about this and they figured she may just be too sensitive. When the earplugs didn't help, they told her to message Bob whenever he's being too loud, because he apparently needs constant reminding that he's not supposed to do this after a certain time of day. Allison tried this, and it helped, but the silence usually only persists for a few minutes before being broken again.

On Allison's request, the landlord eventually agreed to order noise cancelling panels to be installed on the wall between their apartments. However, he only agreed to pay for the very cheapest ones available, which had to be shipped from China and are now being withheld due to the Corona virus. Furthermore, after it was clarified that these panels would need to be installed on Bob's side of the wall in order to have any effect, Bob suddenly expressed that he's not willing to put in the effort to do so. In other words, he refuses to actively do something to fix the problem he's causing, despite the panels being gifted to him (Allison has expressed willingness to invest into panels for her side of the wall out of her own pocket, just for added sound isolation, but as stated earlier, those won't do much on their own).

Recently, Allison's therapist started encouraging her to look for other apartments, all of which turned out to be substantially more expensive than her current one (given similar size and quality). Despite knowing that Allison's financial situation isn't the best, her therapist kept suggesting that it might be worth it to get some peaceful nights. Allison feels like this is rather unfair, like she's being punished for her neighbor breaking the contract and keeping her up at night, and that the landlord / therapy organization should put more effort into solving this for her, as the contract states that excessive noise at night is grounds for eviction. However, whenever she brings these arguments up, they keep getting dodged.

Allison tried contacting the police about this, but they dismissed her case as something that's out of their reach. They advised her to try something called a ""neighborhood mediation"", though Allison has strong doubts about the usefulness of such a thing, as the landlord and therapists have already tried mediating between the two of them.

Question: Is there any other way to resolve this issue? Can a therapy organization get away with catering to one patient's needs, despite that being extremely counterproductive to the needs of another patient, especially if the former is the one breaking the rules? Is it legal for the landlord to blatantly ignore a contract that was signed by all the involved parties and not take any action against one of these parties breaking it and strongly inconveniencing another one? And if not, how does one get him to take action?
","
  Can a therapy organization get away with catering to one patient's needs, despite that being extremely counterproductive to the needs of another patient, especially if the former is the one breaking the rules? Is it legal for the landlord to blatantly ignore a contract that was signed by all the involved parties and not take any action against one of these parties breaking it and strongly inconveniencing another one?


First, it is important for Allison to distinguish between the existing legal relations and each one's separate ramifications.

The therapist looks manipulative and dishonest when encouraging Allison to rent a more expensive place, since at this point it seems that the therapist knew or should have known that the situation involves the landlord (who coincidentally is the therapist's employer). At the very least, the therapist should have informed Allison that the therapist has a potential conflict of interest, and thus let Allison decide whether or not to rely on that organization's services. Here, the therapist failed to make due disclosure.

Instead, the therapist's acts have all the appearance of accommodating its other customer (Bob), and ultimately trying not to disrupt its employer's profits both as landlord and as therapy business owner. That conflict of interest sounds in therapist's malpractice and may even amount to [therapist's &amp; company's] fraud.

Regardless of whether Allison chooses to denounce the therapist and/or the business, she should ask herself whether a therapy organization with such practices is apt for continued treatment of --and the ensuing profits from-- Allison's therapy needs. One aspect Allison needs to consider is that her continued business there would weaken her arguments if she eventually brings court proceedings against the therapist or his employer.

Allison's tenancy is a separate issue. Allison knows better than I (and the public in general) the terms of her lease and the physical details of her residential unit, so only she can compare them with section 7.4.2 of the Burgerlijke Wetboek to assess whether the lack of quiet enjoyment is attributable to a defect of the leased property (article 7:204.2). Allison should assess this issue from the standpoint of landlord's possible allegation that """"the disturbance is caused by a third person"" (whereby the landlord would seek to avoid liability under 7:204.3). Depending on Allison's determination of the aforementioned issue, she would have a claim against the landlord for breach of contract, and/or against Bob for tortious conduct (6:162).

There are at least three reasons why Allison should follow the police's suggestion of neighborhood mediation. The first reason is that there has been essentially no mediation in Allison's dispute. Mediation requires a nonparty whose neutrality is not compromised when conducting the mediation. That has been missing here so far. Allison has only dealt with third parties (i.e., the landlord and therapists) who are first and foremost reluctant to inconvenience their noisy client Bob for fear of affecting their own business interests. Allison's belief that these people were conducting a form of mediation is mistaken.

The second reason is that, from mediation, Allison may pursue and obtain a written &amp; signed agreement whereby Bob promises to desist from his pattern of disturbances (ideally Allison would secure an akin sort of commitment also from the landlord). In the event that Allison subsequently needs to sue either or both of the parties for the continued disturbances, filing in court these binding documents (which she would have obtained through mediation) will ease Allison's burden of proof.

The third reason is that genuine mediation might obviate Allison's need to seek remedies in court. That is because it would teach both landlord and Bob that Allison is able and willing to take legal action if the situation persists or escalates, which might have a dissuading effect on them. Furthermore, mediation proceedings will give Allison some experience as to presenting her legal arguments in a more formal setting.

Courts in Netherlands may grant injunctive relief in situations like Allison's where the ongoing harm is not susceptible of being quantified in monetary terms. Allison may pursue that relief, which if granted would compel the police to enforce it each time Bob violates it.

"So I live in a city that has these organizers who are newspaper owners that are about to go forward with a huge event that brings people from all over despite the fact that I just saw the coronavirus numbers increase by 18 in the past 24 hours here in the United States.

If this event results in an outbreak in my city, is there a legal precedent for a lawsuit against these organizers? Has anything like this been done before?
","Lawsuits are only allowed for harms to a particular private individual's health that actually arises from the conduct of the person sued. You can't sue because there was an outbreak in your city, you have to show individualized harm to you.

To prevail you would have to make out a ""negligence"" claim. The elements of this claim are (1) a duty, (2) that was breached, (3) by someone with injuries, (4) that were caused by the breach of duty.

There are two kinds of duties. One is the general duty to use the care of a reasonable person to prevent foreseeable harm to others (a breach of this duty is called ""negligence""). The other is to obey statutes and regulations and ordinances intended to protect people like the person injured from the harm suffered.

If someone doesn't violate a statute, regulation, or ordinance, then one has to show that it as negligent to carry out the event.

There would also be an affirmative defense that the fault was entirely that of the victim by attending the event knowing of the risk.

I wouldn't rule out negligence liability for event organizers, but it is more likely that they would be sued not for holding the event, but for failure to use reasonable care in how it was conducted (e.g. not having face masks and hand sanitizer on hand).

"What can we do with those people who still decided to travel (for skiing, example) and causing huge problems after they return, even though they know the fact that corona virus (or anything new in the future) is deadly and already spreading around the world?

Update:

According to Phillip, I want to point out a specific country like Finland, with Finnish law, for Finnish people who traveled to Italy.

Update 2:

I asked this question because I think in this way: If you're drunk and going to drive, and because of your irresponsible action could lead to the danger for some (one, two, maybe ten people), so you will be punished, even when you have not made a scratch to anybody.

But then why do there are people who would do something which leads to the danger of thousands of people, free to walk away?



Of course, we can exclude people who do not know, and people who have important things to do.
","Communicable diseases are endemic to the human condition

Some places, times and situations are riskier than others but there is always a risk in widespread travel. Outside of disease spread, there are other risks in travel; for example, if no-one traveled at all there would be no motor vehicle deaths.

On the flip-side, not traveling has its own dangers; for example, you will not die in a house fire if you are in your car.

Of course, there are enormous benefits to widespread travel;  economic, cultural and personal - life is to be experienced after all.

If you stop the skier from skiing, then you have just damaged the livelihood of all the people who depend on tourism; the airline, the hotel, the bartender, the ski technician, the baker in the ski resort etc.

Everything is allowed unless it is prohibited

By and large, this is the way that the law works. It's legal to do anything you like. Unless it isn't.

It isn't illegal to travel to, say, Finland. So you can.

If the government (of whichever country) decides that the costs of allowing people to travel to Finland now outweigh the benefits then they can prohibit it. However, that is a political decision; not a legal one.

As for your drink-driving example, I am old enough to remember when it wasn't illegal to drive drunk, although I was too young to drive. Of course, if you are in Somalia or Kenya it's still legal. Also, what counts a drunk varies by country - you can have a couple in Finland but cross over into Russia and you are breaking the law. Why does Finland allow such recklessness? Because it's a political decision and politicians in Finland and Russia have reached different conclusions about what level of risk is acceptable. Same with travel restrictions.

"At the end of this video NY Governor, Andrew Cuomo, criticizes the CDC for ""not letting"" the state of New York and other laboratories test for COVID-19.

What did he mean by that? Does the CDC have some legal authority to prevent the State of New York and other private laboratories from testing for COVID-19?
","The CDC (Centers for Disease Control) and the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) are both US federal agencies that have overlapping authority over medical testing in the US. In general federal rules prevail over state rules, so yes the CDC can stop the state of New York from testing for COVID-19 if the CDC has not approved the testing protocol.

The primary reason behind the rules is to ensure that any tests provided to the public are reliable. A secondary reason it to ensure that the testing development process followed guidelines on medical ethics. There is a set of procedures for Emergency Use Authorization, but there have been widespread complaints that even that process has grown too cumbersome and time consuming.

There has been more extensive coverage of the CDC and FDA stopping/delaying testing in Washington state.

There is no need for you to ""consent"".

Consent is just one of the reasons that allows a data processor to collect your data. There are other reasons that allows the data processor to capture your data.

In this case, it seems of application the ""legitimate interest clause"", as it is in your university's legitimate interest to capture your activity in order to evaluate you.

Of course, that covers only the data collected that is relevant to that interest. They will certainly capture your identity and your answers, they may log your sessions and may try to gather some data to detect if you are somehow cheating, but they would not be allowed to check which are your favorite pornhub videos because that is not relevant for the university's legitimate interest.

Art. 6 of the GDPR states:


  Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:
  (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
  (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
  (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
  (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
  (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;
  (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.

"Right now there are large American states which have 50 times more Coronavirus cases in ratio/proportion than others, with hundreds of cases close to a thousand, and there are even small states where cases are zero or near to zero. Do American states have the power to close their borders from other states in a health emergency, is there a workaround to apply this, or can even the federal government give this power temporarily to states or something?
","US Constitutional law generally recognizes the right of freedom of movement, e.g. in  Corfield v. Coryell, 6 Fed. Cas. 546, Crandall v. Nevada, 73 U.S. 35,  Paul v. Virginia, 75 U.S. 168. 
The more recent case Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489 affirms the position that restricting the ""right to travel violates the Equal Protection Clause absent a compelling governmental interest"", and one of the specific rights subsumed under the right to travel is ""the right to enter and leave another State"".

The ""compelling governmental interest"" is a reference to standard of judicial review known as strict scrutiny, where a law that restricts a fundamental right (the right to travel) is required for a ""compelling state interest"", is ""narrowly tailored"" to that purpose, and is the ""least restrictive means"".

It is highly likely that each state has a statute that grants broad powers to the governor in case of a state of emergency. Such an order would then have to be scrutinized strictly, with respect to the narrow tailoring and least restrictive aspects of the question. We would then have to analyze the specifics of the case and order.

I really want to role this out in my local area (maybe larger area if I have the resources to manage it) but before I do I want to make sure I'm not setting myself up for some nasty legal issues. I would also like any recommendations as to what I can do if anything to the app to make it more secure and compliant) Thanks . I am in the UK
","Yes, GDPR applies:


you are a data controller established/living in the UK or are offering services to people in the UK
you fall under the material scope of the GDPR. The Art 2(2)(c) exemption for “purely personal or household activity” does not apply since you're offering the service to the public.


You must consider GDPR compliance here. This is especially important as you are showing personal data to the public. Don't do that unless you have a very good reason, appropriate safeguards, and are clear to users how their information will be shown.

On a high level, GDPR compliance involves working on the following questions:


For what purpose are you processing personal data?

Context: purpose limitation principle per GDPR Art 5(1)(b)
What is the legal basis for processing?

GDPR Art 6(1) lists the available legal bases. Here, consent, necessity for performance of a contract, or a legitimate interest could be a legal basis. They may have further obligations attached. A legitimate interest requires a balancing test that considers the data subject's rights and freedoms. Consent must fulfil the conditions per Art 7 in order to be valid.
What is the minimal data necessary to achieve the purpose?

Per the Art 5(1)(c) data minimisation principle, it is illegal to process personal data beyond what is necessary and adequate. You must provide data protection by design and by default per Art 25. Special categories of data per Art 9 such as health data are illegal to process outside of narrow exemptions. You must delete data once it is no longer necessary.
What appropriate safeguards and security measures should you apply?

Per Art 24 and 25, you are responsible for determining and implementing appropriate measures. This depends a lot on your specific context, so there's no checklist you can apply. Per Art 25(1) you must pseudonymize the processed information if that is compatible with the processing purpose.
What further compliance measures do you have to consider?

There are additional GDPR and non-GDPR compliance measures. From the GDPR side:


Use the answers to these questions to write a privacy policy, including the information that you must provide to data subjects per Art 13.
Consider whether you have to maintain a Records of Processing document per Art 30, or if you have to make a Data Protection Impact Assessment per Art 35. 
If you use third party services, figure out whether they are a joint controller or data processor and apply appropriate safeguards.
If you have data processors, ensure that you have a contract in place that covers the items from Art 28(3).
If you share data with other controllers (not processors) you need a legal basis for doing so.
If you transfer data into a non-EU/EEA country (after 2020: non-UK country) you need a legal basis per Art 44 and have to cover additional items in your privacy policy. Ideally, the target country is covered by an EC adequacy decision per Art 45. For US-based companies, this is the case only when they have self-certified under the Privacy Shield framework.


Non-GDPR compliance steps could include cookie consent banners, or showing a VAT ID.
How can you prepare for data subject requests?

Data subjects have various rights per Arts 15–23, subject to the modalities in Art 12. For example, a data subject could request that their information is erased from your website. The exact rights also depend on the legal basis you selected. You should figure out in advance how to deal with such requests.

"About a month ago, I signed a lease for an apartment (with two roommates who are renewing their lease) in North Carolina with a move-in date of May 15th. I'm a STEM graduate student, and with developing family finance concerns and the recent transition to remote everything both teaching and research related, I'm beginning to think it may not makes sense to drain so much of my income to stay near a closed university rather than move in with my brother.

To my reading, the lease agreement states that breaking with more than 6 months remaining will incur a penalty of 2 months' rent. Were I to attempt to back out in the next few days (well before the move-in date), could I expect the current national or state declaration of a state of emergency due to the Covid-19 pandemic to impact my penalty? In particular, is there any legal reason to expect that, due to the state of emergency, I could avoid the penalty altogether?
","In general, you are not freed of contractual obligations if your circumstances change, whether that is because of economic downturn / unemployment, weather, or disease. If there is a clause in the lease saying ""this lease can be voided if tenant {becomes unemployed / contracts a disease....}"" then that could cover your circumstances (I would be stunned if there were such a clause). There is a separate question, whether an exemption might arise if the government forbids you to move. The existence of a legal ""state of emergency"" has limited implications for legal rights and obligations – mostly, it empowers the government to restrict your rights. There is no effect on your responsibilities.

"In response to the rapidly spreading coronavirus, Germany has enacted a general ""ban on contact"", effective starting today (Monday, 2020-03-23). It prohibits any gathering of more than two people in public and private spaces, except if they live in the same household.

What I am very unclear about is the extent to which certain behaviours are restricted by this regulation, as coverage in news is IMHO extremely unclear.

For instance, Berliner Morgenpost says:


  Gruppen feiernder Menschen auf öffentlichen Plätzen, in Wohnungen sowie privaten Einrichtungen sind angesichts der ernsten Lage in unserem Land inakzeptabel.


In English:


  Groups of partying people in public spaces, in apartments, as well as private facilities are inacceptable due to the serious situation in our country.


Tagesschau says:


  Gruppen feiernder Menschen - auch im Privaten - sind inakzeptabel


In English:


  Groups of celebrating people - also in private - are inacceptable


And Merkur.de says:


  „Gruppen feiernder Menschen sind inakzeptabel“, erklärten die Politiker unisono. Jegliche Feierlichkeiten sind untersagt, das gilt auch für Geburtstage.


In English:


  ""Groups of celebrating people are inacceptable."", the politicians explained in unison. Any kind of celebrations are prohibited, this includes birthdays.


Now, what does this mean? At least some of the above statements can be interpreted in such a way that it's about the physically close group aspect. That is, celebrations whose participants meet in person in the same place are prohibited.

But then, all of those statements, and definitely the last one, also sound a lot like it's the very activity of celebrating that is prohibited, presumably because the ""serious situation in our country"" makes such a behaviour unbecoming. Thus, it sounds like restrictions similar to the Tanzverbot (that declare various overtly joyful activities to be unbecoming and thus unlawful on certain holidays) are in place.

Which interpretation is correct?


Am I violating the newly imposed restrictions if I meet with some of my friends (each of which is sitting at home alone, or at most with their families) via videochat and ""celebrate"" (whatever is meant by that, let's count any joyful or relaxing leisure activity) with them online to brace against the effects of social isolation and cabin fever?
And does it mean we cannot let our children have a joyful videochat with their friends whom they already cannot meet in person due to the closure of schools and child nurseries?

","What most of your quotes are based on is this general consensus reached by the federal and state governments on how to proceed.
The actually legal implementation happens on the state level in form of decrees.
Therefore, the quoted texts are not to be taken as legal text, but human-readable¹. In particular they are not to be taken painstakingly literal, but context and common sense may be applied².

The actual decrees are much more specific and clear.
For example, let’s take the decree for Northrhine-Westphalia (translation mine):


  § 11 Veranstaltungen, Versammlungen, Gottesdienste, Beerdigungen
  
  (1) Veranstaltungen und Versammlungen sind untersagt. Ausgenommen sind […]
  
  § 12 Ansammlungen, Aufenthalt im öffentlichen Raum
  
  (1) Zusammenkünfte und Ansammlungen in der Öffentlichkeit von mehr als 2 Personen sind untersagt. Ausgenommen sind […]
  
  
  
  § 11 Events, gatherings, religious services, funerals
  
  (1) Events and gatherings are forbidden. Exempt are […]
  
  § 12 Gatherings and presence in public space
  
  (1) Congregations and gatherings of more than two persons in public are forbidden. Exempt from this are […]


Most of this is clearly about in-person meetings.
The only exception is the term “Veranstaltung” (event), which could be construed to cover online events.
However, in other laws using this term, it clearly refers to in-person events.
For example parts of this law governing the number of toilets available at an event do not make any sense for online events.

I see nothing in the decree that would forbid online celebrations. In fact celebrations are not mentioned at all (and are covered by more general terms in the degree, as far as they are in-person).




¹ To be fair, the actual legal texts are not that bad in terms in human readability either.
² Mind that I do not wish to accuse you of lacking common sense here. After all the consensus dissonating with your common sense made you ask this question.

"I am currently laid off from my job due to the Coronavirus outbreak. My employer informed my coworkers and I in a group meeting on the day before the lay-off that we would all be brought back to work when it is safe to do so.

If my employer was to not bring me back to work after the outbreak is over, perhaps citing a work performance issue or something along those lines, can I sue them for wrongful termination after they verbally promised all of us that we would all have our jobs after the Coronavirus outbreak is over?
","People are laid off all the time when sales are down, the market is bad, etc: there is no legal ""right to a job"" except whatever is in your employment contract. There is a legal concept of promissory estoppel which boils down to promises being binding. However, there has to be a clear and definite promise, not for example a statement like ""we hope to bring you back after this is over"". 

Normally, the employer can argue that they have the right to fire you regardless of performance, and that would be the end of it. Let's say you have it in writing, and it is clear that they unconditionally promise to hire you back: you would want to (e)stop them from arguing that they have the right to fire you. The underlying idea of promissory estoppel is that such a promise keeps them from making that argument. But: it is not enough that they made the promise, you also had to rely on the promise and act / forbear from acting in some way because of that promise. It could be, for example, taking another job, or moving to another country, or simply looking for another job. The hard part, then, would be getting a clear and definite promise.

"My wife and I are moving out of our current rental in a couple of weeks.  Our landlord stated in a text this morning that he can show our house to potential new renters with 24 hours notice, even though we asked him to wait until we have moved out -- my wife has asthma, and we're in the upswing of a global pandemic.  

We live in Arizona.  Are there any state or federal laws, or executive orders, that allow us to keep our landlord out until we've left?
","ARS 33-1343 allows the landlord to show the place, with two days notice. None of the executive orders suspend this aspect of the law: the eviction order is directed at law enforcement, and orders a temporary delay in enforcement of eviction orders. The governor does not have clear constitutional or statutory authority to suspend all or part of ARS 33-1343. The initial declaration of emergency lists the various statutory authorities, such as ARS 36-787. In order to suspend the landlord access law, the legislative would have to enact a new law, which the governor would have to sign into law. There is no applicable federal order, and any such order would be of dubious constitutionality (landlord-tenant laws are a state matter, not a federal matter).

"The government has issued guidelines saying that we must stay inside.  I understand this has now passed into law.  Can anyone please point me to a copy of the legislation, and point out which sections are the relevant ones?
","The Coronavirus Act 2020.  Specifically Schedule 21 which relates to control of potentially infectious persons and Schedule 22 which limits gatherings and other aspects.

The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020.  Specifically Regulation 6, which relates to restriction on movement.

"Many state governments have declared temporary ""shelter in place"" statutes due to Covid-19 that restrict unnecessary travel by vehicle. I know this will vary by jurisdiction: but generally, is the suspicion of unnecessary travel sufficient probable cause for a traffic stop and questioning the driver and passengers as to the nature of the travel? Is probable cause not necessary under these temporary ""shelter in place"" statutes?
","A reasonable suspicion for a Terry stop has to be based on ""specific and articulable facts"", and not based just on a hunch. A mere ""feeling"" that a person may be traveling unnecessarily would not legitimize a stop, but some concrete evidence could. For example, 8 teenagers in a car repeated driving a loop experientially looks like cruising, which is not in the category of necessary travel. 8 70 year olds doing the same is probably about as out of the ordinary, even if you can rationalize it as confused elders.

"Apparently, a new coronavirus related paid family leave law takes effect on 04/01/2020. I understand that, among commercial companies, it applies only to those under 500 employees (because, of course, companies that can afford lobbying cannot be burdened, but that's unrelated to the question.) The questions I have regarding that law:

1) Does the new extended leave law apply to federal employees? More specifically, my wife works for Veterans' Affairs, and we'd like to figure out whether she qualifies. On one hand, VA has more than 500 employees, but on the other hand, VA is not a commercial company, and I don't see in the reports specifics regarding the government employees.

2) Would a mother of small children qualify for paid family leave to watch them while the schools are closed? This has become quite an issue as soon as the schools closed for the year.
","The Department of Labor has a page about the law.  Some excerpts (boldface mine):


  Most employees of the federal government are covered by Title II of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which was not amended by this Act, and are therefore not covered by the expanded family and medical leave provisions of the FFCRA. However, federal employees covered by Title II of the Family and Medical Leave Act are covered by the paid sick leave provision. 


And as to your Question 2:


  Generally, the Act provides that employees of covered employers are eligible for:
  
  Two weeks (up to 80 hours) of paid sick leave at two-thirds the employee’s regular rate of pay because the employee is unable to work because of a bona fide need to care for an individual subject to quarantine (pursuant to Federal, State, or local government order or advice of a health care provider), or to care for a child (under 18 years of age) whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19, and/or the employee is experiencing a substantially similar condition as specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretaries of the Treasury and Labor; and
  
  Up to an additional 10 weeks of paid expanded family and medical leave at two-thirds the employee’s regular rate of pay where an employee, who has been employed for at least 30 calendar days, is unable to work due to a bona fide need for leave to care for a child whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19.

"I am wondering if Americans have a constitutional right to decline being tested for the COVID-19 virus.

Consider a scenario in which the state police create a checkpoint on an interstate highway and begin administering a COVID-19 screening test on every person in every car that goes through this checkpoint. Do Americans have a constitutional right to decline being tested and be allowed to pass through this checkpoint, or does a national crisis/emergency negate an American's constitutional rights and thus every person must comply with being tested?

EDIT

To help clarify my inquiry, what I particularly would like to know is if you are directed to exit your vehicle by a state trooper at this highway checkpoint so a doctor/nurse there can administer a test on you to see if you have COVID-19, can you decline to exit your vehicle and also decline undergoing this medical test? Do Americans have a Constitutional right to decline complying with such a directive?
","It is difficult to keep track of the rapidly changing legal variables, but it would be illegal and unconstitutional for state police to set up an unauthorized stop-and-search checkpoint on the road (""due process"" means ""following the law""). As a prelude, there would have to be some higher authority that empowers them to do this. You would have to scrutinize the emergency powers legislation of every state to be certain, but no governor has the power to mandate blanket body searches in case of a medical emergency. (Martial law shifts enforcement of the law to the military, but doesn't generally create arbitrary decree-writing powers).

The legal foundation of such searching would have to be a new law: then the question is what the law requires that could make on-the-road body searches constitutional. Since the right to be free of unreasonable searches is a fundamental constitutional right, this law would be reviewed under strict scrutiny. Searches ""just for fun"" will not pass such scrutiny, nor will ""because it's an emergency"" or ""keep the public safe"". Having the disease is not and cannot be a crime, so this law would have to be founded on a strict no-travel requirement. That brings the matter within the sphere of the ""officer safety"" exception in the case of an arrest. I'm not suggesting that an absolute travel ban would be upheld as constitutional in the US, but that is the kind of legal foundation that would be required for state police to force people to be Covid-searched.

"I own a condo apartment in Schaumburg Illinois. The tenant has lost her job because of COVID-2019 and is unable to pay the rent. I however have to pay the monthly installments as mortgage for this house.

What are the options for me? Can i terminate the lease which currently ends on October 2020? Is there a law where i can evict the tenant?
","Any eviction order (for non-payment) will not be enforced by the sheriff (as ordered by the court), and that is how evictions would happen. This is also required under the governor's order of March 20. Foreclosure entails eviction – though the order prohibits the enforcement of an associated eviction order, and doesn't prohibit starting action against a property owner. Theoretically, you could file for eviction against your tenant and at some point the petition could be granted, and the sheriff would enforce it. Those are the current legal options. Current (optimistic) projections are that evictions could happen in the second half of May.

"During the current Coronavirus lockdown in the UK (England), is it legal for me to:


  a) Drive for over one hour (alone) to reach the start of my walk.
  
  b) Walk for 4-5 hours (alone) keeping at least 2m away from other people.
  
  c) Drive home again.


The law seems to say that I am allowed to leave my house for exercise but does not stipluate how long this should take.  It also does not state that use of a car is not allowed.

Edit:

Yes, this question is against the ""spirit"" of the law, but that is not the question being asked, if we get into the morality of it then we have to start taking peoples rights into consideration, one of those rights is to go where they want and to do what they want, even if that means that someone else suffers in some way.  People have fought and died for our rights over hundreds of years, you cannot just ignore that.
","There is no clear answer, and I suspect an argument could be made either way. 

The relevant regulations in this case are The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020. In particular, regulation 6(1) states that:


  6.—(1) During the emergency period, no person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse.


In this case, you would be relying on the reasonable excuse given in regulation 6(2)(b):


  (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), a reasonable excuse includes the need—[...]
  (b) to take exercise either alone or with other members of their household;


The regulations do not explicitly state:


how far you may travel for the purposes of exercise,
how long you may exercise for
even, in contrast with government advice, how many times a day you may leave your house for exercise.


It would require the interpretation of the courts to decide whether travelling for long distances was reasonable in order to take exercise, and whether exercising for many hours is reasonable. Michael Gove stated in an interview that:


  I would have thought that for most people, a walk of up to an hour, or a run of 30 minutes or a cycle ride of between that, depending on their level of fitness is appropriate.


This is of course not law, but opinion; yet it is worth keeping in mind that the courts may take a similar view to this.

A strong argument could be made to say that this scenario is not in fact necessary exercise, but leisure, which is not considered a reasonable excuse in the regulations. Equally, it could be argued that the regulations do support travel for exercise in any form. I don't think anyone could answer with certainty whether this is legal or not, until the law is tested on this point.

"I am wondering if ICE has the legal authority to immediately arrest illegal immigrants after they have received medical care at U.S. hospitals for COVID-19. I am referring to people who voluntarily came into U.S. hospitals to receive this medical treatment. 

Moreover, if ICE does have the legal authority to do this, do the mayors of sanctuary cities currently have a legal right to intervene to stop ICE from arresting these particular illegal immigrants? I am thinking in particular about the mayors of cities throughout the state of California.
","ICE has a degree of authority to deport without court hearing, via an expedited process. The legal framework for such deportations are explained here, and rely on  8 USC 1225. The Secretary of DHS has authority to establish rules, and has recently done so here. The current regulations pertaining to expedited removal are at 8 CFR 253.3. There is no exemption for people being medically treated, for covid-19 or any other reason, but ""parole"" is available (at the discretion of the attorney general) to ""parole"" an immigrant if it is ""is required to meet a medical emergency"". Thus an illegal immigrant in the ICU might be exempt from immediate deportation, but that is at the discretion of the AG. State and local officials do not have the authority to interfere in the enforcement of federal law, even if the state or municipality has declared itself a ""sanctuary"". The criminal penalties for interference are spelled out here; no law compells cooperation, the law simply prohibits forcible interference.

"There has been quite a bit of misinformation flowing about COVID-19, some of it has even been reported on major news agencies, the one most heard about being Fox and Friends claiming, falsely, that the ability to hold your breath for 19 seconds is a good indicator of COVID-19 infection; but this is hardly limited to one show or wrong fact.  Given the threat of COVID-19, and how each infection increases the risk of future infections exponentially, the misinformation being spread could realistically put lives at risk.

Now I'm not suggesting anyone be punished for COVID-19 misinformation specifically, for many reasons.  However, it got me wondering at a more general level if there are forces in place to handle more direct and blatant spread of dangerous misinformation via the news.

It does make me wonder what laws exist for intentional spread of misinformation.  Slander and Libel laws only apply to misinformation about an individual, they wouldn't apply to other forms of misinformation.  The FDA has stepped in to stop false claims about drugs and medication, but again that is only one specific type of misinformation.

What about more general misinformation?  If some news agency decides as an April fools joke to report that the government is encouraging all kids to play on highways today, or some other grossly negligent and potentially dangerous fact, and there is reasonable evidence to suggest it was done intentionally what laws may be used to penalize such a dangerous spread of misinformation?
","While the other two sort out their disagreement, here's one way the broadcast of misinformation is regulated which is not subject to dispute.

There is a federal agency called the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  The FCC regulates interstate and international communications over TV, radio, satellite, cable, etc., throughout the US and its territories.  

Among its duties and powers, it prohibits the broadcast of false info regarding a crime or catastrophe if the broadcaster ""knows the information is false and will cause substantial 'public harm' if aired.""  FCC rules indicate that the harm ""must begin immediately and cause direct and actual damage to property or the health or safety of the general public; or divert law enforcement or public health and safety authorities from their duties."" 

Additionally, while law prohibits the FCC from engaging in censorship or otherwise infringing on First Amendment rights of the press, it is nonetheless illegal for ""broadcasters to intentionally distort the news, and the FCC may act on complaints if there is documented evidence of such behavior from persons with direct personal knowledge."" 

The FCC may not interfere with how a broadcaster chooses to select or present news or commentary and its authority to respond to complaints regarding the above is narrow in scope.  Generally, it cannot intervene without testimony from a person with ""direct personal knowledge of an intentional falsification of the news."" 

The FCC's authority for this may be found at 47 CFR § 73.1217, which states: 


  § 73.1217 Broadcast hoaxes. 
  No licensee or permittee of any broadcast
  station shall broadcast false information concerning a crime or a
  catastrophe if:
  
  (a) The licensee knows this information is false;
  
  (b) It is forseeable that broadcast of the information will cause
  substantial public harm, and
  
  (c) Broadcast of the information does in fact directly cause
  substantial public harm.
  
  Any programming accompanied by a disclaimer will be presumed not to
  pose foreseeable harm if the disclaimer clearly characterizes the
  program as a fiction and is presented in a way that is reasonable
  under the circumstances.


Important context is included in the accompanying note, which states: 


  For purposes of this rule, “public harm” must begin immediately, and
  cause direct and actual damage to property or to the health or safety
  of the general public, or diversion of law enforcement or other public
  health and safety authorities from their duties. The public harm will
  be deemed foreseeable if the licensee could expect with a significant
  degree of certainty that public harm would occur. A “crime” is any act
  or omission that makes the offender subject to criminal punishment by
  law. A “catastrophe” is a disaster or imminent disaster involving
  violent or sudden event affecting the public.


EDIT: Addition:

More helpful context may come from Sec. 4 of this law review article and you may find the article in general, about criminalizing false speech on social media, interesting: https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/assets/articlePDFs/v31/31HarvJLTech65.pdf

"I live in a fairly desirable area with one drawback: my apartment overlooks a multi-lane restricted access parkway. I'd prefer not to say more for privacy reasons. Until recently, it's been only a minor annoyance.

But since things have been locked down due to the coronavirus outbreak, I've been spending a lot more time at home, and the traffic on the parkway has gotten lighter, meaning that at least anecdotally speeds have increased. The result is a huge increase in infrasound. It's like my whole apartment is shaking all day.

I'm obviously not expecting the state to shut down traffic on the road completely for my comfort. It does seem like a reasonable expectation that the people driving on a roadway should get at least close to the legal speed limit, however. The posted speed on the road is 30 miles per hour, while drivers routinely flout this going 60 or 70 miles per hour.

I've already tried writing to my city government, who referred me to a state agency who hasn't written back. I've also contacted the person who represents me in my state legislature. His office too has not written back to me.

What's the most effective way to get my argument to a decision maker? Would I be better served addressing this complaint to the police department with jurisdiction over the roadway? Would I be better served organizing my neighbors and then returning to my state legislator with more of a coalition?

(I live in Boston, Massachusetts.)
","I see that this question has been migrated from Politics.SE, but I'd argue that's the better forum for this question. We're talking about finding a way to enforce the law, but the options available to you are pretty solidly in the political category.

What you're doing is probably the best way to go. The state government is unlikely to do much, so stay on top of your local government.

Communicate directly with the police, as many departments will make a point of setting up patrols in areas where they get complaints. 

On top of that, get as many people as you can to support your cause. The more noise they make, the harder it is for the government to ignore the problem. Circulate petitions, make calls, etc.

At the same time, keep in mind that this problem is a side effect of an emergency situation that is causing all sorts of problems that make yours look trivial by comparison. Do not be surprised if emergency personnel conclude that this is too low priority to address, even if it is remarkably inconvenient to you personally.

"Are there any privacy protections which would prevent a landlord from including the name of a specific tenant in a warning regarding Covid-19?

For context: Recently my partner and I (we live in Massachusetts) started exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19. After speaking with a doctor, we informed our landlord that we may be ill. He responded by saying that he has to inform other residents of our building that we are ill. While we agree that it is important for other residents to be aware and take extra precautions, we are concerned about our landlord including our names (particularly given that my partner is Asian-American).
","He can tell the world

You chose to tell him. He has no duty of confidence with you (he is not your health professional) so he can tell whoever he likes however he likes.

"The background is the outbreak of the coronavirus in China. Many infected people have been isolated to prevent the spread of the virus. However, medical resources are highly deficient in serious regions, leaving many patients untreated (or badly treated). Under this circumstance, is it just to isolate them?
","Questions about whether a certain action is ""just"" tend to be maters of opinion, politics and philosophy, but it can be addressed from the perspective of legal theory (especially following the model of common law, where legal principles are based on concepts of just and proper action). Whether or not a certain action is actually legal in a certain jurisdiction depends on the laws of that country -- I suspect that the answer is different for the US versus China.

The first question would be whether those government officials have the legal authority – I assume they do. Such authority is generally governed by some specific circumstances, for example, ""poses an imminent and grave threat to public health"". It is basically not a legal question whether quarantining in the face of this viral threat is necessary from a public health perspective, that is a medical question. What the law would say is that if this is a serious threat, then a person's liberty can be curtailed to a limited extent, because a person does not have the right to harm others because they don't want to do some thing that protects the rights of others (be vaccinated, stay in quarantine until it is safe). However, principles of legal justice also say that the government's response should be proportionate, e.g. shoot-on-sight in response to a sneeze is not proportionate. 

Quarantining has long been recognized as a valid, just and legal response to such extreme medical threats. Historically speaking, quarantining used to be the only effective action that a government can take against e.g. smallpox, plague, Spanish flu, Ebola.

"Recently several US cities banned large gatherings of events such as listed here.  Given that the 1st amendment of the US constitution states 


  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
  prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
  speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
  assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.


How is banning such events constitutional with the freedom of assembly?  If it were a political protest/gathering would this change?
","
  How is banning such events constitutional with the freedom of
  assembly?


The rights created by the First Amendment are not absolute. They are subject to reasonable restrictions as to time, place and manner, especially if those restrictions are content neutral. 

Restrictions narrowly tailored to protect against genuine threats public health and safety fall within the exception of the First Amendment even if they are not strictly content neutral, that is commonly described by the rubric that you don't have a right to falsely cry ""fire"" in a crowded theater (causing a riot that could harm people). 

For example, suppose that a rope bridge over a deep gorge can only support the weight of ten people, and three dozen people want to hold a protest there. A regulation that prohibited more than ten people from engaging in the protest would be constitutional.

Even then, however, a lack of content neutrality (e.g., restricting punishment to false statements likely to incite a riot) can't also be a lack of ideological neutrality (e.g. restricting punishment to anti-Catholic but not anti-Jewish statements likely to incite a riot).


  If it were a political protest/gathering would this change?


Generally speaking political protest/gatherings are still subject to content neutral regulations of time, place or manner, and those narrowly tailored to protect genuine threats public health and safety.

So, for example, if there is a genuine COVID-19 risk that public health officials are trying to address, and the regulation of gatherings is not viewpoint or content based, it would be upheld as constitutional in the face of a First Amendment freedom of assembly limitation.

But, if the regulation applied, for example, only to Republican and not Democratic party protests or gatherings, which is a viewpoint or content based restriction, it would not survive a First Amendment freedom of assembly challenge.

"I may have a number of reasons for wanting to intentionally expose myself to the coronavirus.  (Examples: I feel more capable of surviving it while I am younger.  It reduces my ability to carry and spread the virus once my immune system has developed antibodies.  It may strengthen the immune system against related viruses.)

Can a government legally prevent me from intentionally infecting myself with a virus?
","Governments have a significant interest in controlling pathogens and  preventing outbreaks: they are dangerous to dense &amp; unimmunized  populations.  


  Can a government legally prevent me from intentionally infecting
  myself with a virus?


Yes, governments have the broad authority to enact laws.  The US prohibits  and regulates pathogen experimentation (self-infection). There are also rules regarding shipping and export (ITAR).  Furthermore, in the US, there are (FL, NY state) laws that prevent patients from being tested unless the order is given by an authorized health care professional.  Hopefully, you do live in a state that does not have this regulation (AZ).

While I do believe in one's right to do as one sees fit with one's own body, there is the counter-argument: there must be limits when it comes to unnecessarily exposing the community to pathogen risk.  I hope that this question is theoretical and that nobody actually believes the immunity supposition without a credible peer-reviewed scientific publication.  Unfortunately we live in an age where misinformation is propagated at novel speed and scale.

I wish the OP well.  That being said, I have concerns regarding the underlying assumptions of the question.  While I am comfortable with the OP question, the underlying assumptions give me great pause.

UPDATE

IMHO: I hope that no reader will seriously consider amateur experimentation in self-infection in the hope of conferring immunity. Giving a pathogen uncontrolled safe-haven to propagate and possibly infect others seems irresponsible.

I doubt that the government cares if any individual manages to puts themselves in an early grave, however, it does care if amateurs create an unnecessary pandemic risk.   I would think that any government would view pathogen experimentation much like nuclear device experimentation, because of the mass casualty risk.  I hope that readers understand the implications of an amateur uncontrolled experiment.

"The next US census is scheduled for 2020-04-01. In light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic it might become necessary to delay this. How can this legally be done (since the census is required by the constitution)?
","The date of the census is not specified in the US constitution.  It only says


  The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.


There is no requirement that ""ten years"" be interpreted precisely to the day.  The date is fixed by statute at 13 USC 141(a):


  The Secretary shall, in the year 1980 and every 10 years thereafter, take a decennial census of population as of the first day of April of such year....


This requires that the census seek data describing the population on April 1, 2020.  It does not require that census workers actually visit people on that day.  They could conceivably do it in mid August, for example, or at any other time.  Of course, that would probably reduce the reliability of the census.  Congress could pass a law moving the census date to another later date if they wanted to get a more accurate count of the population on that date instead of a less accurate count of the population on the first of April.



In fact, when I got home later in the day after writing this answer, there was a letter from the census bureau inviting me to submit my census survey through the internet.  I did that a few minutes ago, so if I die in the next two weeks, the census will be off by one.

The letter I got says that if I don't fill out the survey online, they'll send me a paper questionnaire.  If I don't fill that out, someone will come to visit.  The prospect of that happening on April 1st seems quite remote.

"Recently I put down a holding deposit for an apartment I intend to move into next month (April 1). However, with the spread of COVID-19, moving in 2 weeks' time could be risky, or potentially impossible if I am quarantined. And, I don't know how many months I could be quarantined for.

Regarding the holding deposit, I was told: 


it's nonrefundable if we are approved (we were)
this deposit would be treated as part of our security deposit


Unfortunately I did not think to get a receipt or any of this in writing. I was clear that my move-in date would be April 1, and may have included this in my application. If they refuse to push forward my move-in date due to COVID-19, do I have grounds to receive my deposit back?

I haven't signed a lease yet. So perhaps when I receive the lease for review, it would be a good time to talk about flexibility for the move-in date.

I live in California.
","No.

Force majeure does not change contract terms (e.g. making a non-refundable deposit refundable). Rather, it allows parties to get away with not performing their obligations where circumstances beyond their control prevent them from doing so.

In your situation, all parties have performed their obligations so far. You paid the required deposit, they welcome you on the 1st of April.

It would therefore be much more likely that they get away with not refunding you a refundable deposit (if there was one) because of COVID-19 — than you get back the non-refundable one.

"We are witnessing the financial and personal repercussions of the spread of the corona virus that originated in Wuhan. It seems that the virus started spreading possibly as early as mid-November with the Chinese government trying to hide/downplay/minimize the issue at hand. Given the Chinese government failure to:


Prevent the sale of raw animal meat and enforce the necessary sanitary measures to avoid human contact with raw meat.
Allowing farming and selling of wild animals, which was than corrected later by issuing a law banning such sales, thus admitting the problem.
Properly contain the spread in Wuhan by acknowledging the alarm calls of the local doctors and first signs that an unknown strain of corona virus was circulating.


Is it possible for governments and private companies, I imagine only the most powerful ones, to sue the Chinese government to seek financial compensation for the damages occurred worlwide?

I imagine that if a private company would accidentally leak a virus outside a lab, such company would be liable for all damages, why is a government not liable for any damage in this case? Can, theoretically, Chinese or citizens from other countries sue the Chinese government for the loss of loved ones?
","The main problem is that there is no court with authority to hear this case outside of China. It may be futile to sue in US courts, since China will not enforce US judgments. You can sue a Chinese company in Chinese court, under their Civil Procedure Law, but this pertains to contract breach. The question is whether there is any law under which the government of China can be sued for negligence – it is unlikely that that is possible (perhaps there is an expert in Chinese law here who can address that issue).

This lawsuit is filed in US courts. It is based on the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. Supposing that this lawsuit is successful in US courts, then the question is what enforcement actions are possible. Since the defendants are various governments and government agencies in China, execution of the judgment would have to be against those defendants – you can't seize the assets of every person with some connection to China. But given the nature of the Chinese government, it is possible that US courts could find that the assets of Chinese companies are effectively government assets.

The short answer is, in fact a lawsuit has been filed, and I expect more. I also don't expect them to succeed in the long run.

"Several counties in California have issued a shelter in place order due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For example, see a Santa Clara’s order here.

The order states that individuals have to shelter in place. However, it lists multiple exceptions. If a police officer or other authority empowered to enforce this law asks you why you are outside, do you have to tell why you are outside or does the officer have to have reasonable suspicion you are in violation of the shelter in place order in order to detain you? This seems to be in violation of the concept that exercising your rights does not give grounds for reasonable suspicion or probable cause. Does an officer need probably cause that you are in violation of the order to arrest you? Or is it assumed that if you do not tell the officer what you are doing outside then your behavior is in violation of the order?
","The principle of constitutional law is that in order to arrest you, the officer would need probable cause. Certain acts are in themselves violations of the order (being closer to another person that 6 feet, illegal sneezing). Walking in public does not per se constitute a violation. In order to briefly stop a person walking on the street (a ""Terry stop""), the officer needs a reasonable suspicion that the person is in violation of the law. That means there has to be a reason, and a gut feeling does not count. An officer would not (legally) be able to stop every person they see walking down the street / driving, and demand an explanation of where they are going. If a person is just aimlessly wandering down the strees with friends (even if they are sufficiently separated), that could suffice to justify a stop, given the limited legal excuses for being outside your home.

"In the UK, the Prime Minister has stated


  Restaurants, pubs and clubs must close


Although our wedding venue has a bar, serves food and has a dance floor in the marquee, they have not closed and therefore our insurance is not paying out as the wedding can technically still go ahead.

Is the Prime minister’s closure statement enough to claim on our wedding insurance?
","What do the contracts with your suppliers and the policy with your insurer say?

Changes in government regulation do not ipso facto relieve Parties of the obligations under a contract under common (English) law. Contracts are allowed to allocate the risk of force majeure (and indeed, to define it because it has no common law meaning) but if they don’t, then each party bears their own risk and if they fail to honour their obligations they are in breach of contract. 

Common law does have the doctrine of frustration, however, that is much narrower and must result in the inability of the contract to be completed at all.

And then there are consumer rights which may apply.

When the dust settles, we are likely to see a lot of litigation around force majeure.

Your venue appears to be complying with both the law and their obligations under the contract so you have no breach of contract claim against them and no trigger for the insurance policy. If you choose to cancel, then you broke the contract.

Importantly, the position is reversed in civil law jurisdictions - a party unable to fulfil their obligations under a contract is not in breach.
"
"Across the world, the current pandemic, and various government responses to it will impact on parties abilities to perform their obligations under a contract. 

What are the legal implications of this?
","Force Majeure

An event like the current Covid-19 event is what is known as a force majeure event; a Latin term meaning ""superior force"". It refers to an event that is beyond the control of the parties to a contract such as war, civil disturbance, acts of God and disease.

Common law jurisdictions

In common law jurisdictions (most of the English-speaking world), force majeure is not a legal doctrine but a creature of the particular contract. That is, the extent to which a contract does or doesn't deal with such events is the extent to which such events apply to that particular contract. For example, a construction contract may specify that a contractor is responsible for the care, protection and reinstatement of the works unless damage is caused by war. So, if the damage is caused by war the principal bears the risk but if it's caused by, say, flood, the contractor bears the risk.

If a contract is silent on the matter (in general or in the specific) then the parties obligations remain unchanged by the event and failure to comply is a breach of contract. For example, absent a provision in a contract, in the current pandemic:


if a supplier is contracted to supply a component that was made in a foreign country and that cannot now be sourced from there; they will be in breach of their contract if they do not supply it. If it can be sourced from a local manufacturer at twice the price of the foreign source then that is the contractor's loss.
if a company is contracted to provide engineering services and their staff cannot travel (either because they are sick or because of government restrictions) then they will be in breach of their contract and the principal can seek damages.
if a construction contractor is obliged to finish by a given date and the government closes all construction sites, they will be in breach if they do not complete by that date notwithstanding.


These may seem to be unjust outcomes but, at the end of the day, somebody in the contract has to carry the cost of force majeure events and the development of the common law has left it for the parties to decide who. That is, at the time of negotiating the contract, the law allows that if the parties wanted to consider the risks of say, a pandemic, and spell out whose risk that was, they were free to do so and if they didn't that's their own fault - in the absence of such allocation, the parties must do what the contract says they must do. Common law jurisdictions have traditionally not seen it as the role of government to interfere in the details of private contracts.

Common law has a much narrower doctrine of frustration but this requires that the principal purpose of the contract be impossible to perform, not merely harder or more expensive to perform. Even much harder or much more expensive.

Civil law

In civil law jurisdictions (continental Europe with their ex-colonies and most of Asia), force majeure is a legal doctrine. 

It is a defence to liability where the defendant:


had nothing to do with the event - this pandemic would fit,
is unpredictable - it is not certain that the pandemic was unpredictable. There have been pandemics before and many organisations around the world exist specifically to respond to them. Lest this seems needlessly pedantic, there have been cases decided that because a flood occurred 69 years ago, this flood was predictable; similarly, an avalanche 50 years ago rendered this one predictable. If predictable, then the defendant is obliged to have prepared for it.
The consequences must have been unpreventable.


So, even though it exists in civil law it is not a get out of jail free card.

International law

The UNIDROIT Principles encompass force majeure as follows:


  Non-performance by a party is excused if that party proves that the non-performance was due to an impediment beyond its control and that it could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it or its consequences.

"(This is not about the coronavirus pandemic, which I understand is a different issue, but about the six countries that had already been maintaining border controls since related to migration and terrorism since 2016.)

Could someone explain to me the legal basis of Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway's extension of ""temporary reintroduction of border control"" declarations past the original 2-year deadline in November 2017? I'm trying to understand what the legal justification was for that, and I just keep getting more and more confused the more I read. Was the Commission's recommendation of September 2017 on extending the time frames adopted at some point? Or did they find some other loophole? 

I have found some media references to them ""switching to France's strategy"" (which I don't understand well either) or switching from Article 29 provisions to Article 25 provisions. But when I read the Schengen Borders Code, I can't find anything in Article 25 that I can manage to interpret as allowing unlimited extensions.

I understand that there's an argument that what these five countries and France have been doing is indeed illegal, but I want to also understand what their own lawyers' argument would be for its legality.

Thanks in advance!
","Regarding Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, details can be found on the Commission website. According to the table of all notifications, they all periodically invoke the “security  situation  in  Europe  and  threats  resulting from the continuous significant secondary movements”. This is obviously in blatant contradiction with article 25 but in practice that doesn't matter. You cannot find anything in there foreseeing unlimited extensions because there isn't. It's as simple as that, no sophisticated legal wizardry is involved (regarding the fate of Juncker's 2017 proposal: that limit hasn't changed since the current framework was introduced in 2013 and is still present in the June 2019 consolidated version of the Borders Code).

By contrast, France's strategy is to ignore the law entirely (as opposed to merely ignoring some specific clause of article 25): introduce quasi-systematic checks on some borders, don't try to create half-hearted legal justifications, don't notify the Commission or invoke some generic “persistent terrorist threat” applying to all borders and count on the Commission to carefully avoid challenging France on this. Back in 2015, the country suffered a string of deadly terrorist attacks and ultimately activated a state of emergency so that it had already invoked the right to reintroduce border controls and did not need any additional notification when the refugee crisis worsened.

The table on the Commission's website gives some additional insight into how all this came to pass. Back in 2015, many countries invoked article 28 with rather specific justifications related to the increasing number of refugees entering the Schengen area. After this initial unilateral move, the Council issued three recommendations to give these countries some legal cover (November 2016, February 2017, and May 2017) while roughly following the letter of article 25 (no more than six-month extension at once, not more than two years of border controls in total). Meanwhile, the Commission initiated a “Back to Schengen” strategy to try to salvage open borders in the Schengen area and make sure they appeared to be in charge.

But in reality, the countries in question were clearly intent on imposing checks no matter what, even if it was not possible to find some other face-saving legal basis. So when the last six-month period expired, they stopped being so specific and just reverted to a generic notification while everybody else turned a blind eye.

Note that the Commission does have a tool to enforce these rules and force a member state to, at the very least, make an effort to offer a more detailed legal rationale for its actions: infringement proceedings. For a long time, rules pertaining to the “Area of freedom, security and justice” were subject to different rules but since 2014, it falls under the ordinary EU law regime. The Commission has however been very shy in launching infringement proceedings on such a politically sensitive topic.
"
"I have been an employee at the company for over 5-year and I had requested time off work (4-months) to do sabbatical with some travelling. It was granted by my line manager. The request was made in person and then finalised in email.

However, fast-forward to now and due to the coronavirus pandemic, I have had to return home early from my travels, at great financial cost. As such, I am keen to start working again as soon as possible and can do so from home with ease. FYI, before leaving I was working from home once a week anyway!

I having had a call with my line manager, he says it won't be possible to return before the original return date, almost 2-months away. I am certain that in any normal situation (e.g. sans corona) they would be pleased to have me back early. After all, there was a reluctance to let me go in the first place. When I pressed him on why, I was told my pay wasn't in the budget for April and due to corona they were already down in their P&amp;L.

However, the UK government is willing to reimburse companies pay 80% of people's wages if the coronavirus has stopped them from working, so this seems a weak reason.

Either way, this leaves me in a very strange situation: I am employee but I am not being payed.

Therefore my questions are as such:


Can my company legally stop me from returning to work, if it is not from something such as illness, etc? Alternatively, there is a mechanism in place that can allow me to return to work earlier?
If I am not allowed to return to work, what does this mean for my employment status? If I was unemployed I could claim certain benefits, however, I would consider myself employed so I feel rather in limbo right now!


Any advice on this would be REALLY appreciated.

TL;DR


I requested 4-months leave
I have asked to start again 2-months
early
I am being denied that
Do I have a right to start again early?/Are they obligated to allow me to return early?




Outcome

It seems that I am in a rather strange, but probably not entirely unique position, so I will detail some findings for those that might find them useful.

My employment status remains ""Employed"", as suggested in the answers. However, I wrongly assumed this excludes me from claiming Universal Credits. As I am not current earning I can still apply (in fact you can apply if you are earning, that just take this into accounts and give you less). Hopefully this is useful to someone else in my position.
","No, they are not obliged to take you back early

As you say in your TL;DR you arranged 4 months leave and your employer no doubt made arrangements to deal with your absence. Now, you want to return early; they are not obliged to allow you to do so just as you would not be obliged to do so if they wanted you to cut your leave short.

No doubt the current pandemic has changed the situation and in its absence, they might have been more willing to have you back early. But then, you wouldn't want to be coming back early.

Your employment status is that you are employed and on leave. Subject to the details of your employment contract; there is nothing stopping you taking another job - there is a huge demand for logistics workers particularly in the health sector at the moment; much of it unskilled work. dIf you want to be unemployed, you can always resign.

"In UK employment law what are the differences between being furloughed, laid off, and made redundant?
","Redundancy is a form of dismissal from employment — in other words, a permanent end to your employment. This is usually done if an employer needs to downsize, or if the job that you are employed for no longer exists. For example, if A runs a factory and decides to close it, the employees of that factory would likely be redundant. You are generally entitled to redundancy pay in this case.

In the UK, a lay off is asking an employee to stay at home or take unpaid leave when the employer does not have any work to give the employee. This is a temporary situation: your employment does not end, but you may not be paid as there is no work for you to do. A person who is laid off may be entitled to statutory guarantee pay.

A furlough is essentially the same thing as a lay off, although the term has become significantly more popular during the COVID-19 pandemic. Government guidance states that


  If you and your employer both agree, your employer might be able to keep you on the payroll if they’re unable to operate or have no work for you to do because of coronavirus (COVID-19). This is known as being ‘on furlough’.


The government furlough scheme, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, has brought the term to greater attention, and this offers 80% of an employee's wages while they are under furlough.

"Due to COVID-19, I have decided not to return to my university in April (which was my original plan.) However, my university-approved apartment complex will not release me from my contractual obligation; they have only offered a discounted rent for the inconvenience.

  Can a shopowner in Thailand ban someone from entering their shop on the grounds of their citizenship?


The first tweet, explains the context properly: 


  I’m at my local hospital this afternoon to get a medical certificate. My work permit expires soon and so I need to run around getting all the documents in order. At the hospital they wanted to check my passport before letting me in to see if I had been abroad recently. 


Thailand has been very popular with visitors for decades and if laws existed that discriminated against foreigners this would be commonly known. 

So in this case the 'discrimination' probably not because of citizenship, but more about a faulty assumption that the virus is spread by foreigners. This will have nothing to do with Thai law.

The (tweet) OP quotes only another persons claim. The OP states in the first tweet that they checked his passport only to see if he was abroad recently. So he didn't share the same experience of the American. Based on that, this second hand source (that can't be verified) is probably unreliable. 

Due to the present (global) uncertainties, caused by the Coronavirus, one should look at the whole picture. 


  2020-02-04: Coronavirus: Chinese targeted as Italians panic - BBC News
  In Italy and elsewhere, panic is spreading much faster than the coronavirus itself. Chinese businesses are empty, shopkeepers are shutting down and Chinese nationals are being targeted.
  
  
  At a bar beside the Trevi fountain, a notice was put up banning customers from China.
  


So the the situation described by the original (tweet)  OP is understandable, but the quoted (but not varified) second hand source as well as the events in Italy are not. 


  The incidents have prompted condemnation from the Italian authorities.
  Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte reprimanded the regional governors, telling them that they were not competent to make such a call and that nothing justified such fear.




Discrimination, solely due to citizenship, would be against Human Rights prevention of discrimination. 

Special cases may exist for prices that are subsidized and thus only for residents. 

Dual pricing was common in the Czech Republic until 1999, when it was ruled illegal (but still persisted). Then a foreign resident had to supply proof of residency to avoid paying the higher price. 2007: Illegal practice of dual pricing persists in Czech Republic 

At the time we assumed that this was legal (it was certainly understandable), but it seems that was not the case.

"I live in the UK, and work on weekends for probably the UK's biggest fashion retailer. I recently got an email from them asking me to consent to the terms of a new contract. In it, I noticed this section, which does not apply to me but I found interesting anyway:


  
  If you commenced employment with [our company] after (and were not, therefore, on our payroll on) 28 February 2020, please read this
  section: 
  
  
  As you started employment with [our company] after 28 February 2020, we
  cannot include you in the UK Government’s Job Retention Scheme.
  However, I am pleased to confirm that we will furlough you under the
  same terms. 
  
  You will move into a period of furlough backdated to 24 March 2020 and
  until 31 May 2020 unless notice is given in writing by [our company] as set
  out below.


I'm confused as to the distinction between the Job Retention Scheme and furloughing. Does this mean that the government will not be paying for these workers, so the company will be paying for them instead, or does it mean something else that I'm missing here?
","Your interpretation seems to be correct. A furloughed employee is defined by Acas to be one who is ""temporarily sent home because there's no work"". This could in principle be through unpaid leave. 

The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is a government scheme to compensate employers for the wage bills of their staff during the furlough, so that the furloughed staff can continue to receive some income. An employee would have no direct dealings with the scheme and would continue to be paid via their employer. 

Your company seems to be offering to match the terms offered to employees under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme of 80% of salary, presumably out of their own funds. A kind gesture, it seems!

"I have a scaffolding license with my neighbours which permits me to scaffold in their garden for an agreed period for an agreed price. The issue is that my construction work has stopped due to the UK lockdown and I would like my license to be paused. I don't have a force majeure clause in the contract and I don't want to keep paying the neighbours whilst no work is going on. What should I do?
","Negotiate with your neighbour

Force Majeure in English law only exists if it is detailed in the contract. There is no general legal concept like there is in civil law jurisdictions. Further, even if there was such a clause, it would need to capture Covid-19 within the definition of Force Majeure either by defining it sufficiently broadly or by naming “pandemics” a one type of Force Majeure event.

English law has the much narrower doctrine of frustration but that requires that the supervening event becomes impossible, not just more onerous or expensive. It doesn’t apply here.

It’s also possible for a contract to have a change of law clause - this would probably apply to Covid-19 since the proximate reason for your work stopping is likely a government regulation. However, these are generally worded to allow the payee to recover additional costs of complying with the law, not to reduce the payer’s obligations. Notwithstanding, I’m guessing that your contract doesn’t have one of these either.

In your case you are required to keep paying and the have the scaffold removed before the deadline or you will be in breach and liable for damages. Under the terms of your contract, you took the risk of pandemics even if you didn’t know you were.

"our uni is closed because of the COVID-19 and I'm trying to homelearn dynamic programming. 

In our algorithms book, there is the following problem: (an example problem for dynamic programming)


  A driver has 3 cars. He wants to use all of the 3 cars, but want to
  use the least gas. Each car has a different engine, so it will consume
  different amounts of gas to get to each destination. What is the least amount of gas
  we can consume while still using each car? After he switches cars, he
  can't go back to the previous car. 
  
  Input description:
  
  First is a number $n$, which is the number of destinations that he
  wants to reach.  Then there are 3 lines, each is the gas consumed
  while trying to reach each destination (line 1 is car 1, line 2 is car
  2, etc..)
  
  Example input:
  
  7
  
  2 4 1 5 1 1 2
  
  3 3 2 5 3 2 2
  
  1 1 5 4 3 3 3
  
  Example output:
  
  12 (third car (2 destinations), first car (4 destinations), second car (1 destination).)


However, I can't figure out how to start, as I'm still learning DP. Could you please help me or give me any hints?

I think it's a great good example problem, because other problems are very similar so if I master this one, I should be able to solve other problems.

Thanks!
","Let $g(i,j)$ be the gas consumed when travelling to destination $i$ with car $j$.

Guess the optimal order $\langle c_1, c_2, c_3 \rangle$ of cars (there are only $3! = 6$ possible permutations). 

Define $OPT[i,j]$ as the minimum amount of gas needed for reaching the first $i$ destinations using cars $c_1, \dots, c_j$ in this order, with the constraint that each car must be used at least once. If no feasible solution exists then $OPT[i,j] = + \infty$.

According to the above definition, you have $$OPT[1,j] = \begin{cases}
g(1, c_1) &amp; \mbox{if } j=1 \\
+\infty &amp; \mbox{if } j&gt;1
\end{cases}$$.

and, for $i=2, \dots, n$: 

$$OPT[i,j] = g(i,c_j)+
\begin{cases}
OPT[i-1, j] &amp; \mbox{if } j=1 \\
\min\{ OPT[i-1, j], OPT[i-1, j-1] \} &amp; \mbox{if } j&gt;1
\end{cases}.$$

The solution to your problem is $OPT[n,3]$, which can be computed in $O(n)$ time using dynamic programming.

"Our college is switching to teaching online mid-semester in hopes of slowing the spread of Covid-19. All the molecular model kits are still on campus. How could you build a model of tetrahedral coordination (say methane) from materials found at home?

I'm aware of computer visualizations (and will make those available), but I think having a physical model when first encountering three-dimensional structures adds value. I made a model from lawn toys (see below), but these are not common household items.


","Inflate balloons, and tie them «at their stem» like a bouquet of flowers.  If you take four of them, not too much inflated, you well demonstrate a situation close to $sp^3$ hybridization. These models equally work well in larger lecture halls by the way, and intentionally using different colors allows many options.

"NOTE: Please do not delete this question.  It is not a personal health question.  The question has broad utility, in cases where others find themselves in social-distancing or quarantine with need for surface sanitizer, and their only available ingredients are water and powdered oxy-bleach.

I need a quantity of surface sanitizer to decontaminate boxes delivered to the house during the Coronavirus19 social-distancing period.  

CDC and WHO say 0.5% hydrogen peroxide solution will destroy coronavirus19.  And powdered oxy-bleach a.k.a. Sodium percarbonate contains 32.5% by weight of hydrogen peroxide, I'll call it roughly a third.

So to make a water solution of hydrogen peroxide using powdered oxy-bleach, I'm thinking I need to add enough powdered oxy-bleach (by weight) to equal 3 x 0.5% of the weight of the water. I.e, for a gallon of solution, 1.5% of 8.3 pounds, thus 0.12 lb, or ~2 oz.

A friend checked this and agreed, saying:
""A 0.5% H2O2 solution in water will consist of (per gallon): 0.42 lbs of H2O2 and 7.9 lbs of H2O. To get 0.42 lbs of H2O2 out of Oxy-bleach (32.5% H2O2), divide 0.42 by 0.325, which = 0.128 lbs or 2.0529230769 ounces...😁""

Can anyone poke holes in our thinking?  Or refine it?  Or suggest ways to make it easier for the lay-person locked-in without access to other surface sanitizers?

Thank you in advance!
","Yes, do use household dilute H2O2 but, in general, do not use commercial percarbonates powders as they can contain an additive to convert the friendly percarbonate into more powerful Peracetic acid (PAA). The latter allows the otherwise weak bleaching power of the H2O2 to compete with chlorine-based bleaching. However, this comes at a price (safety). Hence, the dire warning labels, usually in at least two languages, on Oxi-Bleach and generic related products.

I quote myself on this subject:


  Sodium percarbonate is chemically just an addition compound of Na2CO3 and Hydrogen peroxide.
  
  Also, while Sodium carbonate and Sodium percarbonate (basically Na2CO3 and 3Na2CO3.2H2O2) are often listed as the main ingredients in typical chlorine free bleach, an additive, TAED, which acts as a key activator (see, for example) is not even listed on the label. TetraAcetylEthyleneDiamine is apparently commonly employed as a bleach activator in many laundry products (see this).  TAED reacts with H2O2 in alkaline conditions (referred to as perhydrolysis) creating, in part, Peracetic Acid. The latter PAA is actually preferred over sluggish H2O2 for bleaching. In other words, it is not the H2O2 as the active bleaching agent, but PAA created in situ.  So, other than possibly misleading implying that eco friendly hydrogen peroxide is the active agent, it is, in reality, PAA, a probematic compound with associated  health concerns (see Marquand, E. C.; et al. , 2007. ""Asthma Caused by Peracetic Acid-Hydrogen Peroxide Mixture"". J. Occup. Health. 49 (2): 155–158.). Here is a MSDS on an actual PAA mix ( 76-61% water, PAA 20-35%, 3% Acetic acid and 1% H2O2) available at which is far from friendly but does eventually totally decompose into harmless O2, CO2, H2O,...
  
  As such anyone using a commercial percarbonate product should at least be aware of safety issues and that one is likely employing a Peracetic acid mix.


However, such more powerful PAA based mixtures do have their use and is recommended by the U.S. Military as a chemical/biological warfare decontamination protocol (see ""Development of Bicarbonate-Activated Peroxide as a Chemical and Biological Warfare Agent Decontaminant""). So, it is up to the user to weigh the relative risks of the situation.

"I'm trying to create Copper (II) Acetate crystals, but in these times of Coronavirus it's difficult to come by hydrogen peroxide. I could be patient, but I'm not, so I'm trying to make it electrochemically. I have 5% vinegar and lots of copper scrap, and an adjustable power supply. Unfortunately I can't barely get any current going, so I've thought of adding salt, regular NaCl. I'm curious what effect this will have on the final outcome though. Balancing equations is something I struggle with, but I'd really like to learn the chemistry here. Will the salt interfere with or alter the growth of the copper acetate crystals? Ultimately I'm trying to make calcium copper acetate crystals, I've already made the calcium acetate.
","To prepare copper acetate absence H2O2, employ a known method from hydrometallurgy to process copper ore employing aqueous ammonia, air (a source of oxygen) and a small amount of salt (acting as an electrolyte for this, in part, spontaneous electrochemical reaction detailed below). This results in tetra-ammine copper hydroxide. The latter exists only in solution and upon evaporation yields CuO (and possibly some Cu2O also, see this old patent). Add an acid of choice (like vinegar, a source of acetate) to convert CuO into copper acetate. 

Related copper chemistry with ammonia and oxygen:

Cited half-reactions:

$\ce{1/2 O2 + H2O + 2 e- -&gt; 2 OH-}$ (cathodic reduction of O2 at surface of the Copper)

And, at the Copper anode, the formation of the complex:

$\ce{Cu + 4 NH3 + 2 H2O -&gt; [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2](2+) + 2 e-}$ (anodic dissolution of Cu by a complexing agent)

With an overall reaction:

$\ce{Cu + 4 NH3 + 1/2 O2 + 3 H2O -&gt; [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2](2+) + 2 OH-}$

Also, some interesting cited standard chemical reactions, where copper oscillates between cuprous and cupric states as noted by the source below:

$\ce{2 Cu + 4 NH3 + 1/2 O2 + H2O -&gt; 2 [Cu(NH3)2]OH}$

$\ce{2[Cu(NH3)2]OH + 4 NH3 (aq) + 1/2 O2 + H2O -&gt; 2 [Cu(NH3)4](OH)2}$

$\ce{Cu + [Cu(NH3)4](OH)2 &lt;--&gt; 2 [Cu(NH3)2]OH}$

Reference: ""Kinetics and Mechanism of Copper Dissolution In Aqueous Ammonia"" and a related work detailing reactions: ‘Copper Dissolution in Ammonia Solutions: Identification of the Mechanism at Low Overpotentials’, which is also a fully available PDF.

Some alternate preparations would be to follow paths to copper patina (see this site, which discusses three paths for the home chemists which includes an embodiment of the ammonia prep, and, with the addition of vinegar, would convert the basic copper carbonate to copper acetate.

"I have a question related to SARS-CoV-2 virus spreaded in the air. 

This Straits Time article from March 18 describes a new study: 


  The tests show that when the virus is carried by the droplets released when someone coughs or sneezes, it remains viable, or able to still infect people, in aerosols for at least three hours.


Examples of aerosol are fog, dust, particulate air pollutants (e.g. pollen), smoke, etc.

That being said, is essentially saying that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is all over in the air, right?

I am saying that SARS-CoV-2 virus can be everywhere in the world. Why? Because, for example, dust is everywhere in the air and air is not static, i.e. ""it flies"" from one site to another and hence it can move to a place where no infected people have been at.

Am I understanding this correctly?

Thank you in advance
","You are not understanding it correctly

There is a significant difference between an aerosol, dust and droplets. Furthermore the intermixing of air is not as you claim it is, it is in fact, quite static. If air just went everywhere immediately there would not be clouds, temperature differences, or indeed any weather effects at all.

A question you could ask yourself is: With my current understanding, covid-19 should be everywhere. There should not exist differences between cities and rural areas, or between countries. But there is.

Listen to the advice of health services and the government. They know their shit.

"I'm currently studying in the International Baccalaureate model. This high school model asks their students to do an individual work called the Internal Assessment. One of the subjects I study is chemistry, and my Chemistry Internal Assessment is based on the production of hydrogen (a source of energy) in the water electrolysis as a way to save electrical energy. I was going to do an experiment to measure the production of hydrogen in the electrolysis of water with various concentrations of four different solutes (NaCl, NaOH, sulphuric acid and sodium bicarbonate, but any electrolyte will do). However, with the Covid-19 outbreak, I cannot go to the laboratory, so in order to get the data I need, I searched on google databases with the information I wanted, but I found barely nothing. These links (https://www.scirp.org/pdf/NR_2013032814044640.pdf) (https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/se/c7se00334j) are the only useful pdfs I found, and I wonder if anyone could help me giving me some databases with the data I need.
","Alejandro, you are right, the electrolytes will make a difference. The difference is not in terms of hydrogen production per se, as Maurice mentions in the comments, it will be in terms of energy saving. Electrolytic reactions are ""exact"" in the sense that if 100 electrons reach the electrode from a battery, 100 hydrogen ions will be reduced. In other words,

1 mole of electrons will reduce exactly 1 mole of a monovalent ion, 1/2 mole of a divalent, 1/3 mole of a trivalent ion and so on.

You would probably like to have an electrolyte which has the least electrical resistance. Now you may recall that the proton in water (= hydrogen ion) has the least electrical resistance known today. What comes next? Hydroxide ions.

All you have to search and study is the conductivity of electrolytes at various concentrations.

"I did asked before , but apparently providing a link to a science report of harmless for humans (both skin and eyes) far-UV light was not enough to make people understand the significance of the solution to the raging COVID-19.
So this link (please read a bit of it):
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w
Says that the UV light of wavelength 222 nanometers (the photons bounces off the skin and the eyes) is absolutely harmless and do not make neither skin cancer or cataract. So this light is deadly for viruses and is not commercially available to anyone like ordinary humans (perhaps only some labs got it but sure cannot by on amazon or ebay or so). So if you wish to protect people you ideally need something to kill the virus in mid-air exactly as this lamp does.
Cite: ""By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207–222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin."" - this line is at the beginning of the link above.
So my idea is to help ordinary people that have some DIY experience to make a lamp and disinfect the clothes and themself like skin and face and face mask and so.
So a guy good in chemistry of similar that ca help with his knowledge and experience to help the people and get rid of the virus.
The research I did in the internet says that the UV has ability to kill virus in 10 seconds.
So having a lamp emitting harmless 222nm UV light instead the cancer deadly 254nm UV germicidal lamps will be able to protect from the diseases.
The question is how to make it.

so I suppose you can type a good way to do it and save the half of the western world population (the old people like your grandma and grandpa)?

(Nobody needs glass (or quartz) blowing of a lamp. Neither skills beyond the ordinary DIY - well it might be a need of experienced DIY-er.)
","UVC is very harmful to people and requires specialist equipment to create and use safely

You are not going to be able to create or use lamps that emit 222nM light without specialist equipment, and even if you could it would almost certainly not be safe.

Far UV lamps are widely commercially available for germicidal applications and these usually use mercury vapour fluorescent discharge tubes with no phosphors so have a strong emission around 250nM from a line in the mercury emission spectrum. They are very dangerous to people and have caused significant harm when used accidentally (see this video from BigClive describing what happens when they are used accidentally instead of the much less harmful ""black light"" tubes commonly used for discos and events). 

Another important fact to bear in mind is that UVC lamps of this type have to use specialist glass in manufacture because common types of glass strongly absorb UVC wavelengths. So, while they are readily available, they are not easy for an amateur to make.

You report a claim from a Nature paper than a tightly controlled UVC light of around 222nM wavelength is not harmful to people. I would be far more cautious as the Nature paper did not do extensive safety studies on the actual effect on people and given what we know about wavelengths not much longer, the claim would need some extensive validation.

But you have bigger problems than this in your pursuit of an easy-to-make solution accessible to amateurs. First, you cannot easily get around the problem of the glass used absorbing the wavelengths you want to see: you will need specialist material. Second, the actual excimer lamps as used in the nature paper are sophisticated devices that cannot easily be made by non-specialists (they are far more complex than the relatively conventional discharge tubes used in commercial UV lamps which are essentially the same as conventional visible fluorescent lamps apart from the need for specialist glass). Apart from anything else the lamps have a strong emission at around 258nM, exactly the wavelength known to be very dangerous to people from simple UVC mercury vapour lamps. The NAture paper reported using specialist narrow band filters to eliminate those wavelengths. These are unlikely to be easy to obtain. Third, creating the excimer lamps is a sophisticated process requiring specialist pulsed electronic drivers to get the lamp to work (most likely, according to this reference in the Nature paper, you need to fine tune the gas mixture and the pressure and the driving electronics for the lamp which is far more complex than a simple driver for a fluorescent tube).

And, as for ""Nobody needs glass (or quartz) blowing of a lamp"", I'm afraid you are delusional. You need specialist glass to let the right wavelengths through and specialist filters to kill the harmful wavelengths. This is not ""simple DIY"".

You have seen an interesting paper in Nature and assumed it is easy for someone to make in their shed. This is not true. Specialist skills are required and attempting anything without those skills is likely highly dangerous (and that is ignoring the issues of handling the chemicals and vacuum technology needed to create the lamp: both are dangerous). 

And, perhaps more importantly, the best way to avoid contamination of others with covid-19 is to wash your hands. There are no easy technological silver bullets here, though, perhaps, professional engineers and chemists can build something safe based on the Nature observation in the future.

"I’m designing an experiment which requires I measure final and initial lead concentrations for the determination of aqueous lead uptake by different mediums. Because lead concentrations would be measured on the ppm scale, I’d need to use a spectrophotometer to measure light absorbance by the water samplings. I could then use Beer Lambert’s Law to determine concentration. 

With recent protocols surrounding COVID-19, it’s been difficult to contact an institution. I was wondering if there was any way I could measure light absorbance of my samples at home. Is there some other apparatus I could look into using (or perhaps even purchase)? 

All the best!
","Another possibility is the grease spot photometer (aka Bunsen photometer) German Wiki page. This can be homemade, you need a piece of paper, some wax or oil, two light sources, a meter stick and for the measurement of solutions also some e.g. cardboard to shield unwanted light. Also the darker the room, the better.

The underlying idea is that light intensity from two different sources can be compared (and found to be equal) with a paper with a grease (waxed) spot: the spot will vanish when as much light is transmitted through the spot as reflected around. 

If you move a light source to achieve this condition, you can conclude relative intensities from the distance (intensity goes 1 / d² with d the distance from the respective light source). 

Here's a youtube video demonstrating this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgZdl4qRa48



How to measure photometrically

so schematically we have:

o--U----|----o

+---d---+


with light sources o, cuvette U and the spotted paper |. Measure distance $d$ between equal intensity paper position and the light source with the cuvette. 

We have $I_{transmitted} \sim \frac{1}{d^2}$

Next, a calibration series is acquired as usual: blank (which serves as $I_0$) and concentrations over the calibration range. Almost as usual:

$$E = -\lg \frac{I}{I_0} \sim \varepsilon l c$$
$$-\lg \frac{d_0^2}{d^2} = b c$$ 
$$\lg d = a + b' c$$ 

$a$ and $b$ are determined by calibration - I use here $a$ instead of $2 \lg d_0$ because several choices are possible and in general the fitted value should be used rather than the theoretical one since it includes some effects in which practice differs from theory (e.g. differences between % transmission in the grease spot from % reflection outside).

Standard addition instead of calibration would be possible as well.
"
"So the coronavirus has a lipid bilayer where the hydrophilic heads are facing outward. So why can't water just stick to these ends and flush out the virus particles from our hands? Is it because our hands stick better to the virus? If so, why and how does the virus stick better to our hands than water?
","Because your hands are covered in a thick crust of dirt, dust and fats, in which the virus can hide. 

But anyway still nobody has been able to show that this virus is regularily (or even rarely) transmitted via smear infection. (If someone knows about any evidence to the contrary, please come forward. And yes, some other diseases, especially bacterial infections, do even mainly take this route. That´s how you usually get the ""shits"".)

It can be detected on surfaces after hours via PCR, however PCR is as sensitive to broken down pieces of a virus particle as it is to the fresh, contagious specimen. Obviously the RNA pieces also of a destroyed virus would not evaporate, so the result of these investigations proves nothing but the extremely obvious. Newspapers are spreading it as a piece of clickbait and tinder, causing people to buy lots of ""sanitizers"".

Anyway, use soap, leave the disinfectants to the health care people who absolutely, direly need them, and be done.

I also tried fitting with GAs (as in the paper), also to no avail.

My question
Am I making any mistakes or is there just not enough data yet? Or is the SIR model too simple? I would appreciate suggestions on how to change the code so that I get some sensible numbers out of it.

Addendum
I wrote a blog post based on the final model and current data: Epidemiology: How contagious is Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?
","There are several points that you can improve in the code 

Wrong boundary conditions

Your model is fixed to I=1 for time zero. You can either changes this point to the observed value or add a parameter in the model that shifts the time accordingly.

init &lt;- c(S = N-1, I = 1, R = 0)

# should be

init &lt;- c(S = N-Infected[1], I = Infected[1], R = 0)


Unequal parameter scales

As other people have noted the equation  

$$I' = \beta \cdot S \cdot I - \gamma \cdot I$$

has a very large value for $S \cdot I$ this makes that the value of the parameter $\beta$ very small and the algorithm which checks whether the step sizes in the iterations reach some point will not vary the steps in $\beta$ and $\gamma$ equally (the changes in $\beta$ will have a much larger effect than changes in $\gamma$). 

You can change scale in the call to the optim function to correct for these differences in size (and checking the hessian allows you to see whether it works a bit). This is done by using a control parameter. In addition you might want to solve the function in segregated steps making the optimization of the two parameters independent from each others (see more here: How to deal with unstable estimates during curve fitting? this is also done in the code below, and the result is much better convergence; although still you reach the limits of your lower and upper bounds)

Opt &lt;- optim(c(2*coefficients(mod)[2]/N, coefficients(mod)[2]), RSS.SIR, method = ""L-BFGS-B"", lower = lower, upper = upper,
         hessian = TRUE, control = list(parscale = c(1/N,1),factr = 1))


more intuitive might be to scale the parameter in the function (note the term beta/N in place of beta)

SIR &lt;- function(time, state, parameters) {
  par &lt;- as.list(c(state, parameters))
  with(par, { dS &lt;- -beta/N * S * I
  dI &lt;- beta/N * S * I - gamma * I
  dR &lt;- gamma * I
  list(c(dS, dI, dR))
  })
}


Starting condition

Because the value of $S$ is in the beginning more or less constant (namely $S \approx N$) the expression for the infected in the beginning can be solved as a single equation:

$$I' \approx (\beta \cdot N - \gamma) \cdot I $$

So you can find a starting condition using an initial exponential fit:

# get a good starting condition
mod &lt;- nls(Infected ~ a*exp(b*day), 
           start = list(a = Infected[1],
                        b = log(Infected[2]/Infected[1])))


Unstable, correlation between $\beta$ and $\gamma$

There is a bit of ambiguity how to choose $\beta$ and $\gamma$ for the starting condition. 

This will also make the outcome of your analysis not so stable. The error in the individual parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ will be very large because many pairs of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ will give a more or less similarly low RSS. 

The plot below is for the solution $\beta = 0.8310849; \gamma = 0.4137507 $



However the adjusted Opt_par value $\beta = 0.8310849-0.2; \gamma = 0.4137507-0.2$ works just as well:





Using a different parameterization

The optim function allows you to read out the hessian

&gt; Opt &lt;- optim(optimsstart, RSS.SIR, method = ""L-BFGS-B"", lower = lower, upper = upper,
+              hessian = TRUE)
&gt; Opt$hessian
            b            
b  7371274104 -7371294772
  -7371294772  7371315619


The hessian can be related to the variance of the parameters (In R, given an output from optim with a hessian matrix, how to calculate parameter confidence intervals using the hessian matrix?). But note that for this purpose you need the Hessian of the log likelihood which is not the same as the the RSS (it differs by a factor, see the code below).

Based on this you can see that the estimate of the sample variance of the parameters is very large (which means that your results/estimates are not very accurate). But also note that the error is a lot correlated. This means that you can change the parameters such that the outcome is not very correlated. Some example parameterization would be:

$$\begin{array}{}
 c &amp;=&amp; \beta - \gamma \\
 R_0 &amp;=&amp; \frac{\beta}{\gamma}
\end{array}$$

such that the old equations (note a scaling by 1/N is used):

become

R^\prime &amp;=&amp; c \frac{1}{R_0-1}&amp; I&amp;
\end{array}
$$

which is especially appealing since you get this approximate $I^\prime = cI$ for the beginning. This will make you see that you are basically estimating the first part which is approximately exponential growth. You will be able to very accurately determine the growth parameter, $c = \beta - \gamma$. However, $\beta$ and $\gamma$, or $R_0$, can not be easily determined.

In the code below a simulation is made with the same value $c=\beta - \gamma$ but with different values for $R_0 = \beta / \gamma$. You can see that the data is not capable to allow us differentiate which different scenario's (which different $R_0$) we are dealing with (and we would need more information, e.g. the locations of each infected individual and trying to see how the infection spread out).

It is interesting that several articles already pretend to have reasonable estimates of $R_0$. For instance this preprint Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: early estimation of epidemiological parameters and epidemic predictions (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549)

How is R0 estimated?

The graph above (which is repeated below) showed that there is not much variation in the number of 'infected' as a function of $R_0$, and the data of the number of infected people is not providing much information about $R_0$ (except whether or not it is above or below zero).

However, for the SIR model there is a large variation in the number of recovered or the ratio infected/recovered. This is shown in the image below where the model is plotted not only for the number of infected people but also for the number of recovered people. It is such information (as well additional data like detailed information where and when the people got infected and with whom they had contact) that allows the estimate of $R_0$.



Update

In your blog article you write that the fit is leading to a value of $R_0 \approx 2$. 

However that is not the correct solution. You find this value only because the optim is terminating early when it has found a good enough solution and the improvements for given stepsize of the vector $\beta, \gamma$ are getting small. 

When you use the nested optimization then you will find a more precise solution with a $R_0$ very close to 1. 

We see this value $R_0 \approx 1$ because that is how the (wrong) model is able to get this change in the growth rate into the curve.

This is a restriction of the SIR model which models $R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$ where $\frac{1}{\gamma}$ is the period how long somebody is sick (time from Infected to Recovered) but that may not need to be the time that somebody is infectious. In addition, the compartment models is limited since the age of patients (how long one has been sick) is not taken into account and each age should be considered as a separate compartment.

But in any case. If the numbers from wikipedia are meaningfull (they may be doubted) then only 2% of the active/infected recover daily, and thus the $\gamma$ parameter seems to be small (no matter what model you use).

"Is there a way to calculate the riskiest places to be infected by COVID-19? My friends and I are having an argument of whether being in a ""high traffic-short contact time"" situation (public transport) vs ""low traffic-high contact time"" situation (e.g. place of worship/seminar) is more risky to be infected. 

I know it's wise to avoid all of such situations in the practice. But I want to find a way to calculate it even if it requires assigning dummy/guesswork numbers for unknown probability. Where do I begin?
","First of all,

The computation is very theoretic and not a good representation or guideline for adapting your behavior (just in case, if that is what you are after). In the comments I had already mentioned several points of critique for this approach:


The problem is that these computations will be based on highly subjective estimates about the underlying model/assumptions. Yes, you can compute it.... But do not expect that the answer is rigorous just because it has used mathematics
Another problem is that the descriptions of contacts are very complex. How exactly are you gonna be in the description of the 'time of contact'? Are you differentiating just the time of contact or also the type of contact? It is not a deterministic model and you need to deal with with distributions and stochastic behaviour that will make computations more difficult.

See for example the report about transmission of SARS in airplanes: there were three cases described with an infected person on board. In one case tens of other passengers got infected. In the other two cases it was only one other person (a crew member) that got infected. 
In addition, are you gonna describe the probability for a single person, or the probability for the public health? In high traffic the probability for a single individual might be low but due to the large number of individuals in those situations there might be a probability that at least one or more persons get infected. 

For public health, the problem is not to compare cases based on the probabilities for individuals to become sick. But instead, the point is to reduce the probability for individuals spreading the virus, make others sick. In general those probabilities (to make others sick) are much higher with high traffic cases. Sick people should not be around many other people.

There are many of these strange probability effects around. For instance, in Europe there is a lot of focus on people who had contact with the high risk areas; and it seems to be ignored that one may acquire the virus locally as well.  
Indeed, when considering only a contact with a single person, then it is more likely to obtain the virus if this person is from (or had contact with) a high risk area. However, due to the much larger number of contacts with people outside the risk area it may be more likely to acquire the virus from one of those people, albeit the fact that the risk per contact is lower.  Still, it is not illogical to focus on the high risk areas. But that is more a consideration from the point of view of focusing the limited time, money and materials. Yes, it is more likely to get the coronavirus from somebody that is not from the risk area's. But there are many other viruses from which one may obtain a common cold and we can not deal with all of those cases. When we wish to focus efforts on the most important cases, then the consideration is for which people the common cold is most likely to be due to the coronavirus. In that case it is linked to the high risk areas. 




A possible solution (based on a simple model),

Let's consider the (unrealistic) probability of obtaining an infection, conditional on the other person being sick (this is a bit complex, there are different levels of being sick but let's consider this for single cases).

Say, the probability 'to get sick from a single contact of time $t$' is a function of contact time according to some (sort of) homogeneous Poisson process (ie. the waiting time to get hit/sick depends on an exponentially distributed variable and the longer the contact the more likely to get sick) 

$$P(\text{sick from contact time $t$}) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}$$

If you encounter $n$ people, each for a time $t$, sampled from a population of which $p\%$ are sick...


then the number of sick people, $S$, that you encounter is binomial distributed $$P(S=s) = {{n}\choose{s}} p^s(1-p)^{n-s}$$
the probability of getting sick from those $S$ people is: $$P(\text{sick} \vert t,s) = 1- e^{-\lambda ts}$$
the marginal probability of getting sick is $$\begin{array}{}
P(\text{sick} \vert t, n) &amp; = &amp; \sum_{s=0}^n
\overset{{\substack{\llap{\text{probability}}\rlap{\text{ to encounter}} \\ 
\llap{\text{$s$ sick }}\rlap{\text{people}}  }}}{\overbrace{P(S=s)}^{}}
 \times \underset{{\substack{\llap{\text{probability to  }}\rlap{\text{get sick}} \\ \llap{\text{conditional}} \rlap{\text{ on}} \\ \llap{\text{encountering $s$}} \rlap{\text{ sick people}}
}}}{\underbrace{P(\text{sick} \vert t,s)}_{}} \\ \\
&amp;=&amp; 1- \sum_{s= 0}^n {{s}\choose{n}} p^s(1-p)^{n-s}e^{-\lambda ts} \\ &amp;=&amp; 1- \left(1- p + pe^{-\lambda t}\right)^n 
\end{array}$$ where I solved this last term with wolframalpha.


Note that 

$$\lim_{n\to \infty} 1- \left(1- p + pe^{-\lambda t/n}\right)^n = 1 - e^{-\lambda t p} $$

For a given fixed total contact  $C = n\times t \times \lambda$ you get an increase as function of $n$. For instance, if $C = 10$ then:



Intuitive overview

Below are two graphs that show the value of this term $1- \left(1- p + pe^{-\lambda t}\right)^n $ as function of contact time $t$ and number of contacts $n$. The plots are made for different values of $p$.

Note the following regions:


On the right side the contact time is very large and you are almost certainly gonna get infected if the person that you have contact with is sick. More specifically for the lower right corner (if $n=1$ and $t$ is very large) the probability of getting sick will be equal to $p$ (ie. the probability that the other person is sick). 
More generally for the right side, the region where $\lambda t&gt;1$, a change in the contact time is not gonna change much the probability to get sick from a single person (this curve $1-e^{-\lambda t}$ doesn't change much in value for large $\lambda t$).

So if $\lambda t&gt;1$ (and you are almost certainly getting sick if the other person is sick) then if you halve the contact time and double the number of contacts, then this is gonna increase the probability to get sick (because the probability to encounter a sick person increases).
On the left side for $\lambda t &lt; 1$ you will get that at some point an increase of $n$ with an equal decrease of $t$ will counter each other. On the left side it doesn't matter whether you have high traffic short time vs. low traffic high time.








Conclusion

So, say you consider total contact time $n\times t$ being constant, then this should lead to a higher probability for getting sick for higher $n$ (shorter contacts but with more people). 

Limitations

However the assumptions will not hold in practice. The time of contact is an abstract concept and also the exponential distribution for the probability of getting sick from a single person is not accurate.


Possibly there might be something like contact being more/less intense in the beginning (to compare in the simple model the probability to get sick from a single contact of time $t$ is approximately linear in time $1-e^{\lambda t} \approx \lambda t$)
Also when considering infections of groups, instead of individuals, then there might be correlations like when a sick person sneezes then it will hit multiple people at the same time. Think about the cases of superspreaders, e.g. the case of the SARS outbreak in the Amoy Gardens apartment complex where likely a single person infected hundreds of others)


So based on the simple model there is this effect that of for a given total time of contact, $n \times t$, is better to spread it out among less people, $n$. 
However, there is an opposite effect. At some point, for short $t$, the transmission will be relatively unlikely. For instance, a walk on a busy street means high $n$ but the contacts will not be meaningful to create a high risk. (Potentially you could adapt this first equation $1 - e^{\lambda t}$ but it is very subjective/broad). You could think like something as the '5 seconds rule' (which is actually not correct but gets close to the idea).

Use of the simple model

Although the model used here is very simplistic, it does still help to get a general idea about what sort of measures should be taken and how the principle would work out for a more complex model (it will be more or less analogous to the simple model): 

On the right side (of the image), it doesn't help much to change (reduce) the contact time, and it is more important to focus on reducing the number of contacts (e.g. some of the rigorous advise for non-sick family-members that are in quarantine together with sick family members are not much useful since restricting $\lambda t$ for large $\lambda t$ has little effect and it would be better to focus on making less contacts; go cook yourself instead of ordering that pizza)

On the left side, reductions should be weighed against each other. When restrictions that reduce high traffic are gonna lead to low traffic but a longer time then the measures are not gonna help a lot. 

A very clear example: I am currently waiting in line to enter the supermarket. They have decided to reduce the number of total people inside the supermarket. But this is entirely useless and possibly detrimental. The total time that we are in contact with other people does not decrease because of this.

"I am trying to forecast aggregated daily COVID cases in Europe. These are present day numbers in Italy. 

temp &lt;- c(0    , 0    , 0  ,   0  ,   0   ,  0   ,  0  ,   0 ,    0,     2,

 3  ,   3  ,   3   ,  3  ,   3   ,  3,     3 ,    3   ,  3  ,   3,
20   , 62  , 155 ,  229 , 322  , 453   ,655  , 888,  1128 , 1694,2036 , 
2502 ,3089 , 3858,  4636 , 5883 , 7375,  9172, 10149, 12462,12462)


My problem is that all the models underestimates the exponential growth patterns as this one with exponential smoothing. (if I try to predict using data until 4636 value, the different models estimates 8-9,0000 when the real number was 12,462). I have tried transformations, different models etc.

I a little confounded by this, because the development until present day is actually pretty straight forward (exponential). I don't like fitting a exponential regression model as this will not catch up when the exponential part of the epidemic stops. (I think)
","You can force ets() to use a model with multiplicative trend (and multiplicative error) by using the parameter model=""MMN"". Of course, you need to start the series later, since multiplicative trends and errors don't make sense for zero values.

temp3 &lt;- ts(temp[-(1:9)], start = c(2020, 32), 
            frequency = 365.25)
test &lt;- ets(temp3,model=""MMN"")
test %&gt;% forecast(., h = 14) %&gt;% autoplot()




I certainly hope this graphic is what you wanted.

It also illustrates why ets() is very careful about fitting multiplicative trends on its own. They can and will explode. Also:


  I don't like fitting a exponential regression model as this will not catch up when the exponential part of the epidemic stops.


Of course, ets() will not know when to stop extrapolating the exponential growth, so this (extremely correct) rationale applies equally to ets(). You may want to consider models that are explicitly tailored towards epidemiology or (market) penetration, like the Bass diffusion model or similar.

EDIT: Rob Hyndman explains in more depth why smoothing and similar models do not make a lot of sense to forecast COVID-19, and gives pointers to more appropriate models. And here is Ivan Svetunkov.

"I am asking this question because I believe it would be great if the statistics community could make a contribution to solving this serious puzzle until more evidence is available. 

The UK Royal Office of Obstetricians and Gynecologists publishes guidelines on neonatal and prenatal treatment of Corona positive women and babies of Corona positive women. There is insufficient evidence to give an advice whether breastfeeding is safe in the sense of not passing virus from mother to child via the mother milk. There are other infection ways but mother milk could be expressed and fed while keeping distance, e.g. by father.

A source is quoted in the guidelines (p. 27) that 6 Chinese women's breast milk was tested Corona negative; that is, six of out six samples were negative. If we consider these tests independent events, where the event is to sample a woman who passes the virus via the mothermilk, we have a binomial trial.

Which confidence or credibility statements can we make about the probability to pass on the virus to the mother milk? This probability is estimated at zero in this trial, of course. 

Some statements can be made; for example if the probability was 0.50 the likelihood of the data would be 0.015. If it approaches 0, the likelihood approaches 1, but it is not differentiable at zero, so standard likelihood inference fails.

Please note: The same guidelines advise in section 4.8.2 to continue breastfeeding by COVID-19 positive women: ' In the light of the current evidence, we advise that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. The risks and benefits of breastfeeding, including the risk of holding the baby in close
proximity to the mother, should be discussed with her.' (p. 27)
","There is the rule of three saying 


  if a certain event did not occur in a sample with $n$ subjects, the interval from $0$ to $3/n$ is a 95% confidence interval for the rate of occurrences in the population.


You have $n=6$, so says $[0, 3/6=0.5]$ is a 95% confidence interval for the binomial $p$ of transmission. In non-technical language: 6 non-events is way too few for any strong conclusions. This data is interesting, suggesting something, but no more.

This rule of three is discussed at CV multiple times Is Rule of Three inappropriate in some cases?, When to use (and not use) the rule of three, Using Rule of Three to obtain confidence interval for a binomial population and certainly more ... A more principled approach is here:  Confidence interval around binomial estimate of 0 or 1   and using code from an answer to that question:

binom::binom.confint(0, 6, method=c(""wilson"", ""bayes"", ""agresti-coull""), type=""central"")

"Pretty much the title, I am looking for some more in-depth explanation of the models used in the papers from Imperial College and The Lancet. In the second one, they are using something called a branching process model, but they are sampling from strange distributions (like serial interval
distribution), which I have never heard about.

"One could fit an exponential in many different ways. This post suggests doing the down-and-dirty lm on the log of the response variable. This SO post suggests using nls which requires a starting estimate. This SO post suggests glm with a gamma/log link function. Here, the illustrious @Glen-b explains some potential differences between approaches.

What are the pros/cons and domains of applicability for these different approaches? Do these methods differ in how well or in what way they calculate confidence intervals?

Like all the other data scientists at home right now, I'm messing around with Covid 19 data.

One thing in particular I noticed is that I can do lm with log, log10, log2 etc., but would have to convert from natural log with glm.

","One of the differences is the likelihoods for each model.  In case readers can't remember, the likelihood encapsulates assumptions about the conditional distribution of the data.  In the case of COVID-19, this would be the distribution of infections (or reported new cases, or deaths, etc) on the given day.  Whatever we want the outcome to be, let's call it $y$.  Thus, the conditional distribution (e.g. the number of new cases today) would be $y\vert t$ (think of this as $y$ conditioned on $t$).


In the case of taking the log and then performing lm, this would mean that $\log(y)\vert t \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu(x), \sigma^2) $.  Equivalently, that $y$ is lognormal given $t$. The reason we do linear regression on $\log(y)$ is because on the log scale, the conditional mean is independent of the variance, where as the mean of the log normal is also a function of the variance. So Pro: we know how to do linear regression, but Con This approach makes linear regression assumptions on the log scale which can always be assessed but might be hard to theoretically justify?  Another con is that people do not realize that predicting on the log scale and then taking the exponential actually biases predictions by a factor if $\exp(\sigma^2/2)$ if I recall correctly.  So when you make predictions from a log normal model, you need to account for this.  
So far as I understand, nls assumes a Gaussian likelihood as well, so in this model $ y \vert t \sim \mathcal{N}(\exp(\beta_0 + \beta t), \sigma^2)$.  Except now, we let the conditional mean of the outcome be non-linear.  This can be a pain because no confidence intervals are not bounded below by 0, so your model might estimate a negative count of infections.  Obviously, that can't happen.  When the count of infections (or whatever) is larger, then a Gaussian can justifiable.  But when things are just starting, then this probably isn't the best likelihood.  Furthermore, if you fit your data using nls, you'll see that it fits later data very well but not early data.  That is because misfitting later data incurrs larger loss and the goal of nls is to minimize this loss.
The approach with glm frees is a little and allows us to control the conditional distribution as well as the form of the conditional mean through the link function. In this model, $y \vert t \sim \text{Gamma}(\mu(x), \phi)$ with $\mu(x) = g^{-1}(\beta_0 + \beta_1)$.  We call $g$ the link, and for the case of log link $\mu(x) = \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 t)$. Pro These models are much more expressive, but I think the power comes from the ability to perform inference with a likelihood which is not normal.  This lifts a lot of the restrictions, for example symmetric confidence intervals. The Con is that you need a little more theory to understand what is going on.

"I am interested in creating a web tool to predict the absolute risk of in-hospital death from a published risk model of COVID-19 patients.  

Is it possible to estimate the intercept from the significant, multivariable model coefficients published(Table 3 at https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3)?
","No, for a few reasons.  The most relevant is that, even if you could numerically determine the value of the intercept term in the model, you would not be able to tell what conditions are represented by the intercept term of the model fit by the researchers (unless they provided some very specific details about their methods, e.g., ""did they center their predictors"", etc.).

The way these models are defined, you need to know what the ""reference"" point of each coefficient is.  By convention the reference point for continuous variables is often zero, but the choice of reference is completely arbitrary for categorical variables (though it does appear to be stated in the article).

On a more conceptual note, models like this one are often limited in their ability to predict accurate ""class probabilities ""because their goal is to explain relationships between predictors, or to describe relative risk-reducing or risk-increasing relationships among the predictors in the model.  Often these models use only a limited number of variables to arrive at a parsimonious model, which tries to keep multicollinearity low, so that the individual effects of predictors are easier to interpret.  

Another way of looking at it is this:  The model may have been designed to address research questions  such as: ""what is the relative importance of age with respect to the risk of an in-hospital death after controlling for other demographic factors?"".  Even if the model does this very well, it may be very bad at answering fundamentally different questions, such as ""What is the probability that a female will experience an in-hospital death?""

"I'm interested in learning more about sampling a changing population over time. For example, these statistics from the University of Washington coronavirus testing show a 7% positive rate day after day. Some news outlets are interpreting this as a positive: ""One encouraging sign is that in Washington State, which had an early outbreak, the number of positive tests appears stable.""

http://depts.washington.edu/labmed/covid19/
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-outcomes.html

Can someone suggest a branch of statistics or papers for further study that would help me assess the veracity of such claims? My intuitive reasoning, as described below, shows why I am questioning the optimistic interpretation, but I would like to learn a more formalized framework.



For instance, let's say that the population proportion that tests positive for an attribute is 7%, and that proportion is stable. If I took a random sample each day, I should be getting 7% consistently, subject to some variance.

However, let's say the population proportion is subject to change over time. Let's also add the assumption that I am trying to prioritize sampling people (without replacement) that I believe are most likely to be positive. Eventually I will sample the whole population. Under these new assumptions, if the population proportion were stable, you would expect my initial sample proportions to overshoot, and my final sample proportions to under shoot as I ran out of likely positives. That would imply that if my sample proportion was constant and did NOT drift down over time, then my population proportion MUST be increasing over time. And if my sample proportion was increasing over time, then my population proportion must be increasing by a heck of a lot over time.

These are just qualitative conclusions I can come to. Is there a branch of statistics I can learn about to help me make concrete conclusions about a changing population proportion given sample proportions over time? I am sure that as you vary the sample size across time, the conclusions also change. Any framework to help understand the tweaks and their effects would be great.

Thank you.
","OK, the service area is likely many hundreds of thousands for the U of Washington and for certain patients covers a five state area. The detection rate for a tertiary/quaternary referral center reflects the patient selection process, same criteria for referring patients in distress might lead to same detection rate. However, more precisely one cannot make inferences on that basis because the criteria for patient selection for testing is an uncontrolled variable.

To explain this a bit more, a primary or community hospital would refer patients to a larger regional hospital which refers patients to a specialized tertiary care hospital, and for certain problems, tertiary care hospitals would send patients to a quaternary care facility. Even more complicated, a local physician in the community, might refer a patient directly to a quaternary care facility, or the patient might walk in to the emergency room off of the street.  So, there are so many confounders that any correlation  you might make risks being spurious. BTW, the raw data you linked to was not organized for peer review, I review for 17 medical journals, and I am telling you as simply as I can that without controlling for the referral pattern, there is only limited use for the raw data.

"Recently there are a lot of datapoints regarding COVID-19 related deaths. However I am looking to see how big the impact of non-diagnosed patients is.

Therefore I want to evaluate the deaths (corrected for reported virus deaths) and see how these compare to the same period in recent years.

I understand it is best practice to avoid asking for specific data sets here, so I will keep my question as generic as possible and ask for leniency:

Does anyone know how to find (or search for) recent mortality statistics? Ideally this would be ""per day per country up to today"", but even ""a total for February in a continent or city would already be insightful"".



What have I tried so far: 


Searching recent mortality, this only results in virus related statistics
Searching for several countries or WHO, this did not result in anything for this year

","It doesn't seem like the death toll is clearly showing up (yet). 

For instance, Europe has almost up to 10 000 deaths in a single day during the peak of a heavy respiratory season, and the Covid-19 cases will only be a small bump, in relation to the overall burden of disease.

But, that would be playing down the impact of the virus. It is difficult to look at the overall death rate. Many people are dying every day. We can not easily compare a single cause to the total amount of deaths that are occurring.

Important to consider is that Covid-19 deaths have a non-homogeneous spatial distribution and locally there's a high density that's not clear in common (public) databases that (mostly) present aggregate numbers. Also, the outbreak is still young and is not yet fully processed in databases. So with better data we might be better able to see the impact of the disease (I suspect that the agencies have better information).

So the fact that we currently see little influence of Covid-19 on aggregated statistics of death rate is not reassuring because it is meaningless to look at aggregated statistics (this depends a bit on your philosophy about nature and death though, personally I feel we are overreacting, but that is completely different from statistics). 

See also this note from EuroMomo


  Note concerning COVID-19 related mortality as part of the all-cause mortality figures reported by EuroMOMO
  
  Over the past few days, the EuroMOMO hub has received many questions about the weekly all-cause mortality data and the possible contribution of any COVID-19 related mortality. Some wonder why no increased mortality is observed in the reported mortality figures for the COVID-19 affected countries.
  The answer is that increased mortality that may occur primarily at subnational level or within smaller focal areas, and/or concentrated within smaller age groups, may not be detected at the overall national level. This even more so in the pooled European-wide analysis, given the large total population denominator. Furthermore, there is always a few weeks of delay in death registration and reporting. Hence, the EuroMOMO mortality figures for the most recent weeks must be interpreted with some caution.
  Therefore, although increased mortality is currently not being observed in the EuroMOMO figures, this does not mean that increased mortality does not occur in some areas or in some age groups, including mortality related to COVID-19.

"We've all heard a lot about ""flattening the curve"". I was wondering if these curve – that look like bells – can be qualified as Gaussian despite the fact that there is a temporal dimension.


","It seems like there are three questions here:


Is the actual distribution of cases Gaussian? No. 
Are the curves given in the graphic Gaussian? Not quite. I think the red one is a little bit skewed, and the blue one is definitely skewed.
Can plots of a value versus time be considered Gaussian? Yes. 



  In mathematics, a Gaussian function, often simply referred to as a Gaussian, is a function of the form $$f(x) = ae^{-{\frac {(x-b)^{2}}{2c^{2}}}}$$

"Lombardy, a region of Italy, registered many severe cases of COVID-19 in the last few months.
Unfortunately the available data don't allow us to estimate the percentage P of people who contracted the virus in Lombardy (please don't dispute this, but take it as an assumption).
Now, suppose we have a medical test that says wether a person contracted the virus or not (EDIT: let's assume that the test always gives the correct answer). How many people should we test to estimate P with sufficiently small error?

Data are:


10 million people live in Lombardy.
P can be assumed to be at least 4 %.
No assumption can be made about the uniform distribution of P, neither geographically, nor by age, gender or whatever.
A satisfactory error percent on P would be 25%.


A related question is: how could we confirm the estimated error on P once we have the data? For example, could we bootstrap the data?

Thanks
","This is actually a handbook example of determining the sample size needed for estimating binomial proportion (e.g. Jones et al, 2004, Naing, 2003 for other references and examples).

First of all, to make it more precise, we are talking about finding such sample size, that with probability $\alpha$, the difference between the true probability of being infected $p$ and it's estimate $\hat p$ is not greater then $(100\times\delta\,)\%$

$$
\Pr(|p - \hat p| \le \delta p) = \alpha
$$

Given that the target population is large, we would usually assume binomial distribution to represent it, i.e. we say that it is large enough, that the chance of randomly sampling someone more then once is negligible. The distribution is parametrized by probability of ""success"" (here, probability of being infected) $p$ and the number of samples we draw $n$. Let's denote the observed number of infected people as $k$, in such case, $\hat p = k/n$ is the fraction of infected people in the sample and we treat it as an estimate of the number of infected people in the whole population. If we wanted to calculate confidence interval for $\hat p$, we could use normal approximation

$$
\hat p \pm z_\alpha \sqrt{\frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}
$$

where $z_\alpha$ is the ordinate from standard normal distribution, where for $z$ drawn from standard normal distribution we have $\Pr(-z_\alpha &lt; z &lt; z_\alpha) = \alpha$. You are saying, that you'd like to see this interval to be equal to $\hat p \pm \delta p$. As discussed in the linked resources, you can solve this, so that for given $p$, precision $\delta$, and certanity $\alpha$, you can guesstimate the sample size needed

$$
n \approx \Big(\frac{z_\alpha}{\delta p}\Big)^2 \; p(1-p)
$$

Assuming $(100 \times \alpha)\% = 99\%$ confidence interval, we can plot this for different values of $p$, to find out that for $100 \times p &gt; 4 \%$ the needed sample sizes are generally not much larger then $2000$ samples.



For example, for $p=0.04$ ($4\%$ infected) this yields:



&gt; z &lt;- function(alpha) qnorm(alpha)
&gt; n &lt;- function(p, alpha=0.99, delta=0.25) (z(alpha)/(p*delta))^2 * p*(1-p)
&gt; n(0.04)

To convince yourself, you can verify this by simulation, where you would draw $n$ samples from binomial distribution with probability of infection $p$, repeat this procedure $R$ times, and then verify how often was your result not further then $(100 \times \delta) \%$ from the true value:

&gt; set.seed(123)
&gt; sim &lt;- function(p, n, delta, nsim=50000) mean(abs(p - rbinom(nsim, n, p)/n) / p &lt;= delta)
&gt; sim(0.04, 2078, 0.25)
[1] 0.97858


So we wanted to be $99\%$ sure and the approximation gives us, while the in the simulation, in $97.8\%$ cases the result was within the interval. Not bad.

Notice that this is just a simple approximation for the calculation, assuming simple random sampling. In case of whole population locked in their houses, sampling individuals at random may be not as hard as in case of most of the usual surveys. On another hand, things may not go as smooth as planned, or you may be willing to use other sampling schema, to have higher chance for it being representative, what would make calculating it more complicated. Moreover, the tests used aren't perfect and give false results as described, for example by New York Times, or Washington Post, and you'd need to account for that as well. Also you need to remember, there were many examples where such simple problems get more complicated then expected, e.g. social surveys on Trump's support before the election got very wrong, nonetheless that they used state of art survey methodology.

"I'm experiencing some difficulties in the estimation of the parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ for the following discrete-time SIRD (Susceptibles, Infected, Recovered, Dead) model with sampling step of 1 day 

$$\tag{1}\begin{cases}
S_{t}&amp;=S_{t-1}-\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} \\ 
I_{t}&amp;=I_{t-1}+\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}-\beta I_{t-1}-\gamma I_{t-1} \\
R_{t}&amp;=R_{t-1}+\beta I_{t-1} \\
D_{t}&amp;=D_{t-1}+\gamma I_{t-1} \\
\end{cases} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$

that I've found in this paper. In order to find the unknown $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$, I want to use the least squares regression in his closed-form solution. The parameter $N$ is the size of the population under study, so it is known and hasn't to be estimated. 

1 Derivation of the LS estimator

1.1 definitions


Let's consider the dataset $D_T\triangleq\{y_0,\dots,y_T\}$ up to the observation horizon $T$, where $y_t\triangleq[S_t, I_t, R_t, D_t]'$ is the vector of the observed values at time $t$ for the variables $S,I,R,D$. Here $'$ denotes the transpose operation, thus $y_t$ is a column vector in $\mathbb{N}^{4\times1}$;
Let $\theta\triangleq[\alpha, \beta, \gamma]'$ be the generic vector of parameters. The prediction model $\hat{y}_t(\theta)$ is $(1)$, so
$$\tag{2}
    \hat{y}_t(\theta)\triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    S_{t-1}-\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}  \\ 
    I_{t-1}+\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}-\beta I_{t-1}-\gamma I_{t-1}  \\  
    R_{t-1}+\beta I_{t-1} \\  
    D_{t-1}+\gamma I_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots   
$$
with the convention that $\hat{y}_0(\theta)\triangleq 0$;
Let $V_T(\theta)\triangleq \frac{1}{2}\sum _{t=0}^T \|y_t-\hat{y}_t(\theta) \|^2$ the quadratic cost up to $T$. Here $\| \cdot \|$ denotes the euclidian norm. The least square estimator $\theta_\text{LS}$ of the 'real' parameter $\bar{\theta}$ is defined as
$$\tag{3}\theta_\text{LS}\triangleq \arg\min_{\theta \in \mathbb{R^3}} V_T (\theta)$$
i.e. the minimum for the cost $V_T$.


1.2 analitic solution of $(3)$ 

the idea to solve $(3)$ is to use the standard technique by solving with respect to $\theta$ the equation
$$\tag{4}\frac{\partial V_T(\theta)}{\partial \theta}=0$$
the solution is a minimum for $V_T$ since $(3)$ is a convex problem under mild assumptions regarding the dataset $D_T$ (invertibility of the next matrix $R_T$ defined below). In order to solve $(4)$, let's start by observing that the prediction model $(2)$ is linear in their parameters. In fact we can write that
$$\tag{5}\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\varphi_t \theta + y_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$
by introducing the regression matrices in $\mathbb{R^{4\times3}}$
$$\tag{6}\varphi_t \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    -\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\ 
    \phantom{-}\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} &amp; -I_{t-1} &amp; -I_{t-1}  \\  
    0 &amp; \phantom{-}I_{t-1} &amp; 0\\  
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; \phantom{-}I_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$
with the conventions that $\varphi_0, y_{-1}=0$. From $(5)$ it follows straightforward that the gradient of the cost $V_T$ is
$$\tag{7}\begin{align}\frac{\partial V_T(\theta)}{\partial \theta} &amp;= \sum_{t=0}^T - \frac{\partial \hat{y}_t (\theta)}{\partial \theta}[y_t-\hat{y}_t(\theta)]\\
&amp;=-\sum_{t=0}^T \varphi_t'[y_t-(\varphi_t \theta + y_{t-1})] \\
&amp;=\sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t'[\varphi_t \theta - \Delta y_t] \\
&amp;=\left(\sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t '\varphi_t\right)\theta - \sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t'\Delta y_t
\end{align}$$ 
where $\Delta y_t \triangleq y_t-y_{t-1}$. If we introduce the matrix $R_T\in\mathbb{R}^{3\times3}$ and the vector $\tilde{\theta}_T\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
$$\tag{8}R_T\triangleq \sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t '\varphi_t \qquad \tilde{\theta}_T\triangleq \sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t'\Delta y_t$$
the gradient in $(7)$ gets the following final sintetic expression
$$\tag{9}\frac{\partial V_T(\theta)}{\partial \theta} = R_T\theta-\tilde{\theta}_T$$
now, by combining $(4)$ with $(9)$ and by resolving with respect $\theta$, we can finally conclude that the least square estimator that we are searching is
$$\tag{10}\boxed{\theta_\text{LS}=R_T^{-1}\tilde{\theta}_T}$$

2 Naive implementation in Python

2.1 dataset

I want to estimate $\bar{\theta}$ for the COVID-19 epidemy in Italy, so I've built the  dataset by retrieving from worldometers.info the number of infected $I_t$, recovered $R_t$ and dead $D_t$ individuals day by day. Since $S_t+I_t+R_t+D_t=N$ is costant in time, the number of susceptibles day by day is $S_t=N-(I_t+R_t+D_t)$.  

2.2 least squares estimation of the parameters

in order to compute $(10)$, we need: 


to build $\varphi_t$ and $\Delta y_t$. For the former we can use the definition $(6)$, for the latter we can observe that
$$\tag{11} \Delta y_t \triangleq y_t-y_{t-1}=\begin{bmatrix}
    S_t-S_{t-1}  \\ 
    I_t-I_{t-1}  \\  
    R_t-R{t-1} \\  
    D_t-D_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$ 
to build $R_T$ and $\tilde{\theta}_T$. The idea to compute $(8)$ is to accumulate during the time the products $\varphi_t ' \varphi_t$ and $\varphi_t '\Delta y_t$.


After this 2 simple step the estimation is given by $(10)$.

2.3 simulation  

for the simulation we use the prediction model $(1)$ with the least squares parameters that we have just found. For the initial condition of the simulation I consider the situation where in the population there is only one infected individual that spreads the  disease to the other people.

$$\begin{cases}
S_{0}&amp;=N-1 \\ 
I_{0}&amp;=1 \\
R_{0}&amp;=0 \\
D_{0}&amp;=N-(S_0+I_0+R_0) \\
\end{cases}$$
here the starting number of dead individuals is obtained by imposing the costraint $S_0+I_0+R_0+D_0=N$.

the prediction model doesn't work well, this is the plot of the prediction errors between the observed data and the predicted data.



I can't understand if somewhere I have made some mistake or if the estimation that I'm using cannot provide good predictions. 
","1

Your equation number 5 should be

$$\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\varphi_t \theta + \hat{y}_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$

instead of

$$\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\varphi_t \theta + y_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$

2

Also you compute the derivative $\varphi$ based on the matrix that contains values of $S, I ,R, D$ that are the observed values, but $\varphi$ should relate to the modeled values.

I am not sure whether you can continue your attempt to solve this analytically after correcting those mistakes. It looks a bit like how people solve equations with the finite element method and potentially you could solve it in that way as well (but it will be an approximation in terms of polynomial functions, and is not exact). 

Another way to solve it is to put the equations as a function, and have some solver optimize it (you can have the solver estimate the gradient). You can read about that here: Fitting SIR model with 2019-nCoV data doesn&#39;t conververge

In addition: You can recast the equations into a single differential equation. For the SIR model this is demonstrated here:

Tiberiu Harko, Francisco S. N. Lobo, M. K. Mak  Exact analytical solutions of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model and of the SIR model with equal death and birth rates arXiv:1403.2160 [q-bio.PE]

The SIRD model is almost analogous. It is nearly the same model, with only the R split up in two. So you can use this differential equation to make initial estimates of parameters. 



Also

Fitting this kind of data to some model might be a bad idea. The SIR type of models are some sort of logistic growth type models where the growth starts approximately exponentially but eventually the growth rate decreases. It is due to such terms like $dI/dt = I * (factor)$ where the factor is decreasing as $I$ (and $R$ and $D$) grow (in the case of logistic growth the factor is $1-I$, for the SIRD model it a bit more sophisticated but not much different).

However, in the case of the corona epidemic, you get a decrease in the growth rate for a multitude of reasons.


Weather changes ($R_0$ is not a constant)
Spatial distribution (This virus spreads in from place to place, and should not be considered with compartmental models that assume homogeneous mixing; a person in Milan is much more likely to infect their family, neighbors, co-workers than a random person in the rest of Lombardy)
Stochastic Time effects. The article that you refer to tries to bring autocorrelation into the mixture, but you also have some stochastic behavior, people are not gonna get sick exactly at the same time. Some people will get sick earlier than others and this will be according to some function that increases in time and that will make an increase of cases or deaths that might appear as an exponential growth that relates to a transmission model, but it might be not. 
Sampling bias. We can also see rapid increase in the sampling due to biassed sampling. Definitions of the disease are changing (this gave a rapid bump in the curve for Chinese), tests might be limited (several countries are limiting their testing which might give false ideas of reduction in the growth of the cases), positive reinforcement (once people have discovered the disease suddenly many other cases might become assigned to the same cause, and this may potentially occur inaccurate because a single cause of death is not always possible to assign)

The last to points Sampling Bias and Stochastic time behavior might have occured in the outbreak of SARS (2003) in Amoy Gardens where hundreds of people got sick in a very short time frame. Instead of fitting a model to it, one could also assume that all these hundreds of cases were infected by a single person (and that might be a more likely scenario). Possibly such a situation may have occurred in Italy as well, an initial heavy seeding by unnoticed cases that is now spreading with some time effect and causes the initial exponential decrease (currently the growth looks more like a quadratic curve).
Last but not least, people respond to the virus which may cause it's spread to increase/decrease. Currently heavy measures have been taken and this restricts to a large extend the ability of the virus to spread. You can not model this with a model that has parameters that are constant in time (well, you can, but the outcome will be meaningless)


The logistic SIR type models will interpret all those reasons for a reduction in the growth rate as a reproduction rate very close to 1 or a low population parameter (you fixed it at the size of the population under study, but this is arbitrary, and also not everybody is gonna be susceptible, possibly many people might have some sort of immunity and get little infected, e.g. a Hoskin's effect or some other effect might make only/mostly the elderly population susceptible).

This makes the seemingly mechanistic model, meaningless regarding the parameters. The outcome will be unrealistic.
"
"I'm going to post a question related to the current events and I think it could be very interesting.

In the midst of the crisis with the coronavirus, Croatian capital of Zagreb was hit by a strong earthquake on March 22. Since a lot of people escaped their homes in panic, there were fears that the earthquake would cause an increase in the cases of coronavirus since people didn't obey the rules of social distancing when they escaped outside due to the earthquake.

The Director of the Croatian Institute for Public Health, Krunoslav Capak, said that they conducted some preliminary analyses that suggest that the earthquake didn't cause an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. The analyses are preliminary becuase the incubation period of the virus is known to be as long as 14 days, so it's possible that the effect is not visible yet.

Regardless of the incubation period length, I was confused by Capak's statement because I cannot think of a statistical method I would use to make that inference. Does anyone know what analyses was Capak referring to? What statistical analyses would be appropriate to determine if there was an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Croatia due to the earthquake?

The number of coronavirus cases in Croatia can be found here: https://github.com/viborccom/data/blob/master/covid-19/croatia/time-series.csv?fbclid=IwAR2ekRN44WnKwlTQJAgpfYyJTz01GedrqJupB28d-g_KoGBnroIGWt8Jb58
","You might wonder whether an increased infection rate during a short period could be observed in the figures of reports on infected cases or the death rate.

However, this is not feasible with the data available


The effect get's diluted The effect is likely to be very small in the observations (unless the infection rate is very large). 


If there is an increase in transmission then this will occur only in a small group, which gets diluted by the larger total number of Zagreb and the surroundings. 
Also the time of the event is only very short and the contact between people is very local. Social distancing is 'the way to go', but it matters with which persons and how long you have contact. 

Complete strangers in a supermarket are much more a risk than your neighbors (if your neighbors got the virus than you are already at high risk to get the virus as well, being outside is not gonna change this a lot). There is a large multitude of ways how the virus can spread. If we are traveling a lot, moving around over long distances, then the virus is moving a large distance quickly and will infect a lot of people quickly. The local transmission is of less concern (in terms of speed of transmission, and flattening the curve, the local transmission is eventually determining how many people get sick. The long range transmission is determining how fast people get sick*).

Ad hoc ergo propter hoc Even if there is a change in the trend/growth in the number of infections or the number of death cases, then it will be very difficult to connect this observation to a specific event. There are too many variables that are changing such that it is not possible to draw strong conclusions about causal relationships based on correlations.

The current cases in Zagreb and Croatia are very small. So the number will be expected to rise, already without an earthquake. This rise will occur with lots of uncertainty**. The information and background information is so noisy that it is not possible to make a lot of sensible predictions.

See the past reports on the cases below. The curve is not a nice straight line and is varying in growth rate and bumpy. It is very difficult to make a specific relation between specific events and this curve. That is because the time between infection, start of symptoms, and start of registration/confirmation occurs with an unknown delay.


Time delay Also, there is a delay in reporting of the numbers. This makes the above effects count stronger. It will take two weeks before the effect of increased transmission is measurable. But at that time many more events have happened which may cause an effect as well. And also the time delay is a random value. What happens now in a single day, will not create a sudden peak of a single day two weeks later, but instead it gets spread out over multiple days and becomes less noticeable (and then there are also large high noise levels in the measurements which might be a fourth point). 
denominator. Furthermore, there is always a few weeks of delay in death registration and reporting. Hence, the EuroMOMO mortality figures for the most recent weeks must be interpreted with some caution.




*A simple model that shows how the reduction in the long-range transmission is having a strong effect and going on the streets and have local community spread is slightly less worrisome. I used the code from this answer which made used of a $R_0$ for short distance transmission and a $R_1$ for long distance transmission. I did two computations, one with $R_1 = 0.25 , R_0 = 2.25$ and one with one with $R_1 = 0 , R_0 = 2.5$. The total reproduction rate, $2.5$, is the same, but the models deviate quickly once the infection reaches the edges of the neighborhood.

**In the Netherlands the officials were counting on a very specific rise of cases in the Intensive Care. Now... they are surprised that it did not turn out to be that specific number and it is a larger number than predicted (they were expecting 1600 people in the Intensive Care at some date, and not this is gonna happen a week earlier than expected)

Me... I am surprised that they are surprised about the number turning out to be different. These sort of predictions should have been made with a very wide confidence interval indicating that there is very little certainty about the forecasts.

"0 Introduction

This is my third attempt in tuning a good prediction SIRD model for the COVID-19 outbreak. The model in question is the following:
$$\tag{12}\begin{cases}
S_{t}&amp;=S_{t-1}-\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} \\ 
I_{t}&amp;=I_{t-1}+\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}-\beta I_{t-1}-\gamma I_{t-1} \\
R_{t}&amp;=R_{t-1}+\beta I_{t-1} \\
D_{t}&amp;=D_{t-1}+\gamma I_{t-1} \\
\end{cases} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$



0.1 first attempt

In my first try I've used for the estimation of the parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ a very simple strategy by searching the least squares parameters that minimize the quadratic cost of the 1-step prediction along all the observation horizon. The complete dissertation of this problem is here (note: in this thread I will use the same notations that I've used in the cited thread).
The estimation problem is very easy to resolve, but leads to a result with very poor performances.



0.2 second attempt

As Sextus Empiricus suggests to me, using the 1-step prediction, i.e.
$$\tag{13}\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\varphi_t \theta + y_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$
is not a good idea because, once one has found the parameters, during the simulation phase the model haves to feedback the proper previous predictions. This means, in principle, that the right way to tune the parameters $\theta$ is to minimize some suitable cost function of the prediction errors generated by a ""batch"" predictor of the form
$$\tag{14}\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\hat\varphi(\hat{y}_{t-1}) \theta + \hat{y}_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$
where
$$\tag{15}\hat\varphi(\hat{y}_{t-1}) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    -\frac{\hat{S}_{t-1}\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\ 
    \phantom{-}\frac{\hat{S}_{t-1}\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; -\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; -\hat{I}_{t-1}  \\  
    0 &amp; \phantom{-}\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; 0\\  
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; \phantom{-}\hat{I}_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$
and $\hat{S}_{t-1}, \hat{I}_{t-1}$ are predictions (and not observed values) generated by the model. As a consequence, the new estimation problem 
$$\tag{16}\theta_\text{LS}\triangleq \arg\min_{\theta \in \mathbb{R^3}} V_T (\theta)$$
with the same quadratic cost $V_T(\theta)\triangleq \frac{1}{2}\sum _{t=0}^T \|y_t-\hat{y}_t(\theta) \|^2$ is not easy anymore because now the considered model $(14)$ is not linear in his parameter $\theta$.

To resolve $(16)$, under the suggestion Sextus Empiricus, I've chosen a numerical approach. More precisely, I've used a simple gradient descent equipped with Armijo's adaptive learning rate / step update, with a simple finite-difference approximation of the gradient. The optimization works pretty well, but from the starting guess $\theta_{\text{LS},0}=0$ converges to a parameter $\theta_{\text{LS},\infty}$ with a non-zero cost that doesn't satisfies me in the final simulation phase.

I've tried several different optimizations by using randomly different initializations $\theta_{\text{LS},0}$ (like a MultiStart global optimization policy) with even worse results. 



0.3 third attempt

I'm quite sure that the optimizer works well, so I believe that to improve the performance of the final simulator it is necessary to increase the expressivity of the model $(12)$.
To make a step ahead towards an acceptable solution, under the observations of Sextus Empiricus, now I want make an attempt where I increase the difficult of the estimation problem by relaxing the time-invariance hypothesis of the parameters. Thus, now I consider this more complicated model 
$$\tag{17}\begin{cases}
S_{t}&amp;=S_{t-1}-\alpha_t\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} \\ 
I_{t}&amp;=I_{t-1}+\alpha_t\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}-\beta_t I_{t-1}-\gamma_t I_{t-1} \\
R_{t}&amp;=R_{t-1}+\beta_t I_{t-1} \\
D_{t}&amp;=D_{t-1}+\gamma_t I_{t-1} \\
\end{cases} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$
The actual ""dynamic"" estimation problem can be solved by using a Kalman filter.

note: as mentioned by Sextus Empiricus, another possible approach to the problem is to tune the parameters by using the explicit solution of the SIRD model. I don't want follow this way because, as a student in control system engineering, I'm interested in learn how to identify generic dynamical systems in their implicit state-space representations. The SIRD problem is a ""toy example"" that I'm trying to resolve better as possible in my quarantine free-time. 

1 Kalman Filtering

1.1 dynamic system model

Consider the following linear, time-variant and autonomous state-space model for a dynamic system 
$$\tag{18}\begin{cases} x_{t+1} &amp;= A_t x_t+w_t \\ y_t &amp;= C_t x_t+v_t \end{cases}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots$$
where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the state vector, $y \in \mathbb{R}^p$ is the output vector of the system and the parameters $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $C \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times n}$ are matrices. The signals $w\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $v\in \mathbb{R}^p$ are white noises characterized respectively by null mean values and covariances $Q\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$  and $R\in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$, i.e.
$$\begin{align} w_t &amp;= \text{wn}(0,Q_t) \\ v_t &amp;= \text{wn}(0,R_t) \end{align}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{19}$$



1.2 Kalman filter definition 

The Kalman filter is another dynamic system that estimates dynamically the state of the system $(18)$ by watching the model $(18)$ and a dataset $D\triangleq\{y_0, y_1, y_2, \dots\}$ of observed outputs. The estimation process is a recursion starting from the initial state $x_0$, that is unknown and modelled as a random variable with mean value $\hat{x_0}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and covariance $P_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, i.e.
$$\tag{20} x_0 \sim (\hat{x}_0, P_0)$$
At every time instant $t=1,2,3,\dots$ the recursion is splitted in two different steps:


correction: the filter computes the estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t}$ of the state $x_t$ by considering all the observed past values $y_0,y_1, \dots, y_{t-1}$, summarized in a predicted estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$, and the actual observation $y_t$. Such estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t}$ is characterized by the covariance $P_{t|t}$; 
prediction: the filter computes the estimate $\hat{x}_{t+1|t}$ of the state $x_{t+1}$ by considering the first equation of the model $(18)$. Such estimate $\hat{x}_{t+1|t}$ is characterized by the covariance $P_{t+1|t}$. 


the Kalman filter algorithm is the following
$$\boxed{\begin{align} 
\text{FOR}\quad &amp;t=1,2,3,\dots :\\
&amp;e_t \triangleq y_t - C_t \hat{x}_{t|t-1} \\
&amp;S_t \triangleq  C_t P_{t|t-1}C_t'+R_t \\
&amp;L_t \triangleq  P_{t|t-1}C_t' S_t ^{-1} \\
&amp;\text{1) correction}\\
&amp;\hat{x}_{t|t} \triangleq \hat{x}_{t|t-1}+L_t e_t \\
&amp;P_{t|t} \triangleq (I-L_t C_t)P_{t|t-1}(I-L_t C_t)'+L_t R_t L_t'\\
&amp;\text{2) prediction}\\
&amp;\hat{x}_{t+1|t} \triangleq A_t \hat{x}_{t|t}\\
&amp;P_{t+1|t} \triangleq A_t P_{t|t}A_t'+ Q_t
\end{align}}\tag{21}$$
note: if $x_0$, $w_t$, $v_\tau$, are gaussians and incorrelated for all the possible choices of $t, \tau$ then at every time istant $t$ the estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t}$ is by definition the MMSE estimate of the state $x_t$, so the Kalman Filter finds the optimal estimation of the state $x_t$.

note: the signal $e_t$ is called innovation and it is the prediction error of the output of the system $(18)$ (since the predicted output generated by the Kalman filter is $\hat{y}_{t|t-1}=C_t \hat{x}_{t|t-1}$). Here the matrix $S_t$ is the covariance of the innovation (and not the number of susceptibles at time $t$, I hope that it is clear from the context when I'm talking about the innovation covariance or the number of susceptibles). The matrix $L_t$ is called correction gain since it is used to define the corrected estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t}$. The matrix $I$ is an identity matrix $n \times n$.

note: the initialization is $\hat{x}_{1|0}\triangleq \hat{x}_0$, $P_{1|0} \triangleq P_0$.



1.3 application to the SIRD estimation problem: static estimation

Before to jump in to the more general problem that involves the model $(17)$, I want to use the Kalman filter to make a more simpler ""static"" estimation of the parameters.
In order to use the Kalman filter, the idea is to define the following non-linear, time-variant, static system
$$\begin{cases}x_{t+1} &amp;=x_t+w_t \\
y_t &amp;=h_t(x_t)+v_t\end{cases}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{22}$$
where 
$$x_t \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    \alpha_t  \\ 
    \beta_t  \\  
    \gamma_t \\  
\end{bmatrix} \qquad 
y_t \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    S_t  \\ 
    I_t  \\  
    R_t \\  
    D_t 
\end{bmatrix} \qquad 
h_t(x_t) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    {S}_{t-1}-\frac{{S}_{t-1}{I}_{t-1}}{N}\alpha_t \\ 
    {I}_{t-1}-{I}_{t-1}\beta_t-{I}_t\gamma_t+\frac{{S}_{t-1}{I}_{t-1}}{N}\alpha_t  \\  
    {R}_{t-1}+{I}_{t-1}\beta_t \\  
    {D}_{t-1}+{I}_{t-1}\gamma_t 
\end{bmatrix} \\ \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{23}
$$
the system $(22)$ is not linear, so the idea to deal with this problem is to consider a simple linearization around the estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$of the output equation (like in an extended Kalman filter). 
$$y_t \approx h_t(\hat{x}_{t|t-1})+\frac{\partial h_t}{\partial x_t}\Bigg|_{x_t=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}}(x_t-\hat{x}_{t|t-1})+v_t \tag{24}$$
by defining the new coordinates
$$\tilde{y}_t \triangleq y_t-h_t(\hat{x}_{t|t-1}) \qquad \tilde{x}_t \triangleq x_t -\hat{x}_{t|t-1} \tag{25}$$
and the time-variant matrix
$$C_t \triangleq \frac{\partial h_t}{\partial x_t}\Bigg|_{x_t=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}}=\begin{bmatrix}
    -\frac{\hat{S}_{t-1}\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\ 
    \phantom{-}\frac{\hat{S}_{t-1}\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; -\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; -\hat{I}_{t-1}  \\  
    0 &amp; \phantom{-}\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; 0\\  
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; \phantom{-}\hat{I}_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \tag{26}$$
the system $(22)$ is approximated by the linear system
$$\begin{cases}\tilde{x}_{t+1} &amp;=\tilde{x}_t+w_t \\
\tilde{y}_t &amp;=C_t \tilde{x}_t+v_t\end{cases}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{27}$$
at this point it is possible to apply the Kalman filter $(21)$ to get an estimation for the parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$.



1.4 application to the SIRD estimation problem: dynamic estimation

In order to take into account the time dependency of the parameters it is sufficient to modify the first equation of the system $(22)$ in a suitable way that reflects approximately the real dynamic of the parameters
$$\begin{cases}x_{t+1} &amp;=f_t(x_t)+w_t \\
y_t &amp;=h_t(x_t)+v_t\end{cases}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{28}$$
in other words, the dynamic of the parameters $\alpha_t, \beta_t,\gamma_t$ is described by the motion model $f_t(x_t)$. To get an estimate of theese parameters it is possible to use an extended Kalman filter like in the previous section 1.3. 



2 My Questions

Before to writing down some code to get experimental responses, I'd like to have some suggestions about the previous dissertation. I have also two questions.


I'm not sure that $C_t$ is well defined. Let's assume that his definition $(26)$ is correct. Since the prediction model is $(14)$, that is a dynamic model, the quantities $\hat{S}_{t-1}$ and $\hat{I}_{t-1}$ are functions of all the previous predictions $\hat{y}_0 (\theta=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}),\hat{y}_1 (\theta=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}), \dots, \hat{y}_{t-2} (\theta=\hat{x}_{t|t-1})$. This means that at every time step the computational burden to get $C_t$ increase because it requires the simulation with the actual parameter $\theta=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$ of the system $(12)$ up to time $t-2$ (that is increasing). It is possible to define a more efficient recursive formula to define $C_t$?
How can we define a reasonable motion model $f_t(x_t)$ that can take into account the observations made by Sextus Empiricus in the reply in my first thread?

","Nice write-up. I think eq#23 is not quite correct though. The observation $y_t$ should be a function of the state $x_t$ and noise $v_t$, like you said in eq#22 $y_t = h(x_t) + v_t$.

The issue with eq#23 is that $y_t$ depends on $y_{t-1}$. This would break the Markov assumption that $x_t$ is a sufficient state, which is foundational to the Kalman filter formulation.

I think the correct approach is to use
$$
x_t := \begin{bmatrix} S_t \\ I_t \\ R_t \\ D_t \\ \alpha_t \\ \beta_t \\ \gamma_t \end{bmatrix}
$$

This would be considered ""augmenting the state"" (SIRD) with the parameters ($\alpha$,$\beta$,$\gamma$) to do a ""joint-state-parameter"" estimation.

Your dynamic would be
$$
x_{t+1} =\begin{bmatrix}
    {S}_{t}-\frac{{S}_{t}{I}_{t}}{N}\alpha_t \\ 
    {I}_{t}-{I}_{t}\beta_t-{I}_t\gamma_t+\frac{{S}_{t}{I}_{t}}{N}\alpha_t  \\  
    {R}_{t}+{I}_{t}\beta_t \\  
    {D}_{t}+{I}_{t}\gamma_t \\ f_\alpha(x_t)\\f_\beta(x_t) \\ f_\gamma(x_t)
\end{bmatrix} + w_t
$$

You can treat the SIRD part of the dynamic as deterministic if you so desire by setting its entries of the covariance $Q_t$of $w_t$ to $0$, though that places all the uncertainty on the initial condition and parameters, which I don't think accurately reflects reality - the SIRD model isn't perfect even with best-fit parameters.

Your observation model would be the actual data, which we'd consider to be measurements of the SIRD part of the state, corrupted by noise (which you can remove by making its covariance $R_t \approx 0$ if you think the SIRD records are perfect).
$$
y_t = \begin{bmatrix} S_t \\ I_t \\ R_t \\ D_t \end{bmatrix} + v_t
$$

As for what you should design for $f_\alpha(x_t)$ and the other parameter dynamics, I think a random walk is fine (i.e. $f_\alpha(x_t) = \alpha_t$ so all the movement is due to the $\alpha$-component of $w_t$). But really I think designing a more sophisticated structure for that is a matter of studying epidemiology more. By creating a structured dynamic for the parameters, you are essentially making a more detailed model than what SIRD alone captures. Such an advanced design should probably be rooted in hard science, else it just becomes excess model capacity ripe for overfitting / poor generalization.

In other words, if you want a model for how the parameters would move, you should come up with an explanation / mechanism for why they would move. What do these parameters mean - what dynamical factors would influence them?

By the way, the selection of the noise covariances is pretty critical to the usefulness of the Kalman filter. If you are using them as tuning knobs rather than estimating them from data, you might as well just go back to your second approach (nonlinear regression of a multi-step predictor) and just use Gauss-Newton's method instead of gradient descent for optimization. The extended Kalman filter is essentially a covariance-weighted recursive application of Gauss-Newton least-squares.

"I used a Log-Likelihood Estimation (Poisson) Objective Function to estimate and fit a curve to a data of reported infected cases of COVID-19 using SEIR model in order to estimate its coefficients. How can I calculate the 95% confidence intervals for these estimated coefficients?

Thank you
","You can use a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the variation of the parameters. Such method is explained in this blogpost https://blog.ephorie.de/contagiousness-of-covid-19-part-i-improvements-of-mathematical-fitting-guest-post 

Also you can estimate the variance of parameters based on the Fisher information matrix which can be approximated with the second-order derivative of an empirical likelihood function (based on your MLE and estimate of deviance). 

I am sure that there are several posts about this already on this Q&amp;A site. If you search for 'variance of parameter estimates' or something like that you might find out more.

"Wuhan flu is a very hot topic right now, and I have seen at least two papers and several bloggers attempt to model the $\mathcal{R}_0$ of the disease using the reported data on wikipedia.

The problem I have is that most of these approaches use a Guassian likelihood to get point estimates, and while that may be a good approximation, the uncertainty estimates would be more than wrong.  Consider for a moment that if there are $x$ reported cases of the flu then there can be more cases we have not seen, but not fewer.  The likelihood for any model should respect this property (that our observations can under estimate the true prevalence of the disease at a given time, but can not over estimate it).

What would be an appropriate likelihood for this process?  I imagine it would almost look like a flipped pareto distirbution. Interested in hearing your thoughts.
","Too early to fit models with $R_0$ (with only data about the number of infected people).

The larger problem is that the development is still in the exponential phase and we can not model the decrease of the exponential growth rate. See also this question: Fitting SIR model with 2019-nCoV data doesn&#39;t conververge In that framework (SIR model) the only variable that can be accurately determined is $\beta - \gamma$ but $R_0 = \beta/\gamma$ is still difficult to determine (but it seems to be $\beta-\gamma \approx 0.4 &gt; 0$ thus we at least know that $R_0&gt;1$).

See also the comment at the end of that answer about the use of only a time series in the number of infected people. That number does not provide a good measure of $R_0$, but it is auxiliary information that is being used. For instance direct estimates of $\gamma$ the parameter relating to how long people remain infectious (by observing how the virus has spread, rather than just using the quantitative numbers).



regarding your problem/question

Binomial distribution

One might model the reported cases as a binomial distributed variable. The observed/reported cases will be some fraction $p$ of the underlying real cases (in more advanced models this fraction could be variable depending on time and the number of cases). But the current data do not allow to study this (potentially one can fill in the gaps based on studies on a wider set of epidemical data). 

Given such situation (a binomial distributed fraction) one would expect that the variance is related to the mean by a factor between 0 and 1 (binomial distribution has $\mu = np$ and $var = npq$). However when we plot an exponential curve to the data then we currently get RSS being a factor 4 larger than the sum of means. Thus there is posibly overdispersion instead of underdispersion (although it is not yet a good accurate measure*).

*With so little data we can not be sure. In addition the model is not so great (as you say the approaches use simple Gaussian likelihood). One might use some correlation in the errors. I imagine that this is a potential source of overdispersion.

Poisson distribution for increments

There is new/recent an R package available on github that aims to model this specific epidemic:

https://rdrr.io/github/chrism0dwk/wuhan/

This model models an ODE according to a SEIR model and uses data that is separated for individual regions (combining this wit hthe population size in those regions and the transport in between those regions). 

The predictions from the model are compared with the observations by comparing the increments and assuming that these increments are Poisson distributed. 



Is there enough data?

The exponential model in the above graph does not fit accurately the data (although I would say the exponential fit is sufficient, still one might desire some more complex fit to learn more). One could make the fits more complex, possibly the factors that determine the dynamics are not constant in time. 

But, one may wonder what could be achieved by making the model more complex. I do not see what could be achieved. The data shows a reasonable exponential curve, and I do not believe that we should try to squeeze more out of the present data.

Potentially, one could incorporate more background information, and then some sort of simulations**, and a more Bayesian approach, could be interesting in order to project into the future what we could see (but this will lean mostly on prior information and those 12 data points do not provide a lot of information).

**Those simulations would also help to handle the correlations mentioned in the previous footnote.

Some interesting view of the data might be the distribution of the increases in the infections from day to day. This increase is not constant in time. We might better regard it as a variable with a random distribution by itself (and model variation in growth curves based on this random variation in the growth rate). Models to use are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion (the likelihood computation by Chris Jewell is also treating the evolution as a random walk by evaluating the observed 'step sizes/ increments')

"Following the recent Coronavirus outbreak, various mortality rates have been published.

Most of these are simply the ratio between the deaths and the total verified cases, which is not a very accurate indicator as many of the verified cases are ongoing and could result in deaths.

I know some statistics from university but I am in no way an expert. I was wondering if there was any commonly used statistical model to predict with some accuracy the mortality rate of an ongoing epidemic. If there is, I'm guessing some of the variables would be the time between the onsetting of symptoms and death/healing for resolved cases.
","A natural (and perhaps naive) way to model mortality would be a binomial model, i.e.,

$$
x \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p)
$$

Here $x$ is the number of deaths, $n$ is the total number of people infected, and $p$ is the mortality rate, or the probability of dying given that you have the disease. 
When we say something is distributed according to a binomial distribution, we mean that the observed counts $x$ are the result of $n$ independent trials, each with probability of ""success"" (in this case, death) $p$. These are usually termed ""Bernoulli trials"".

We can now examine the likelihood of $p$ given $x$ and $n$ -- i.e., how likely it would be to see the data we have observed, given different values of $p$. Imagine we had 100 cases, 50 of which resulted in deaths:

n &lt;- 100
x &lt;- 50
s &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)
plot(
  s, dbinom(x, size = n, prob = s), type=""l"",
  xlab = ""Mortality rate (p)"", ylab = ""Binomial likelihood""
)




This shows that a point estimate (the maximum likelihood estimate) would be 0.5, which of course makes sense. Something important to consider here is the amount of data we have observed. Since we have a good amount of observations, the likelihood is fairly narrow. This means that there is a relatively small range of values for $p$ for which the data we observed would be likely to occur.

Now, imagine if we had only 10 cases, 5 of which resulted in deaths:

x &lt;- 5
n &lt;- 10
s &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)
plot(
  s, dbinom(x, size = n, prob = s), type=""l"",
  xlab = ""Mortality rate (p)"", ylab = ""Binomial likelihood""
)




When we don't have much information, the likelihood is quite broad, indicating that the data would be fairly likely for a wide range of values for $p$.

It can be helpful in cases like this to incorporate a prior, or how likely we think different parameter values are, based on our existing knowledge. For example, imagine that we knew that the distribution of mortality rates across all known human diseases looked something like this:

s &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)
plot(
  s, dbeta(s, 32, 64), type=""l"",
  xlab = ""Mortality rate (p)"", ylab = ""Proportion of diseases""
)




This is a Beta prior with $\alpha=32$ and $\beta=64$, i.e.,
$ p \sim \text{Beta}(32, 64)$.
We might want to use this prior information to guide our inferences about the mortality rate of a new disease for which we have very little information. We can combine this prior information with the likelihoods we've already plotted. If you want details about how this is done, one great starting point is this blog by David Robinson. Basically, the posterior distribution over our parameters is a Beta distribution. For parameters we take the $\alpha$ of our prior and add $x$, and take the $\beta$ of our prior and add $n-x$.

s &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)
n &lt;- 100
x &lt;- 50
plot(
  s, dbeta(s, shape1 = 32 + x, shape2 = 64 + n - x), 
  type=""l"", xlab = ""Mortality rate (p)"", ylab = ""Posterior density""
)




As you can see, this prior information ""pulls"" our estimates downwards towards the distribution of existing mortality rates. However, if we had strong enough evidence (for example, thousands of infections and deaths) we could still produce an estimate outside of where the prior distribution is concentrated. When we have a small amount of data, a prior can be particularly helpful to avoid results that are purely the result of sampling noise - for example, imagine the first 10 people with a disease happen to die, and the next 90 survive. The estimate after 10 people would be 100%, which is extremely unlikely, given what we've seen about human disease in the past.

s &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)
n &lt;- 10
x &lt;- 5
plot(
  s, dbeta(s, shape1 = 32 + x, shape2 = 64 + n - x),
  type=""l"", xlab = ""Mortality rate (p)"", ylab = ""Posterior density""
)




When we have very little data, this prior information really shrinks our estimates towards what we believe is a reasonable estimate of mortality, given what we've observed in the past about other diseases.

You can continually update this posterior distribution as new data comes in  by adding deaths to the $\alpha$ parameter and survivals to the $\beta$ parameter of the Beta distribution.

This is all just general; I have no real expertise in disease modelling. None of the parameters values I've chosen have any basis in reality.

And here for reference Google Ngram, indeed showing the term first appeared in the 1960s:


"
"I collected the latest data on the coronavirus from Johns Hopkins University as shown and fitted different curves to this data to model the relationship between the number of confirmed patients $P$ who are/were infected as function of time $T$ taking 20-Jan-20 as day 1.





As opposed to applying the standard SIR and SEIR I tried out simple curve fitting to see the general trend. The curve fitting software I used has well known models form different branches of science as well as we could build our own custom models which I did as shown in the image below. The score against the name of a model gives how well a model fits this data. The higher the score, the better the fit and the maximum possible score is 1000. Although we have data only for 18 days (as of 7-Feb 2 AM GMT) one model always kept appearing at top as the best fit and this was the vapor pressure model. After checking for various boundary conditions, I rejected many of models but I could not find any immediately reason to reject the vapor pressure model. Similarly when I modeled the number of reported deaths against time, the vapor pressure model once again gave the best fit which for which I could not find any obvious reasons to reject.



So I did some research on the vapor pressure model.

Basic concept of vapor pressure Because the molecules of a liquid $L$ are in constant motion and possess kinetic energies, at any moment some fraction of them has enough energy to escape from the surface of the liquid to enter the gas phase. This process, called evaporation, generates a vapor pressure $P_L$ above the liquid. Molecules in the gas phase can collide with the liquid surface and reenter the liquid via condensation. Eventually, a steady state is reached in which the number of molecules evaporating and condensing per unit time is the same, and the system is in a state of dynamic equilibrium. Under these conditions, a liquid exhibits a characteristic equilibrium vapor pressure that depends only on the temperature $T_L$. Volatile liquids are liquids with high vapor pressures, which tend to evaporate readily from an open container; nonvolatile liquids have low vapor pressures. When the vapor pressure equals the external pressure, bubbles of vapor form within the liquid, and it boils. We can express the nonlinear relationship between vapor pressure and temperature as an almost linear relationship using the Antoine equation. 

$$
P_L = exp\Big(a + \frac{b}{T_L} + c\log T_L\Big)
$$

Next I did some research what is known about how the coronavirus spreads and if it is related to liquids. Here is what I found. 


  How coronavirus spreads: When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they shed droplets of saliva, mucus, or other bodily fluids. If any of those droplets fall on you—or if you touch them and then, say, touch your face—you can become infected as well. Hospital for communicable diseases define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person for 10 minutes or longer. Time and distance matters.


The coronavirus spreads when it escapes from an infected person through microscopic droplets of liquid carrying the virus through air. I wonder this has anything to do with why the vapor pressure model keeps coming on the top as the best fit even though there is no apparent pressure or temperature as in the vapor pressure equation and I cannot see how they could be elated. May be all this just a mere coincidence. 


  As a bad scientist but a concerned human, I thought I must report this
  observation in case there is anything worth in it.


Question: Given this limited data what can we infer about the corona virus growth rate and how can we reject the vapor pressure model as a mere spurious correlation.

Note 1: I am well aware of spurious correlation. But with only 3 weeks of data, we many not be able to detect a different trend this early. Hence I am reporting the best fit regardless.
","""If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."" The dataset you have is small, possibly underrepresented, and of unknown quality, since it is argued that many cases could have not been diagnosed. You observe an exponential growth, a common phenomena in many natural and artificial processes. The curve fits well, but  I'd bet that other similar curves would also fit well.

Notice that the the Antoine equation mentioned by you, is a very flexible one, since it can account for constant ($\alpha$), exponential ($b/T_L$), and linear ($c\log T_L$) growth curves. This makes it easy to fit to many datasets.

Moreover, with this kind of data, it may be harder to model it at early stages. Notice that you could fit a linear growth model to the earliest period. Later, quadratic may fit just fine. Later, exponential would fit better, where the exact rate may be hard to catch, since by definition ""the more it grows, then the more it grows"", and it may easy speed up quite rapidly. It may be easy to fit some curve to such data, but the best test of it, would be a test of time, i.e. validating it on future data.

"A big problem with the current COVID-19 epidemic is the difficulty of getting tested (due to mild symptoms and lack of testing kits). This makes it impossible for patients with little or no symptoms to know how likely it is to be infected and further spreading the disease. 

There are estimations available but only take into account confirmed cases (and range between 10x-1000x of this number). How could one get estimations of the number of patients by using secondary features of the distribution that could be more robust? Age-adjusted death rate under intensive care could be one of several such parameters.


","Death rate

Using death rate may work when people that die have most likely acquired the virus locally. 

However, for the moment, many people die because they acquired the virus during a visit to another area, or because they got it from another person that acquired the virus abroad. 

Thus this death-rate based number is not very accurate unless the virus has fully spread out (in which case it will be more likely to get infected from a local source). 

For the cases of Wuhan, Italy and other epi-centers, which have more spread due to local infections rather than foreign infections, death rate might be a good probe (although you still have to deal with the delay).

In addition, while death rate might be more thrustworthy than total cases of infection (just think about the Germans, with lots of supplies, are testing with a lot of thousands people, while neighboring countries, with limited supplies, are trying to limit the use of testing as much as possible), bit it is still a biased number. It is not easy to determine/pinpoint the cause of death. Often multitude of diseases are present. If a person with cancer or aids gets a pneumonia from nCoV-19, then what is the cause? The sampling of 'cause of death' is not very clear and becomes part of the analysis.

Statistics are only usefull for a comparison when they have a similar underlying basis. 

Travel data

The virus is mostly spreading out irregularly over a network. It spreads out differently at different scales, within the household, neighborhood, workplaces/schools, villages, agglomerations, countries, continents.  You can sort of see the virus spread around with sudden jumps from large node/community to large node/community. 

You can use occurrence of the virus in those nodes/communities as the variable (so you do not count individuals, since we do not know the presence in all individuals, but instead count the much better known presence of the virus in communities), and then use a model for the dynamics of the virus spreading between this different nodes in the network.

For instance. E.g. in region A you encounter x cases of disease among people that came from region B and y cases of disease among people that came from region C, while the travel to those regions is $r$ and $q$, then an estimate of the relative presence of the virus in regions B:C can be approximated by (x/r):(y/q).

I remember there was an early article on the spread of COVID-19 (I believe it was by Chinese scholars) that tried to estimate $R_0$ and included information about the frequency of travel between different regions.



Random tests

You can perform test on a sample from the population that does not show any symptoms and use the prevalence of the virus among this sample to make an estimate about the prevalence in the entire population.

If the prevalence is very small then this requires a very large sample which might be difficult. In that case one may perform the test among a sample where the suspicion of the prevalence is higher and gain some information about how many people have the virus in that group. Such a measure can be used to calibrate the estimates based on incomplete information (ie. along with other information, such as the rate at which people with the virus have the particular mild or severe symptoms, you get an idea about how much the current estimates are underestimating the true number of cases).
"
"This is a strange case of difference in fatality rate between Chinese and Italian covid-19 outbreak.

In my knowledge, fatality rate is a ratio between deaths from a certain disease compared to the total number of subjects diagnosed with the disease.

Starting from this assumption, I attempted to analyze difference in fatality rate between Chinese/Italian outbreak. Herein, I propose a reproducible R example for exploring this variable:

# Import dataset from authoritative source:  
# https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data
covid &lt;- read.csv(""https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/full_data.csv"")

# Subsetting only data from China and Italy
dataset &lt;- subset(covid, location == ""China"" | location == ""Italy"")

# Fatality ratio: is the proportion of deaths from a certain disease compared to the 
# total number of people diagnosed with the disease for a certain period of time.
dataset$fatality &lt;- round(dataset$total_deaths/dataset$total_cases*100, 2)

# Generating plot
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(dataset, aes(as.numeric(date), fatality, color = location, group = location))+
  geom_smooth(size= .5, alpha=.25, color = ""gray65"")+
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x=""Outbreak duration (days)"", y= ""Fatality rate (%)"", color = ""Location"")+
  theme_light(14)

  geom_bar(data=subset(dataset, location == ""China""), 
           aes(as.numeric(date), fatality, fill = ""China""), 
           stat = ""identity"", position = position_dodge(), alpha = .75)+

  geom_bar(data=subset(dataset, location == ""Italy""),

  labs(x=""Outbreak duration (days)"", y= ""Fatality rate (%)"", fill = ""Location"")+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = ""Set1"")+
  theme_light(14)



From this basis, I'm a little bit confused about such difference in terms of fatality rate between the two analyzed countries. In fact, China has the maximum fatality rate at 4%, while Italy at more than 6%. For this reason I've two questions:

1) Is my computation correct?

2) If yes, why such a huge difference in terms of fatality rate? 



EDT II

I would like to improve this question reporting a recent Science paper which can partially explain these differences. In fact, Li et al reported that for each COVID+ patient, other 5-10 are undocumented COVID+ leading to missleading fatality rate. Moreover, as reported in the comments, to date, there are no univocal diagnostic methods wordwide.
However, Italy is experiencing a huge increment in daily cumulative deaths compered to China:

# Generating bar plot
library(ggplot2)
ggplot()+
  geom_bar(data=subset(dataset, location == ""China""), 
           aes(as.numeric(date), new_deaths, fill = ""China""),

  geom_bar(data=subset(dataset, location == ""Italy""), 
           aes(as.numeric(date), new_deaths, fill = ""Italy""), 
           stat = ""identity"", position = position_dodge(), alpha = .75)+

  labs(x=""Outbreak duration (days)"", y= ""Daily deaths (n)"", fill = ""Location"")+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = ""Set1"")+
  theme_light(14)




Something is happening there! Hubei province is almost similar to Italy in terms of surface and population but very different in terms of population mean age since Italy is one of the oldest EU country.
","Reason 1 something technical about the computation.

Dying occurs with some delay to getting sick. As a consequence the ratio of people that got sick and the people that have died, is not equal to the ratio of people that will die.

(Still, if the number of sick cases and death cases both grow exponentially with the same factor then you might still expect this number to remain constant, but keep in mind that the growth is not exponential and that it is only a simplified model)



Reason 2 something important about the data acquisition

You might say, ok then let's compare the number of death cases with the number of sick several days ago (according to the average number that it takes between getting sick and dying).

But, the most important reason why the death rate based on these statistics is not constant and not comparible is because those numbers are only the reported cases and those may be a lot less than the real cases. So you are not computing a real death rate.

The statistic (reported/confirmed cases) is not what you think that it is (number of cases). This is especially clear in the curve of cases for China which has a bump because the number of cases rapidly increased after the defenitions were changed (from positively tested people to people with clinical symptoms)
"
"Like a lot of amateurs, I would like to see how well the evolution of Covid-19 is predictable. So I imported the data (here, for Italy) and fitted a logistic curve. Then I added the 90% and 95% confidence bounds. I got the following plot:



Great. The next day, I updated my plot with the latest data and realized that the estimation was had been quite optimistic and the asymptote is now much increased (same scale in both pictures):



Questions I understand that if the logistic model had been good, the next point should have been in the confidence range with a probability of 90% (or 95%). Can I conclude that the logistic model is not a good model here? Are there some standard procedures to assess the validity of the prediction by taking into account the uncertainty on the model?

Also, the difference between the two asymptotes gives me an indication of the precision of the prediction (it is not off by 1 or by 10^5 but by about 500 deaths). Is there some classic methods to take this into account?

Edit 21/03/2020: clarification in response to hakan's answer

The model I fitted is 
$$\dfrac{c}{1 + a e^{-b x}}$$
and with $a=514434$, $b=-0.276$ and $c=5568$. Of course, this model is the same as @hakanc's, with a different parametrization (e.g. his $K$ corresponds to my $c$). The corresponding covariance matrix is
$$\begin{bmatrix} 1.1\times 10^{10}&amp; 641 &amp; -2.5\times 10^7 \\ \star &amp; 3.8\times 10^{-5} &amp; -1.6\\ \star &amp; \star &amp; 80\times 10^3 \end{bmatrix}$$

I believe the low sensitivity to $c$ ($=K$) is described by the $(3,3)$ component of the covariance matrix, $\sigma=\sqrt{80\times 10^3}\approx 280$. So though I understand (and agree with) the argument of low sensitivity, I believe it is already included in the ""confidence band"".
","When working with mathematical models, it is always good to check the assumptions of the model. The logistic function is often used when modelling population growth, and specifically where the rate of reproduction is proportional to both the existing population and the amount of available resources, all else being equal. Letting $P$ represent population size, the differential equation is 

$$
{\displaystyle {\frac {dP}{dt}}=rP\cdot \left(1-{\frac {P}{K}}\right),}
$$
where the constant $r$ defines the growth rate and $K$ is the carrying capacity, see the link for more details. The solution, letting $P_0$ be the initial population, is
$$
P(t)={\frac {KP_{0}e^{rt}}{K+P_{0}\left(e^{rt}-1\right)}}
$$
Thus, this model would be appropriate if Italy did nothing to mitigate the spread of the virus, but they are in fact using quarantine. The effect of wrong modelling assumptions would be that if you cross-validated the fitted model, you would get poor results. 

Additionally, since the shape of the logistic function is 



and in your data, it does not seem to include the part where the curve flattens out, I would suspect that the parameter describing that phenomenon, $K$, would have a high variance from your estimation procedure. An intuitive explanation for this can be done by plotting the function for different $K$ and constant $r$:



In this figure, if there is only data for $t$ between 0 and 1 would not reveal so much information on $K$, other than if $K$ is around 10, compared to $K &gt; 100$. More formally, assuming you are doing maximum likelihood estimation, you can look at the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the corresponding likelihood function, to see if optimization problem is well conditioned.

"In response to the spread of COVID-19 disease, all Californians were ordered on 19 March 2020 to stay at home, except for such necessary errands as trips to grocery stores, pharmacies, etc. On 21 March the San Francisco Chronicle reported that about $11\,500$ tests for the virus have been completed so far with $1206$ positive results among them. 

Can anything useful be said about the prevalence of the virus in California based on these results? If (a) the 11500 tests were from randomly chosen Californians and (b) the tests were of ""gold standard"" quality, then prevalence would be close to $1206/11500 =  0.1049 \approx 10.5\%.$

However, according to the Chronicle article, guidelines have centered on testing people showing symptoms of COVID-19 disease, care workers who have had contact with COVID-19 patients, and people who have symptoms of pneumonia, but test negative for pneumonia. Moreover, tests are ""coming from a growing list of private companies, private labs, and public and private universities,"" so there is no way to know proportions of false positives and false negatives for any one test, let alone the overall rates for whatever mix of tests accounts for the 11,500 reported results.

In my answer below, I will extend my answer to this question to give prevalence values resulting from various assumptions about the sensitivity and specificity of the tests involved. I use the notation of that page. This analysis may help to answer the question for whatever population produced the specimens tested.

Additional answers are welcome, perhaps showing alternative methods or based on
additional information that may become available as the pandemic
continues
","Notation. Let $\pi = P(\text{Disease})$ be the prevalence of the disease in the population and $\tau = P(\text{Pos Test})$ be the proportion testing positive. For the test, let
$\eta = P(\text{Pos}|\text{Disease})$ be the sensitivity and
$\theta = P(\text{Neg}|\text{No Disease})$ be its specificity. Also, given test results, let 
$\gamma =  P(\text{Disease}| \text{Pos})$ and 
$\delta =  P(\text{No Disease}| \text{Neg})$ be, respectively, the predictive powers of a positive or negative test.

If a test is of gold standard quality with $\eta = \theta = 1,$ then $\pi = \tau.$ Tests that accurately sequence the genome of the virus may be gold standard tests. Often the first tests for a virus may have considerably lower values of $\eta$ and $\theta.$ It is difficult to find accounts of values of $\eta$ and $\theta$ for any of the tests in current use for COVID-19. (According to one unauthorized report, a test used in China had $\theta \approx 0.7.)$

Traditional estimate. First, we look at results for tests with $\eta = \theta = 0.95.$ Then for data with $n= 11\,500; a = 1206,$ we have $\hat \tau = t = 0.1049.$ The associated 95% Wald confidence interval for $\tau$ is $(0.0993, 0.1105)$
from which one can derive the confidence interval
$(0.0547, 0.0672)$ for $\pi.$ Also, $\pi = 0.061$ implies that the predictive power of a positive test is $\gamma = 0.5523.$ Only about half of the subjects testing positive are actually infected.
Some computations in R follow:

ETA = THETA = .95
n = 11500;  a = 1206;  p0m = -1:1; t = a/n
wald.TAU = t +p0m*1.96*sqrt(t*(1-t)/n);  wald.TAU
[1] 0.09926973 0.10486957 0.11046940
ci.PI = (wald.T + THETA - 1)/(ETA + THETA - 1);  ci.PI

PI = (t + THETA -1)/(ETA + THETA -1); PI
[1] 0.06096618
GAMMA = PI*ETA/(PI*ETA + (1-PI)*(1-THETA)); GAMMA
[1] 0.5522849


When the traditional estimate is problematic. For a poorer test with $\eta = \theta = 0.90,$ this method gives a CI for $\pi$ 
as $(-0.0009, 0.0131),$ which has a (nonsensical) negative left endpoint. (We would expect about 1150 false positive tests even with no infected subjects. This is getting close to the the observed number 1206 of positive tests.) In such circumstances, one wonders whether to trust the point estimates $\hat \pi = 0.0061$ and $\hat \gamma = 0.0522.$

ETA = THETA = .9
n = 11500;  a = 1206;  p0m = -1:1; t = a/n
wald.TAU = t +p0m*1.96*sqrt(t*(1-t)/n);  wald.TAU
[1] 0.09926973 0.10486957 0.11046940

PI = (t + THETA -1)/(ETA + THETA -1); PI
[1] 0.006086957
GAMMA = PI*ETA/(PI*ETA + (1-PI)*(1-THETA)); GAMMA
[1] 0.05223881


A Gibbs sampler. One useful alternative approach is to assume a beta prior distribution on prevalence $\pi \sim \mathsf{Beta(\alpha, \beta)}.$ Even if noninformative with $\alpha = \beta = 0.5,$ such a prior distribution excludes value of $\pi$ outside $(0,1).$
Then we use a Gibbs sampler to find the posterior distribution of $\pi,$ given our data $n = 11\,500, a = 1206.$ Its steps, within each iteration, are as follows:


We begin with an arbitrary value of $\pi_1 \in (0,1)$ and use it to estimate 'latent' counts of subjects with the disease based on predictive values $\gamma$ and $\delta.$ We sample counts $X \sim \mathsf{Binom}(a, \gamma)$ and $Y \sim \mathsf{Binom}(n-A, 1 - \delta).$
Then with the estimated $S = X+Y$ infected subjects, we update the beta prior at this step as $\pi|S \sim \mathsf{BETA}(\alpha + S, \beta + n - S).$ Finally, we sample $\pi_2$ from this updated distribution. Even with arbitrary $\pi_1,$ this new value $\pi_2$ is likely to be closer to the truth.


Simulated posterior distribution. Iterating through many such steps we get successive values $\pi_1, \pi_2, \pi_3, \dots ,$
in a convergent Markov chain, for which the limiting distribution is the desired posterior distribution of the prevalence. To make sure that the chain has reached steady state, we
use only the last half of the many values $\pi_i$ generated in this way. 

Cutting 2.5% of the probability from each tail of the simulated posterior distribution, we can obtain a 95% Bayesian probability estimate for prevalence $\pi.$

Because the two-sided Bayesian probability interval $(.00003, .0123)$ has its lower endpoint so near to 0, we also look at the one-sided interval $(0, .0110)$ for $\pi.$  

Because we estimate the predictive power $\gamma$ of a positive test at each step of the chain, we capture its values in order to get a 95\% Bayesian probability interval $(0.0003, 0.1005)$ for the predictive power $\gamma$ of a positive test. If we were to sequester subjects that get a positive result with this test, then only a relatively small proportion of sequestered subjects would actually be infected.

Diagnostic Plots. Not all Gibbs samplers converge as
anticipated. Diagnostic plots show that this one does. 


A plot of successive values of $\pi$ shows the nature of the convergence of the Markov chain. The history plot of $\pi$ shows that the chain 'mixes well'; that is, it moves freely among appropriate values. There are no points of
near-absorption. 
The trace of running averages of the $\pi_i$ shows smooth convergence to prevalence 0.0049.
Vertical blue lines indicate the burn-in period.
The ACF plot shows that the $\pi_i$ are not independent. Among the $m = 100\,000$ values, perhaps there are 1000
independent ones. In many Gibbs samplers, Markov dependence 'wears away' more rapidly than here. 
The plot at lower-right is a history plot of the $\gamma_i.$ 




Variations. If we run the same program with $\eta = \theta = .95,$ results are nearly the same as for the traditional procedure. If we have useful prior information (or opinions) about the prevalence, we can incorporate that information into the prior distribution on $\pi.$

"Everywhere in the news we hear about numbers of corona-virus infections, deaths and recoveries.

In lots of the publications the numbers (especially the infections) are compared with previous days. Mostly the presented numbers are 'growth' of new infections in per cent and the total number of infections so far. Then the numbers of different countries are shown. 

I tried to get something out of these numbers (of infections) and realized that some important information is not told: the amount of tests done. And even further, who is tested? Which criteria? And this varies a lot between countries. Then there is the accuracy of tests. 

The number and kind of tests done everyday change as well as more capacity is created or less capacity is available due to overloads or work restrictions.

I told myself the amount of deaths, as horrible as it sounds, is a good indicator of stabilization or regression. But no, people are not effected the same way regarding their previous medical condition. At some point in time, people at risk will ""disappear"" (again sorry for the word-choice).

I have the feeling that there so many variables and factors we are not able to gather regarding this pandemic (at least currently) that statistics are at their limit. Announced trends are most likely wrong. 

How sure can we be about statistics in the current situation? Are trends viable? What can be compared what not? Is all current information foundationless?
","Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good

Many of the issues you have raised are perfectly reasonable concerns.  Having said that, it is important to distinguish between cases where reported data is wrong, versus cases where reported data is correct, but is limited in its usage due to the omission of other relevant information.  The latter case is really quite ubiquitous in statistical analysis, since it is very rare that we have all the data we would ideally like to have.  In such circumstances, it is also important not to make the perfect the enemy of the good by presuming that the absence of a comprehensive dataset on every variable we would like to know about precludes any reasonable inferences being made from the data we have.

The main comprehensive public dataset we have available for the COVID-19 virus is the data held and updated by the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre at John Hopkins University.  This is the repository of data that is being used for the vast majority of media reports and data visualisations on the spread of COVID-19.  The database has data on confirmed infections, recoveries, and deaths, plus GIS data on where these occurred.  The data is sourced from the WHO and various national health departments, and it is being updated frequently.

It is certainly true that there are a lot of other things we would ideally like to have data about, to assist in understanding the path and severity of the virus.  As you have suggested, it would be wonderful if we could also obtaina comprehensive dataset on all the tests that have actually been conducted (including the negative results), and the characteristics of all the affected patients, including their age, sex, and health factors.   At this early stage it is probably overly ambitious to expect all of this data to have been collected and collated, but hopefully the various health departments of the world will eventually be able to bring some of this data together.  Health departments cannot legally disclose health information on particular patients in a way that would make them identifiable, so it is an extremely complex task to collate this type of data if the goal is to make it available for public analysis.  No doubt there will be some efforts to obtain and collate more detailed data, but it will be a difficult task.

When interpreting limited data, it is desirable to describe that data in a way that makes it clear how it was collected, and this collection mechanism forms a caveat on analysis.  Thus, we can refer to the reported numbers of infections, recoveries, deaths, etc., from each of the reporting countries, while noting that there may be disparities from these figures to the actual true numbers.  Most health departments around the world are set up so that they can obtain these figures with reasonable accuracy, so that large diparities between reported figures and the true values are unlikely, except in the case of countries that make a deliberate effort to suppress this information.  Notwithstanding the lack of the ideal data you would like, from the reported data there are certainly some things that we can reasonably infer.  For most countries, the data is likely to be a reasonably representation of the number of infected, recovered, and dead patients out of those who have been properly tested.  (Of course, I take some of the data, such as the recent numbers from China, with a large degree of scepticism.)  It is also likely that there are other infected and recovered people who have not been tested, and who therefore do not form part of the reported statistics.  Even so, this data gives us a pretty good look at growth rates for the infection in various cities and countries around the world, which allows us to see where the virus has progresssed most rapidly, and where it has been relatively contained.  These numbers also allow some attempt at extrapolation, which allows health authorities to make predictions on the likely number of cases at future dates, and the health burden this will create in different places.

Your question appears to assert that most of these trends are likely to be ""wrong"" due to the absence of data on other factors such as total testing and patient health.  In my view, that is not the correct way to look at it.  Rather, the reported trends may be correct, in the limited descriptive sense, but there may still be underlying non-reported factors that would give reason to anticipate future changes in those trends.  Personally, I am extremely impressed at how rapidly these various organisations have coordinated a large data collation and made public online platforms reporting on the infection and updating it frequently.  I can log on every day and see updated graphical information showing the progression of the infection in virtually any city or country in the world!  The data may not be perfect, but I would think it would bear enough of a resemblance to reality to be valuable information.  I think the effort is quite amazing, and it far past what we could do even ten years ago.

"I first learned the logistic function in machine learning course, where it is just a function that map a real number to 0 to 1. We can use calculus to get its derivative and use the derivative for some optimization tasks.

Later, I learned it in statistic literature where there are log odds and bunch of probabilistic interpretations. 

Today I am reviewing some differential equation literature, and found the logistic function is a solution for the following system:

$y'=y(1-y)$, and $y(0)=0.5$.



So, my question is more like a ""chicken and egg"" problem: where does the logistic function come from? Do we first have the function or the ODE?
","I read from Strogatz's book that it was originated from modeling the human populations by Verhulst in 1838. Assume the population size is $N(t)$, then the per capita growth rate is $\dot N(t)/N(t)$. By assuming the per capita growth rate descreases linearly with the population size, we can have the logistic equation of following form:
$$\dot N(t)=rN(1-\frac{N}{K}),$$
where $K$ is carrying capacity of the environment. From the equation, we can see that when $N$ is very small, the population grows approximately exponentially. As $N$ grows until half of the capacity, the derivative $\dot N$ is still increasing but slows down. Once $N$ passes the half line, the derivative decreases so we can see a bending curve (we can see this actually from Coronavirus cases) and the population asymptotically approaches the capacity. Up to this point, we observe the properties of a logistic function. Intuitively, when $N$ is larger the capacity, the population decreases. By further mathematical simplification of the equation, we have an equation like this:
$$\frac{df(x)}{dx}=f(x)(1-f(x)),$$
which has analytical solotion as:
$$f(x)=\frac{e^x}{e^x + C}.$$
With $C=1$ we have the logistic function.

"Dr. Raoult, who promotes Hydroxychloroquine, has some really intriguing statement about statistics in the biomedical field:


  It's counterintuitive, but the smaller the sample size of a clinical test, the more significant its results are. The differences in a sample of 20 people may be more significant than in a sample of 10,000 people. If we need such a sample, there is a risk of being wrong. With 10,000 people, when the differences are small, sometimes they don't exist. 


Is this a false statement in statistics? If so, is it therefore also false in the Biomedical field? On which basis can we refute it properly, by a confidence interval?

Dr. Raoult promotes Hydroxychloroquine as a cure for Covid-19, thanks to an article about a study on 24 patients. His claims have been repeated a lot because of for this study, but mainly in the mainstream media, not in the scientific press.

In machine learning, the SciKit workflow states that before choosing any model, you NEED a dataset with at least 50 samples, whether it be for a simple regression, or the most advance clustering technique, etc., which is why I find this statement really intriguing.



EDIT: some of the answers below make the assumption of no result bias. They deal with the concept of power and effect size.
However it seems there is a bias in Dr. Raoult data. The most striking being removing data for the dead, for the reason they could not provide data for the entire duration of the study.  

My question remains however focused on the impact of using a small sample size.


Source of the statement about Statistics in a French magazine
Reference to the scientific paper in question.

","I agree with many of the other answers here but think the statement is even worse than they make it out to be. 

The statement is an explicit version of an implicit claim in many shoddy analyses of small datasets. These hint that because they have found a significant result in a small sample, their claimed result must be real and important because it is 'harder' to find a significant effect in a small sample. This belief is simply wrong, because random error in small samples means that any result is less trustworthy, whether the effect size is large or small. Large and significant effects are therefore more likely to be of the incorrect magnitude and more importantly, they can be in the wrong direction. Andrew Gelman refers to these usefully as 'Type S' errors (estimates whose sign is wrong) as opposed to 'Type M' errors (estimates whose magnitude is wrong). Combine this with the file-drawer effect (small, non-significant results go unpublished, while large, significant ones are published) and you are most of the way to the replication crisis and a lot of wasted time, effort and money. 

Thanks to @Adrian below for digging up a figure from Gelman that illustrates this point well: 



This may seem to be an extreme example but the point is entirely relevant to the argument made by Raoult.

"Authors and readers can discuss about the writing of authors including ideas, experience design, hypothesis etc., like what people discuss at stackoverflow, rather than authors only get feedbacks until publishing the paper after all work done.

I am wondering if there is any website for researchers around the world to discuss about their research.  (Thanks for Buffy.)

I know researchgate but it seems not for the purpose. 

Thank you.
","In the 20th century newsgroups like, e.g., 

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sci.physics

were perfect for this, they still exist and you can narrow down the scope and audience of such a group by creating one on your own. Nowadays probably more scientists in such a field post and read on bulletin boards like

https://www.physicsforums.com/

or 

https://physics.stackexchange.com.

But, professional scientists don't have much time for long discussions. I think this is also the reason the Q&amp;A format attracts much more then bulletin boards or formerly newsgroups. Academia is about asking the right questions, if you have the question, you have to work on it based on scientific rigor and methodology. There is not so much to discuss publicly before or during doing this work or writing papers and hypothesis. Science is about coming up with a way to solve or answer a question and comparing/commenting on that. The aftermath, discussions come afterwards, when work and answers have been published. So my experience is with disccusion formats you attract in best case undergraduates and early PhD students still learning. Professional scientists mostly have private or public discussions on conferences. 

So the best option you might have to discuss with experts on your topics online are virtual conferences where maybe a chat or comment app is attached to each talk. I'm wondering myself how easy and cheap web-technology has become here as I'm now registered for a big conference in my field which will not be canceled with respect to corona virus due to organization cost but many presentations will be shown online after remote registration.

Researchgate I think also can work for this if you have enough followers reading your posted questions. Online, the question is always how do you advertise your post to readers and commenters you are looking for.

"I am an organizer for a graduate student conference in Mathematics occurring in April. My co-organizers and I are debating on a plan for what to do if the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States worsens. Right now, most of the participants are from states with no confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but this may change rapidly as the situation develops between now and the conference.

This is an issue other conferences throughout history have surely had to deal with, so I wanted to ask StackExchange if there were any best practices around for dealing with an issue like this. Some questions:


How far out should the go/no go decision be made? If the conference is late April, should we be planning to let participants and speakers know by early April so they can cancel flights and so on?
What criteria should best inform whether we cancel or not? Number of cases in the participants' states for instance?
In the event we are to cancel the conference, how can we still give the speakers a chance to advertise their results? Have there been successful ""video conferences"" before where the organizers collect video for each talk and then upload them and participants can make comments? 

","Regarding remote conferences, these have been successful. Often the motivating factor has been mitigating climate impact. For example, Yale Climate Connections wrote an article giving advice for running virtual conferences. Author Sara Peach presents three kinds of virtual conferencing, all of which have been done successfully: 


remote presentations in a traditional conference format. If people choose to not travel, they can still remote in or follow the session on social media. (Example: AGU)
hub-based conference, where people gather in regional clusters. Each hub has some of its own content but are able to watch each other's presentations. (Example: International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition)
an entirely remote conference, where people record and upload videos of presentations and conferencegoers have weeks to ask questions and interact. (Example: A Nearly Carbon-Neutral Conference Model)


I'll add that an entirely virtual synchronous conference has also been done successfully. One example is NACADA, the Global Community for Academic Advising, which ran a 24-hour live-streaming virtual conference. 

The mixed-conference or hub models may or may not be feasible, since they would still involve people gathering in some models, and you aren't sure yet whether that will be feasible on any scale. Also, developing regional hubs would take time you don't have.  Thus, if you decide to go entirely virtual, a synchronous-with-live-streaming conference and a asynchronous recorded approach have been done, and the resources linked should provide a way to start researching or planning that model. I also advise contacting your own IT department about the possibility.

"Given the recent shutdowns of many universities across the world, there's an increased interest in online education techniques.

In my case, I am a TA for a quantum chemistry class, and I'm finding it daunting to transition to online teaching. At first, I got really excited because I thought of taking advantage of this situation to run a flipped discussion section: I'd record lectures in advance, and then have virtual office hours where students could Zoom/Skype/Google hangout with me and we discuss in the same chatroom (so everyone hears the conversation). 

However, in what I suspect to be an attempt to distance themselves from something nice and free/far cheaper (like edX) which has been doing this online routine for a long time, my university has required that we livestream our lectures/discussion sections. This is purportedly to be in the aim to make their online experience as college-like as possible, but it's problematic for multiple reasons. First, lectures are at 9AM EST... Do we expect students to tune in at 10 PM in Japan? Or 3 AM in Hawaii? 

Second, we should use the silver linings present in this university shutdown: video lectures = students get to go back and re-listen to a part that confused them! From my perspective, this university requirement goes against an attempt to maintain normalcy: normalcy should not be defined as continuation of the same daily routine (impossible for many), but rather a continuation of helpful instruction.

I intend to find out whom to email about this, but in the meantime, what resources/advice would you suggest for an instructor who suddenly has to transition to the digital classroom?
","This is marked for community ownership so constructive edits will be welcomed. It is, however, more directed at those who can design a course, rather than a TA who has limited control. 

Background

Many of the teaching techniques we use are not optimal for learning. They have been designed for economic efficiency since they scale. Some of them have been a bit obsolete since the creation of the internet. But face to face classes in real time are no longer necessary. Lecture is efficient (one teacher, many students, synchronous), but again, not optimal. Testing is a poor way to guarantee competence. This current emergency can be considered to be an opportunity to rethink everything we do toward finding better ways to educate people. We are forced to act and the old ways don't work in a new environment. We should be looking for new ways. 

The essentials of teaching are Delivery, Practice, Feedback, Assessment. All of these require Two Way Communication. They don't require synchronicity or exams. The first job is to teach people, not to grade them. If you get that part backwards then you are only ""teaching"" people who don't need to be taught. 

Every student is different. Nearly every student learns differently from the way their instructor does. The instructor has been proven to stand out in a particular system in which others have failed. As an instructor you have an obligation to every student willing to put in the effort, not just to the ones naturally predisposed to ""win"" in some system. Not every student starts at the same place with the same understandings. The same words don't necessarily have the same meanings to different people. 

Some people have handicaps that prevent certain kinds of interactions. Hearing impairment and vision impairment are obvious ones, but there are others. 

Learning is individual, but the process need not require isolation. It can be a communal process with learners helping each other. Denying students the option of working together is sub-optimal. A course can be a communal activity, not a hierarchical one. 

Some students will succeed no matter the system. They don't really need you for anything more than pointing to important sources/ideas. But most actually require your assistance since insight into a topic can be hard to come by. Many students actually need to be taught how to learn. If you change the system of learning they may need to be retaught how to internalize ideas and turn them into competencies. It isn't automatic or obvious. 

Learning isn't ""consuming"" material. It requires active participation. It requires a change in the brain (The Art of Changing the Brain by James E Zull)

All of these things have long been taken into account in designing educational systems, but the current practice is a compromise that values economic (scale) values over educational ones. Not everywhere, of course, but the exceptions seem few to me. 

Let's assume that everything is on the table, except that students and instructors can no longer meet face to face in groups. Meetings of any kind need to be small and optional with alternatives provided. Computer communication of some kind is needed, but costs are an issue as is the privacy of all participants. 

What to do, what to do. 

Ideas for Delivery

There are a lot of ways for students to have access to the material of a course. Books are traditional. Lecture has replaced most other methods. But lectures are longer than they need to be. Some research I read suggests that lectures of 10 to 15 minutes are more efficient than hour or longer lectures (https://spokenimpact.com/what-is-the-ideal-length-for-a-presentation/). Those contemplating video should take note of that. Video also needs to be accompanied with a transcript to aid those with impairments. 

Moreover, students need to be able to review material. Video is difficult in this regard since it is hard to quickly return to a small part that needs review without watching longer sections, which leads to boredom. Transcripts can mark the time that important ideas are introduced. 

There is a fine line between having good and poor production values in video. If they are too good, a video talk becomes just entertainment with poor learning, unless other means are used to encourage/enforce engagement. If they are too bad, then students will get lost and frustrated. Video professionals are good at this sort of thing, but it is hard to bootstrap immediately at scale.

Delivery alone is just media. Students need to incorporate what they see in a lecture, long or short, into their long term memory and into their effective competencies. More is involved than the eyes and ears. Students often think that the will automatically ""learn"" what is presented to them in a lecture, talk, demonstration, etc. but it is anything but automatic. 

Caveats: Any ""solution"" that requires real-time synchronous presence on the internet will probably fail. And it will fail invisibly for some. Connections are dropped, servers overload, etc. It is hard enough to keep students off their phone when in a class. It is probably impossible to do in a real-time internet lecture. Other distractions will intrude. Moreover, unless you have an exceptional communication system, students won't be able to interrupt you when you make a mistake, as you will. No questions are likely to be asked in real time. It is also difficult for a presenter to give a lively talk with no audience feedback at all. Especially if you are trying to do this under emergency conditions without training and experience.  

But if you absolutely must use synchronous delivery you need to do two additional things. The first is that you need to record and post your lectures so that those who must miss the original don't lose access. 

The second, just as vital, is that you provide a real time feedback to yourself (or to an assistant sitting by your side) so that questions can be asked as you lecture and so that students have a way to mention/note errors you make. 

And make sure that students know what to do in the case that you lose the server and the ability to broadcast. Avoid chaos and uncertainty as much as possible. 

Ideas for Practice

Student practice exercises and tasks may not need to change much. Students, depending on the field, need to write, solve problems, and other things as appropriate. For the most part this can probably proceed largely unchanged. Instructors have access to many such student exercises. If the students have a text book they probably have a bank of suitable exercises and questions. 

And note that practice and reinforcement is probably the most important element in a delivered education. The ""content"" that a student needs is, for the most part, available to them. There are exceptions for very advanced work, but the world's knowledge is pretty much available. Instructors help students choose the important things and avoid the garbage, of course, but it is up to the students themselves to learn by reinforcement (combined with feedback). Whatever the topic, competence comes from repetition and reinforcement. The only thing I teach nowadays is Tai Chi. We have a saying that you need to repeat a movement ten thousand times to learn it. Somewhere in those ten thousand tries, insight will start to develop. The same is true in things like mathematics and writing poetry. 

So, remember that the things that you make the students do to learn are much more important than the things you say. Good course design focuses on the student tasks, not the lectures. 

I caution, however, that copyright considerations may apply if an instructor tries to utilize exercises from copyrighted material. They are, in a sense, publishing things they send to students in an online course. Caution and legal advice is useful. 

Ideas for Feedback

Feedback is two way. You need feedback from the students on your presentations and assignments. Students need feedback on their own work. A number or letter grade on a paper isn't feedback. It gives no basis for understanding how to improve. 

If the materials presented are well vetted, such as textbooks, the need for feedback to the instructor is a bit lessened. But videos, especially those prepared in the moment are likely to contain errors. Shorter videos are easier to fix than longer ones. But, unlike face to face classes, the instructor isn't likely to be interrupted when there is a misstatement or an omission. Moreover, you need some indication that the students have actually understood what you have been saying and presenting. Again, in fact to face classes you can look at expressions on their faces for some important feedback. 

Lets assume for the moment that you have already taught your students the importance of taking notes during presentations. At the end of a lecture you can ask individual students, perhaps volunteers, to tell you an important idea from the talk. You can do this two or three times and give them feedback on their replies. This can be transferred to online learning. If readings or video presentations are short (and, I assume asynchronous) you can ask students to send you a summary of the lesson. Restrict them to one or two sentences. Another possible request is to ask them to send you a possible exam question on that material. At some point, all student replies, perhaps anonymized, can be made available to everyone. By glancing through the replies you learn whether they are getting the main points and they are also getting the reinforcement they need. 

Giving feedback to students on their work is critical to learning. This involves answering questions that they have, but also showing them where they are making mistakes, and why, in their own work. The previous section talked about repetition and reinforcement. It is possible for students to learn and reinforce the wrong message. If you get an incorrect idea deeply ingrained in your mind it can be difficult to dislodge. All student work needs to be commented on, not just graded. Publishing solutions to exercises after the fact can help, but it isn't the same thing. 

This idea of individual feedback is one of the most difficult things to arrange in the modern educational system, simply because of scale. My university teaching (and student life) mostly involved classes of fewer than 30 students. At that scale, I could easily give good individual feedback on weekly assignments. At 40 students I found I needed help. Massive courses have a problem here that requires tools - probably better tools than are now available. I'll note that Harvard's CS50 course is delivered to about 800 students at a time. But the staff for the course is about 40 individuals, so the ratio is about 20:1. Some of the staff are graders who comment on student work. Others are TAs who hold individual ""recitation"" sections of 20-30 students so that questions can be answered and misconceptions dispelled. I worry that moving such recitation online might not work as well at scale unless there are communication tools that let people learn from the questions of others. Many students are reluctant to ask questions. The brave students willing to do so actually contribute to the education of their peers. But, answering a question for a single student, say in an office, is much less productive than answering it in public, so that all can share the response. Tools are needed for this, though they can be pretty simple. University managed email lists subscribed to by students and staff are pretty effective. 

But if students produce ""papers"" of any kind, those need to be annotated and returned. More than a numeric or letter grade is needed. Something as simple as pointing a student to a place they need to review is helpful. But the goal is to foster insight. PDF files can be annotated and returned, but the process is awkward at best. And, again, there is the scale problem. It takes time to review and time to annotate. Then, the student will likely have questions that need to be addressed based on the annotations. The increase in awkwardness using current tools may require more staffing to make things work effectively. Even a simple email to a student takes more time than jotting a comment on a paper and then returning it at the next face session. 

Ideas for Assessment

In my view, evaluation and assessment are the most difficult issues we face in moving to an internet model. However, they also, again in my view, have the most potential for long term improvements in student learning, provided that we take the opportunity to learn how to do a better job of it. 

The first principle of assessment ought to be that any sort of evaluation have an actual educational purpose, not just a ""sorting"" purpose. I think that many of us aren't doing a stellar job of this, having opted for easy solutions that scale, rather than solutions that aid student learning. Multiple choice tests are overused and while it is possible to design good ones, it is devilishly difficult. Things that rely on machine grading in general are too likely to also rely on only shallow learning and memorization, rather than deep learning and mastery. If the students can be held in a room and closely monitored this sort of thing tells you something about them, but it can likely be better. Move them outside your purview and it becomes nearly impossible. And it even fails at scale. 

While you can do some technological things to lock up a student's personal computer they are intrusive but also ineffective. You can enlist a vast army of TAs to monitor student webcams (intrusive, again) but even there, what happens slightly off screen is invisible. Without such intrusive measures students have access to helpers both human and electronic. Closed-book, closed notes exams are probably a mistake in any case, but online they are difficult to impossible to monitor. There are too many inducements for students to break the rules to really assure validity. Honor codes, such as those of Dartmouth College do have a positive effect, but part of that effect is that the codes have been in place for half a century. 

I have some personal suggestions about alternatives to examinations and, especially, high stakes examinations such as finals that account for a large fraction of a students grade. I don't claim these are the only solutions, but am more interested in sparking thoughts about how we can do a better - more learning focused - job of evaluation and assessment. I implemented these more and more as my career progressed and I learned more about students and about learning. 

The first idea is to reduce the overall effect of any given exam or test. If you have forty small items you can get at least as good a picture of a student's progress as if you have only one or two large ones. Moreover, high stakes testing too often leads to poor student studying habits, such as cramming for exams and cheating. 

One technique I used toward the end was ""cumulative grading"". A course had 1000 points assigned to it and different student activities were ""worth"" a certain amount of points. A project might be 100 points. The result was evaluated (and commented on) and a certain number of points was awarded, perhaps 80. I also published the minimum number of points necessary for each letter grade, say 800 for a B. When a student accumulates enough points to ""earn"" the grade they desire they no longer need to do more. There was no risk. Another feature of it was that if the student wasn't satisfied with the points earned they could re-do the work and possibly earn additional points. Some limits were put in place, but they were generous. The philosophy behind it is ""You aren't in this course to prove to me that you don't need to be here."" But note that I could do this since the ratio of staff to students was good. This is hard to scale without help. 

The second main technique I used and can recommend is to make almost all assessment and evaluation based on student writings and projects, not examinations. And, if the nature of the course permits, use group projects primarily. For my courses the group size was usually between two and five. These groups can meet in cyberspace or, if location and other factors permit, they can meet face to face. The projects might be large or small. They can be graded once or often. Points can accumulate. It is the project that is graded, not the individuals, so everyone earns the same grade unless that is impossible. Peer evaluation is used to award bonus points or to solve issues of non-participation, etc. 

If there are a number of group projects students can move between groups if needed. But students also need to be taught how to run an effective group project. In the courses I taught, dividing up the work ""equally"" was always discouraged and if done, usually leads to poor outcomes. Students need to form teams, not just amalgamations of individuals. In CS this skill will be valued later in their careers. 

Also, peer evaluation has to be properly managed. Students don't ""grade"" one another. They comment on the contributions of a few or all of their team mates. ""Who was the most helpful team member? (or three top members) Why? What did they contribute? What was your own chief contribution?"" 

At a certain scale or with sufficient help you can easily determine who falls into which important grading groups. Who is excellent in all respects? Who shows promise? Who is getting by? Who is deficient? Who has failed? Elaborate point systems in which an 85 is somehow significantly different from an 87 have little real meaning in my opinion. 

To emphasize a point above. In many fields, even very technical ones, writing is an important skill. Writing essays on a given topic is good professional preparation for a budding mathematician. Exams can be replaced with such essays, lessening the needs for security and such. They seem to me to be much more value long term than skill at exams. But you can probably expect that students will hate it initially. 

The above, of course, are just ideas. But I found them to be more aligned with the teaching mission than the more traditional lecture and test. 

Ideas for Communication

To handle all of the above with online courses the main need is for effective communication between faculty and students and, I found, between students themselves. One goal is that what any student sees can be seen by any other student. 

Communication tools need not be complex or comprehensive. But they should permit asynchronous communication and should permit many-way communication. Threaded email lists are very useful and don't require extensive facilities. They can be private lists, managed by the university alleviating some privacy issues, open to only class members and staff. Documents can be distributed. Questions can be asked. Questions can be answered at any time of the day or night - even by other students. Someone needs to monitor these to make sure that misinformation is quickly corrected and that any rules about posting or not posting certain content are maintained. 

If project groups are long lived, then each group can have its own mailing list and can also use other tools they find for communication. 

Another useful tool is a group chatroom. Group chats can be held periodically, though the email lists were more useful for discussing course material. These are necessarily synchronous and so not every student might be able to ""attend"". But it is easy to capture the complete conversation as a text file and send it to everyone or post it on a course web site. 



My own expertise in this comes from helping to design and deliver a graduate program in which students met face to face only once a month for half a day per course. All work was done in groups (of about 5). Face time was only used for things that could not be done on line. We used simple tools for communication. All student-professor communication (other than personal things) was open to all students. Students could ask questions at any time and other students were encouraged to answer from their own expertise. The course was always live, every hour, every day. Questions got answered quickly, if not always perfectly. Students didn't get stuck. The goal was to build a learning community. That community has persisted past graduation. 



Minor updates only anticipated.

"In light of the recent pandemic of COVID-19 spreading in the world, there have been many Chinese papers with only English abstracts published in Chinese journals. Some western papers have cited the Chinese papers, but only based on the abstract as the author would say they do not understand the Chinese full text. 

I am a graduate student in the medical field with a good grasp of Chinese and English. Can I translate without permission, or offer to translate, these papers and publish in an indexed English journal/source? If I make the offer, what is the appropriate etiquette and considerations? 
","At the scale of one person, you could do the following. If you find a paper that you think merits translation, contact the authors and offer your services directly to them. They might not be able to help much if their research is ongoing, but would, I think, respond positively. You could also suggest appropriate English language journals to them that might publish the translations. I can't predict how that would work, but archives might be appropriate. 

I think that a lot of researchers in China (as everywhere) have a working knowledge of English and so could probably vet any translations you do for accuracy. 

As for the etiquette, just ask, introducing yourself. Or even send along a sample translation of a part of a paper as a calling card. 

I don't think that copyright can be ignored unless governments intervene to change the rules. It might happen due to the seriousness of the issue. 

But being in contact with researchers who have been with this since the beginning might actually be an advantage to your career also.

"How do you think next year's PhD applications would be affected by the COVID-19? Will we be seeing less numbers or more? Will they be more competitive?

Edit: mainly asking for applicants to the US and UK.
","It is hard to be certain about the future.


There will be more positions because of government stimulus spending.
More students will apply for PhD programs because they cannot find jobs.
As a result of chaos, fewer students will complete the eligibility requirements.


The most likely net effect is more applicants for more positions, but they will be less prepared.

"There has been a lot of talk about online teaching in relation to covid-19 and campus shutdowns.

This question isn't about that though: my question is about what ways online examinations should be treated in counterpoint to written examinations. 

I'm going to be transferring my course's written examination into an online environment. This examination involved 2 hours of students, with a pen and paper, answering questions both short and long in a typical examination environemnt.

An online exam however cannot be policed. Demanding it be anything other than open book is unrealistic. What methods can be deployed such that it is a genuine test of students' knowledge and capabilities?
","First, a two hour time limit might be difficult to enforce or to guarantee, especially if it uses a real-time clock. At some level of scale you may start to find that some students didn't get the exam paper or were unable to return it by the deadline. So, I'd start by rethinking if a time limit of less than a day is really essential to your exam. 

Second, you can pre-vet any questions you ask by doing searching yourself online for possible answers and responses. Reject questions that have too much online presence, or be prepared for getting that back as answers. Presumably the test isn't about effective online searches. 

Third, give up the idea of asking students for facts. That is obvious, I'd think, as facts are cheap. But even facts requiring computation, such as in mathematics or statistics can be generated with tools such as MatLab or Mathematica. 

The best sort of questions, I think, are those that require either or both of interpretation and insight. Questions about the why of things rather than the what and how are much better. However, these are the hardest to create, the hardest to answer, and are likely to have the widest variation in quality from students. To grade them might require quite a lot of interpretation: does this student show any insight at all into the subject? Pass-fail grading can be considered. Repeat attempts can be considered. 

As an alternative to an exam, you can consider individual portfolio development by students. Students write or otherwise create some artifacts according to some criteria. Plagiarism concerns come in to play here, of course. 

I'll note that honor codes can help to a certain extent, though provide no guarantees. And honor codes created in the moment are probably less effective than those of long standing.

"I'm wondering how much Covid-19 affected scientific productivity, if it affected productivity negatively at all (c.f. Newton actually did a lot of his most important work while the University of Cambridge was closed due to plague).

I'm using the rate at which papers are published on arXiv as a proxy for ""scientific productivity"", fully aware that it is not a perfect proxy and probably lags actual productivity by quite a bit. If country-specific statistics are available, e.g. ""The number of publications by authors from Italy changed by __% on 9 March 2020, the date the lockdown started"", that's even better.
","ArXiv posts its monthly submission statistics here. It's noisy data even in the absence of viruses, so I can't tell if there's an effect yet or not. Then again, I'm no statistician. Extrapolating the March data as of today (March 19th), it's at least set to be larger than the February number of submissions, as is typical for March submissions.

However, even if the number of monthly arXiv submissions is to be considered a good proxy, it will likely lag by more time than we have seen so far. Yes, closures, adapting to online classes, and changed schedules will delay new experiments and other activities. However, finishing writing up manuscripts already in the pipeline, or analyzing already collected data are still productive tasks that will lead to new submissions for quite a while. Not to mention people such as myself, who can continue our theoretical/numerical work from home.

"It looks like I may completely write a paper while in coronavirus-related quarantine.  Would it be appropriate to thank my local government in the acknowledgements?  If I'm honest with myself, I don't think I would have been able to do this with such focus and efficiency if all other aspects of my life hadn't been suddenly shut down.

People often acknowledge visits to other institutions, which seem to serve a similar purpose, hence why I pose the question seriously.

Edit: I'm also in an at-risk group, and the government-mandated quarantine is kind of saving my life, so there's also that.
","I decided to elevate my comment to an answer.


  When this is all over, and most of your readers will probably know multiple people who died during the crisis, this would not be a good [look].


This is a global crisis that is only just beginning. By the time the dust settles, millions may have died from the virus alone. It would be a rare reader who does not personally know someone affected. More will have died because of how overwhelmed the global healthcare system is. 

Even more will be affected by the economic fallout.

Viral infections can have lifelong consequences, even if you live. 

If you're in a medical field, many of  your readers will be caregivers who were worked to the bone for months, and had to make impossible triage decisions. 

For your readers, researchers are forced to halt research, often at great expense. Many studies cannot be paused for three months and picked up at the same place. 

And you're proposing to put in your acknowledgements ""gee I got so much done while quarantined!"" This is offensive at best, and obscene at worst. We in universities are extremely lucky that our pay will most likely not be stopped, and we can just pick up and work from home. That is not happening for most of the nation. 

Frankly, I would be ashamed to be your co-author, and if you were in my field, put you on blast across every channel I knew how. Do not do this.

"During these unprecedented times, it is quite hard to predict whether any recently advertised academic jobs will be still available next fall, as some countries might enforce social distancing or lockdown for a whole year. Still, many conferences are cancelled or delayed this year, thus getting papers published harder, alongside with academic path progression. I guess that we should be trying to get journal papers accepted instead...

Given that I am at the end of a fixed term assistant professor position (looking possibly forward for an open term/tenure track one), I'm asking if it will be possible that universities will still be hiring new APs when they might be asked to close until further notice (e.g, UK). Is it still possible that some degrees will convert all of their modules  into on-line classes (e.g., for Computer Science), thus allowing universities to get the same number of students they expected in the following academic year? This is still a relevant question - I think -, as the hiring of new junior accademic staff goes hand in hand with an expected increased amount of students on campus. Do you have any insight on this, or do you think that it is too early to make any possible educated guess? 

Thanks a lot for your suggestions.
","The road to the future is never smooth and upward trending. It is bumpy. In the current chaotic situation, expect chaos in the short term. Others, such as myself, have experienced career setbacks due to circumstances we can't control. I finished my doctorate at a time when the market for mathematicians was one of zero demand and massive supply. But over time, the bumps eased out for us. Perhaps, and we hope, they will for you also. But prediction of the future is an uncertain business riddled with errors among fantastic claims. 

Unfortunately too many governments around the world are behaving incompetently, making everything worse. But in the long run, climate change will probably have a bigger effect than the current pandemic. And it is also being ignored by some governments. 

However, unless we are willing to give up scientific study altogether and unless we are willing to give up educating the citizenry for the future, there is a lot of incentive to continue as we have as much as we can within the constraints that we see. Universities have many incentives to maintain their services and their structures. Most feel an obligation to faculty, students, society, and science itself. Those are strong positive forces. 

The incentives, however, need to be met with action. We don't have answers yet to some important questions. One of the questions is how meaningful and complete we can make an education without face to face interactions. Another is how we can continue some sorts of research, say lab sciences, without physical labs staffed by researchers. These are hard questions. It will take some innovation. Conferences could, in principle, move to virtual space, just as ""classroom"" education is doing now. 

Fortunately we are in a better place today than even 20 years ago with fairly ubiquitous internet communication. Some of the problems are probably solvable relatively quickly. 

But we don't know how many students will seek higher education in the next couple of years. We don't know how taxing authorities will deal with funding education in the face of economic disruption. Some, but not all, signs are positive. But uncertainty is high. Budgets, needs for faculty, working conditions, etc. All in flux. 

I suspect that the careers of people in your situation will be disrupted for a while, as mine was. But I also suspect that the situation will improve for you, though it may take some years to do so. Provided, of course, that we don't kill the planet along the way. 

Try to find a way to be healthy and happy, even if your short term goals must change. Try to use the internet to stay connected. Try to stay as productive as possible given the constraints. Apply for what positions there are, and for positions that you might not have considered if times were better.

"I am applying to do a master's thesis at a German research institute. The institute's website encourages applicants to contact the researchers directly (and does not give more information about the application process). I have been wondering whether initiating this contact over phone could be a way to make a strong first impression, and would make it less likely that my subsequent application mail will disappear in their inbox. The goal of the phone call would be to ask whether their group has an open spot for a master's student etc. On the other hand, I am worried I would be breaking some social code by making such direct contact with someone 'higher up in the hierarchy', or that they would think I am wasting their time by calling in person. 

So, my question is: Would it be appropriate to phone a researcher/academic with such inquiries?

I realize this will depend on the person being called, but I think it is still possible to answer whether this is generally acceptable within cultural norms. 

Note: Many, but not all, of the researchers list a phone number on the institute's homepage.
","I don't appreciate being called; it imposes your time schedule on me. Others differ. However, I suspect that email is your safest bet.

The practical problem is that many universities in Germany have been closed due to COVID-19, and the numbers listed will be the work numbers. Either you are calling an empty office, or your call is forwarded to the persons home adress, which may not be what you want.

@MassimoOrtolano makes a good point in emphasizing the unannounced part of a phone call. You could sent an email to make an appointment. I would be fine with that.

","Yes, by all means keep looking for a position. The future is unknown. Things may settle down or not, but it would be a mistake to wait until they do before you even begin a search. But email responses may be slower than usual and people may need to be more tentative. Expect that.

"I'm currently in my undergraduate junior year studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada. I'm hoping to apply for Top 10 US grad schools in mechanical engineering in about 18 months. In response to the worldwide COVID-19 health crisis, our institution has (as have most academic institutions) switched to online teaching and made many changes to the structure of our courses to accommodate the situation.

As part of these changes, the university has offered students the option to selectively change the grade reporting on their transcripts to CR/NCR (Credit/No Credit) at the end of this semester. Normally, my grades would be pretty good (hovering around ~3.9 GPA) and I wouldn't bother to report my grades as a CR instead of as a percentage, but this crisis has completely disoriented me and made it difficult to focus on my studies.

Furthermore, the university has allowed instructors to retroactively adjust the course breakdown/weighting away from the original syllabus--this means that tests/projects that were originally worth 15% of the grade might have been increased to upwards of 40% weighting. This has had a negative impact on my course grades as well, as I was hoping to make up for poor showings on some of these lower-weight deliverables with strong final exam performances. Instead, these final exams are going to be worth much less now.

In the aftermath of these changes, I'm contemplating using the CR/NCR option on some of my course grades, particular with any grade that ends up lower than my current GPA. However, I'm worried about how this will be interpreted in my grad school admissions in a couple years. In normal circumstances, I think changing a percentage grade into a CR/Pass grade would be a red flag that a student's performance in the class was less-than-stellar.

Given the COVID-19 crisis and its effects on academia as a whole, are admissions committees two years down the road likely to be understanding if I decide to take advantage of the CR option now? Should I make use of it and explain that this was ""the coronavirus semester"" in my application package, or am I dooming myself by converting my grades from percentage into CRs?
","The situation is chaotic and it is difficult to make a prediction or give firm advice. Either path could be better than the other, depending on the judgments of others. 

However, one prediction that I can make with confidence is that universities sending out grades will also be sending out explanations that extraordinary measures were taken in extraordinary times. Furthermore those receiving grades and such will understand that the situation was chaotic and that the ordinary procedures need to be modified. 

If it were me, I'd probably opt for the grades rather than pass/fail. If necessary, I'd just explain that the general chaos affected my performance somewhat and the grades may not accurately reflect my potential. I'd suspect that letter writers would back that up. But that is partly because I'd have a history of excellent performance generally and not one that would be questioned in the absence of the current situation. (This is the hypothetical me speaking, not the real me.)

But the pass fail option can also be explained fairly easily that the risks were higher due to general disruption and you considered it the safer option as the rules were changing, making earlier assumptions invalid. 

I expect that there will be more emphasis put on interviews and on letters of recommendation for a while until things settle down again. But that is just a guess.

"OK. Short version, I'm stuck on my PhD because of coronavirus. My university is giving me an extension to my thesis deadline, but I am going to run out of funding pretty soon. 

I'm looking at marketable skills I can use to generate a bit of income to bridge the gap, and one of these is scientific writing. I know that there are plenty of people out there who have English as a second language, or who don't express themselves fluently and I think they'd be interested in proofreading / light copy editing. I absolutely don't want to become an essay mill, and I don't want to help people to cheat.

Can anyone advise me on the ethics of this? Where do the boundaries lie?

Thanks!
","Proofreading and even light editing for proper language usage and understandability should not be an issue at all. You are not contributing to the actual work, just to its explanation. Advisors sometimes do this sort of thing. 

I'll assume of course that the theses you read aren't fundamentally about the language itself. But proofreading a math paper, say, helping the author to find the right English or German or whatever words and phrases for expressibility is ok as long as it doesn't change the content or the ideas. I'm assuming, also, that the advice you would give is non-technical. 

However, the best way to do this is to make suggestions to the author about places in the text that need improvement, rather than doing a markup. This aids the author in developing professional language skills and helps assure that you don't cross boundaries. 

If you are in the same field then it is easy to go too far, so you need to guard against that. 



I should note that some people take a very strict view about such things and would forbid it.

"Due to the recent COVID-19 event, all of the members in our group have been working at home. My advisor proposed to get us some items to make us more productive or happy when working at home. I feel like a tablet would be very helpful in reading paper and books. Additionally, I'm working home using my small laptop and the screen is really small. It also helps if I could get a large screen to connect to my laptop. I have a bit of a quandary because those things are kind of not really necessary because, after all, I can use my laptop to read paper and work. On the other hand, they are not cheap.

  Would it be selfish for me to ask my advisor to fund me to get a monitor and tablet, those things?


Not at all! It is never selfish to ask, though it might be selfish to insist, and it might likewise be selfish if you did not make it clear that you understand your advisor has the final say in this.

It is an odd feeling asking your advisor to pay for things for you, isn't it? Many students are afraid of coming across as entitled, but the better approach is to be matter-of-fact and professional about it. Simply explain (in a short message to your advisor)


The item(s) you want to get;
In a nutshell (1 sentence), why this item would help you be more productive and comfortable working at home;
The specific estimate on price or price range.


Don't phrase it as a demand; just state what you are thinking of, and then ask: ""Would it be possible to reimburse this item?""


  My advisor proposed to get us some items to make us more productive or happy when working at home.


Based on your this, I agree with the top answer that it is overwhelmingly likely your advisor will be fine with getting you these items. But articulating (1), (2), and (3) above will help make this more concrete, and phrasing it as a question makes it easy for your advisor to say no if they think that one of the items is excessive.

"I am a English PhD student (focusing on literature), but this year one of my assistantships through my university has involved some grant writing for local non-profits. Recently I've been working on a small grant for a local non-profit, which will help this non-profit pay for some consultants to help it develop a strategic plan and more effective organization. (The grant is offered by a foundation that focuses on capacity-building support for non-profits in the city where I live.) Because of the impacts of COVID-19 on the non-profit sector (i.e., many of our organization's donation funds are likely to dry up), our hired consultants have generously offered to do their work pro bono. 

Here's my question: what is the etiquette of letting a grant funder know their funds are no longer needed for a specific project? To clarify, I was pretty far into the grant writing process (original LOI / project proposal approved, directed to the next steps in the application process) when we learned we'd no longer need the funds for the consultation fees. (The foundation that has offered the funds is a major donor to local non-profits, so there is a good chance that we'll be applying to them again in the future--just for a different project.) Since I corresponded a lot with a representative of the foundation, I feel like I should follow up to let them know, especially as we may be applying to them again in the future ... what are others' thoughts on this issue?

(If there's a better StackExchange community for posting this question, I apologize!)
","I would ask the representative. Procedures differ wildly from funding agency to funding agency. 

However, I would not be worried: everybody acted in good faith, and you are asking for less money. So in all likelihood the response will just be a short email thanking you for letting them know, and telling you that they look forward to receiving new applications from you in the future.

"I wrote an email to my professor yesterday to ask makeup exam. But he doesn't reply until now.

Test was taken a week ago. But, I can't take it because of family emergency(my grandfather passed away) and sudden move into new room (my hostfamily kicked me out without prior notice.I think the reason is outbreak of covid-19, and I'm Asian). Those are my nightmare! 

In your opinion, can he admit my makeup test? and why doesn't he reply my email...?
","Expecting an overnight reply to any email is unrealistic. He may have some issues of his own to deal with, given the worldwide pandemic. He will probably reply ""in good time"", but by his standards. 

Whether you are allowed to take a make up or not we can't say here. It is up to him and to the institution. I hope it is allowed and expect it would be given the family emergency. But the other things you mention have little bearing on the issue. 

But waiting a week after the missed exam wasn't wise, and expecting an instant reply after you didn't offer an explanation for a week is a bit ""over the top"". 

I suggest that you wait to see what the reply is. There probably isn't really a need for instant action at this point.

"I am a professor at uni, and I have been experiencing a number of unreasonable requests from students on these days, some of them arguing that they need a special treatment due to the current Covid-19 situation, such as students asking for:


additional exam papers with full solutions (there are already three past exam papers with solutions available).
a list of the exact topics that will be examined in each of the exam exercises (this is, if the exam contains five questions, then I should provide the corresponding five topics).
providing the exact structure of the exam, such as one question about definitions, two questions about chapter 1 of the lecture notes, one question about chapter 2, ...
labeling slides and clearly specifying if they cover a topic that will appear in the exam or not (not just if it contains examinable material, but if the exam contains a question about the topic in the corresponding slide).


I want to reply to these requests indicating that they are just asking for too much (I may as well send them the exam with full solutions), and to teach them that the point of the exam is not to regurgitate memorized solutions (i.e., life does not work like that).

What is some advice on potential ways of replying and covering both aims: being polite, but also educating them about how unreasonable/entitled those requests are?
","Let's assume your teaching practices are the best possible.  Students want you to change your teaching practices.  You should respond by explaining to students why your practices are effective (do this even if they don't ask).

  additional exam papers with full solutions (there are already three
  past exam papers with solutions available).


Studying the three past exams will help you learn what you need to learn from this class.  Additional past exams will not provide additional help.  If you have extra time, I suggest you ...

  exercises (this is, if the exam contains 5 questions, then I should
  provide the corresponding 5 topics).

","
  Can I rightfully refuse to use the school's platform?


TL;DR: legally, probably not, but you are still more or less in the right according to the norms of academia.

Longer answer:

This isn’t so much about rights in the legal sense. The underlying context is that there is a longstanding tradition in academia that faculty own the rights to written (and other) media they create as part of their work. This is the case in the US where these rights are pretty universally respected as far as I’m aware, and in many other countries, and is true despite the fact that legally, in the US at least, employers in general can (and, outside of academia, generally do) assert ownership of all intellectual property generated by employees in a work context.

In other words, academic institutions have quite intentionally and explicitly given up some of the legal ownership rights they are in principle entitled to. As far as I understand, the guiding philosophy here is that faculty exercise a lot more freedom and control over what kind of materials they produce compared to employees in other sectors. That means the work is regarded as being of a more personal, creative nature, and it was decided long ago that that should mean that faculty would be the owners of the work. (Note: I am talking specifically about copyright; for other forms of IP like patent rights, a quite different philosophy and different policies typically apply.)

Coming back to your question: I think you are quite right to be concerned. Your university is at the very least showing itself as somewhat deaf to these very old and well-established ideas. But can you “rightfully refuse”? Legally, that’s less clear. But it would be quite reasonable to express a concern. At my university the administration has provided reassurance to faculty that their copyright over teaching materials would be respected during the COVID-19 crisis, and we were given quite specific explanations on how our rights would be balanced against the need to deliver our teaching remotely, including providing recordings, what steps we can take to prevent students from sharing our materials, and more. Perhaps by raising the issue you and your colleagues can push your own administration to also think this through a bit more.

Let me finish by encouraging you to also adopt a more flexible and tolerant mindset. All of us are called upon these days to get out of our comfort zone and appear in online videos and recordings, use online platforms with awful records on privacy, and generally engage in activities that in normal times we might consider distasteful and privacy-violating. We do this with the understanding that exceptional times call for exceptional measures, and that the highest priority right now is to keep the lights on at our institutions. As I said, I think your concern is reasonable and probably you can reach some sensible understanding with your administration about your class materials. But while you discuss the issue with them, try to keep some perspective and not make yourself too much of a pain in the butt. As important and valid as this is, people do have worse things to worry about these days.

"I am a junior at a large state university. Lately, as you all have probably heard, the coronavirus is spreading like a wildfire and we all should be scared.

My instructor is from China, and my school is also filled with Asian students. How do I ask for excused absences so that I can stay at home for the lectures so that I won't get the virus from my instructor or my Asian classmates? Do I contact the chair of the department that's offering the course or the dean of the school? Would it be better if I ask to switch to an online class instead (it's already after the add/drop period)

Some suggestion would be helpful.
","You should do none of these things and we should not all be scared. This would be panic reaction.

You have not said in which country you are studying, but the Health authorities of most governments have issued official advice to their citizens which you should follow. Most institutions, such as universities, will also have issued official advice which you should also read and follow.

If you are in the UK the Department of Health has provided advice to UK universities.

If you wanted personal action, using hand cleansing gel dispensers provided by the university will reduce incidents of cross contamination and ensure regular hand-washing is your best defence.

"Background:
I hold citizenship of a country included in the Exchange Visitor Skill list for J1 visa holders (my research area, biological sciences, is on the list as well). My postdoc project is funded by NIH/NSF grants to the lab (not in a university). I completed a Ph.D. in a major US university last year, and my work authorization is under the F1 OPT. In light of diminishing faculty openings, I do not have a strong preference for staying in academia long term.

Details:
I started my current (and first) postdoc position a few months back, and this position is funded for the next few years. My advisor has been great, and she is supportive. I am also satisfied with the progress being made in the project. 

Due to the increased visa denials, I was advised to wait for the next visa and not leave the US during the OPT period. The HR informed me that J1 is the only option as per the organization policy, and my advisor is powerless even if she wants to help. I did not know that non-University entities could sponsor J1 and thought H1B was the only choice (a significant reason for choosing this position; my bad.) 

If I take J1, I will be subject to the two year home residency rule (which is the worst; the economy in my home country (a banana republic) is in shambles). Being on OPT would make it extremely risky to leave the US, and the status of the OPT STEM extension is uncertain. These factors make me want to look for new opportunities with H1B sponsorship. However, the fact that my advisor has been supportive and having to leave after a few months without any publication makes me feel incredibly guilty. I would appreciate perspectives on this issue.
","Being a postdoc is a job. You are not a slave for academia, nor is your reasearch so important (no offense) that you have to continue it no matter what happens to your life. (Nobody's research is.)*

You are a professional and should act as such. There is nothing to be guilty about. Any reasonable person knows and understands that there are reasons which end one's participation in a project even if there is no ""outcome"" of the project. Probably your supervisor would feel more guilty if you feel the need to stay just because of them.

I do not mean to be harsh -- it is only human to feel guilty about such things. What would you do if your were the supervisor?
Talk about your feelings with your friends -- emotional questions like this are better discussed with trusted people than on the Internet.

*Just for completeness, given the recent situation: If you were an absolute key person in the research of coronavirus and countermeasures, maybe it could be argued that you should stay until you transferred all your knowledge.

"I am currently teaching a basic R programming course with about 80 students.
Under normal circumstances,
a core course assessment component is a programming exam,
which is done in the computer lab using the lab computers.
I will arrange for the Internet to be cut off,
and we will have exam invigilators who are patrolling the exam venue
to detect or dissuade students from cheating.
At the end of the exam, the Internet is restored,
and students submit an R script (basically programming code)
using the course learning management system.

This semester, due to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19),
the university where I work has replaced all on-campus teaching activities with online teaching for the entire semester!


With regards to teaching,
the faculty have been asked to teach our classes online using Zoom,
which gives students the freedom to take classes wherever they like.
With regards to exams,
the faculty have been asked to administer their course exams online,
with students completing the exams online from home. (What??!!)


I am very concerned about students taking exams online from home,
because I am worried that some or many of the students may use this as an opportunity to cheat on the exam —
whether it is collaborating with their classmates,
or even asking another student to take the exam in their place.

My questions:


Is there any way to detect if students are cheating (e.g., sharing answers),
when students are doing an online quiz or exam at home?
Is there a way to dissuade students from cheating?


Response to comments:


How much help do you have for these 80 students?

I do have one PhD student who is a grader.
She is supposed to spend about 6 hours a week to help with the course.

","I also teach a data and programming course, though I mainly use Python.

Is it possible for you to shift grading away from an exam and toward something else?  A project, for example?  Before going back to academia I spent years working as a policy researcher, and exam conditions simply aren't a realistic test of real-life coding abilities.  For that matter, coding with the internet turned off is also not remotely what real work looks like either.

In my class I like to give a larger project and let them have a few weeks to work on it, but I could also imagine a more simple project that they only have a few days, or even hours, to do.  Real data work often comes with time constraints, but it does not come with a lack of internet access in exam-like conditions.  Just scale the scope of the project based on how long you want them to have to work on it.

There is still a huge advantage to knowing the material, rather than having to look it up.  You can also grade on the quality of code and correctness of results, and allow for creativity with open-ended questions like ""summarize this data with two plots"".  This way each student is not only tested their knowledge of R, they're tested on their actual ability to use R in a realistic environment.

If you, unfortunately, are required to give an exam, I know there is software available for proctoring online tests.  The sort of thing that utilizes their webcams to make sure they don't leave during the test, or consult other devices, or open other web pages.  I've not used them though, so I couldn't make a recommendation.  I imagine they all require university subscriptions.

"I am a master student expected to graduate in April. I want to work as an R/A for my thesis advisor after graduation and want to do a PhD afterwards. However, the entire school is closed and I cannot meet him in person. When I asked him about meeting after the corona is over, he said “don't worry about graduation, you will be able to graduate online”. It seems that he does not want to meet me, which makes me feel very depressed and anxious. My only option now is to write an email. I want to talk with him over several things:


Is my thesis good enough that justifies doing a PhD? If yes, is it possible that I publish it with him being coauthor?
Is it possible I become his R/a? Even if my thesis is good, that is not a guarantee.
What can I do to improve PhD chance?
Will he write me a letter of recommendation?


I think that asking all of these in one email is not a good idea. So I am thinking to start it with the email:


  Dear Prof.A, I am very grateful for your advices for my thesis.
  Without you I would not have been able to graduate. I learned a lot
  from you and now that the thesis is finished, I discovered my passion
  for research and realize that this is what I want to do for the rest
  of my life. I have some questions, I would be very grateful if you can
  answer them:
  
  
  do you think my thesis is good enough justify me going to phd. If it is good can we coauthor on my thesis and publish. That sounds a bit
  too arrogant from my part, so I do not know how to word it.
  Is it possible I become your r.a. Your research is very interesting and you taught me so much during our time working together . I wish to
  learn more from you.
  Do you have any advice for me to get into good Phd school?
  
  
  thank you so much again!
  regards,
  B


Can you give me some advice? I am very depressed and anxious to the point I cannot move for many days.
","
  “don't worry about graduation, you will be able to graduate online”


In this context, I would translate your advisor's thought process as:


  This student sounds like they are anxious and worried about graduation. The best way I can help them worry less is to simply tell them not to worry.


Nothing there about wanting to meet or not. Indeed, if your advisor does not want to meet in person, it's more likely to stay out of the public and help contribute to reducing disease spread.

I think it's fine to write an email with some bullet points about things you'd like to discuss further. Thank them for reassuring you about graduation, but make it clear that there are in fact things you could use advice on besides just a path to graduating.

Then you can ask whether the professor would prefer to discuss those things over email, to meet via phone or video chat (like Skype, Google Hangouts), or to meet in person.

Be as patient as you can be, because this is likely a stressful time for everyone. Your advisor may not be able to meet or respond right away - don't let that worry you.

"Would Nature, Science or other leading academic journals prioritize publishing work on COVID-19, the novel coronavirus that has caused more than 3k deaths so far?  If so, has this happened before in the past, during another crisis?
","Absolutely. Journals are ways of disseminating scientific information, and they do take into account what is of current interest.

More specifically, however: Both Science and Nature do not just publish scientific articles, but also commentary and news stories. For example, in Science they are in the ""News"" and ""Perspectives"" parts of the magazine, and they definitely cover current events. As, if I may add, they should.

"A great many top US physics PhD programs have canceled their open houses with no plan to reschedule.

Some are intended on running ""virtual open houses."" Other's are just sending links to information that could be found on the internet regarding their program.

Is the April 15th requirement of a decision regarding accepting grad school offers of admission still ethical?

Is it reasonable to propose that April 15th be moved a month or two later?

A STEM PhD could take anywhere from 4-7 years in the US. That is a non-trivial amount of your life.
","
You presumably did some research before deciding on where to apply to in the first place. That research is still valid. Any other contact with the institution(s) and faculty add to that basis of judgement. 
You seem to presume that there is one uniquely right answer on your choice, and that getting to that one answer requires attending an open house. Likely, almost any choice could turn out well, or turn out badly, all depending on factors totally divorced from the open house. 
Note that many people accept without having been to an open house. So, the decision can be made without going to one. 
You seem to presume that actions to reduce the spread of the virus are unethical, something that I would hotly contest. 

"
"I'm a senior TA helping out my instructor with restructuring the course in light of the coronavirus causing in-class cancellations at our university.  We have tools allowing our students to do their programming labs online, and therefore our class can still run, but we still have a lab practical that's a huge part of students' grades, and I personally would prefer that that not be replaced by some generic homework.  

Would any of you happen to know of ways to make secure environments where a website (in this case, the tool allowing students to do their labs) could be loaded?  The student shouldn't be able to navigate to another tab or close full screen, and the website immediately submits code to the server when the time for the virtual ""exam"" is up.  

I've tried searching for examples myself, but I'm not sure if I'm wording my problem correctly because I don't get any relevant results.  I'd really appreciate the examples you have.  Thank you in advance!
","As already outlined in some of the comments, it is impossible to achieve what you want: You cannot control a computer to this extent without a severe invasion that would go far beyond anything that I would allow you to do on my computer due to privacy and security concerns. Unless you want to video-monitor students, you can also not prevent students from using a second computer, a virtual machine, or having somebody else working on their computer for them. And even then you need at least two cameras to see everything that the student is doing or that is happening to them and you would have to frequently check that they are working themselves, did not rig the video, etc.

On a more general level, controlling cheating on any exam that is based on limiting resources is already difficult if you do it in a setting that you can control (i.e., your room, your computers, your toilets, etc.).
By taking this battle to the “enemy’s territory” and limiting your knowledge, you can only lose.

I would thus suggest the following alternative.
This is how my programming practicals were done when I was a student.
I also successfully applied this to a programming “exam” in a course I co-organised.


The students do the programming practical with no restrictions except time.
For example, they may use the entire Internet, course material, etc.
After they submit the code, there is a short oral exam on the code.
Depending on the details of your course, you can very this exam in length and relevance, with the extreme examples being:


You grade the code and the oral exam only serves to ensure that the students didn’t cheat (and may be as short as five minutes).
You only check that the code is doing what it’s supposed to do, while the oral exam determines the grade and may also contain questions about other aspects of the course and deeper understanding.
Here, the oral exams may cost more time, but you also spend less time looking at their submissions.

If applicable, also perform plagiarism checks on the code.


Some pros and cons of this approach:


You somehow have to organise remote oral exams, but these could be just via the phone, if that suffices to establish the examinee’s identity for you. Also be prepared that this mode will amplify anxiety, language, and other issues for some students (while it reduces them for others).
You may need to modify your tasks to account for full Internet access and similar, for example it should not be anything to which a bazillion of solutions exists.
Depending on your topic, this may be very difficult.
The exam is more realistic: except for taking exams, your students will have Internet access for the rest of their career and using it properly is also a relevant skill.
The oral exam allows you to gauge actual understanding, whereas the purely written exam may be solved by rote-memorising algorithms, etc.   
In case of group work, you do not need to worry much about some incompetent student benefiting from a stronger partner.
(I am aware that this point doesn’t apply to you; I mention it only for completeness.)

"I was invited to give a talk at an important conference, which has now been canceled due to coronavirus. Can I still list the fact that I was invited on my CV, with a parenthetical note? It's not the same as if I turned down an invitation or failed to show up. Obviously this is not really that big of a deal and I can accept it if that's not a suitable thing to do, but I'm trying to find a silver lining.
","Yes. I had a similar experience where my agency restricted travel and did not allow me to present. In my case, I listed that the presentation was delivered by someone else who could attend.

Matching the style of your CV, I would write something like:


  Academic, F. My cool title. Awesome conference. City, State. March 2020. Invited oral presentation. Unable to deliver, meeting canceled due to COVID-19 outbreak.


Based upon personal experience, I will now be adding a similar entry to my own CV. Also, based upon some of the comments, here's why I would list an invited talk even if the talk was not delivered: The invitation is an honor in itself because it shows people recognize you, at some level, as an expert on a topic. Thus, the invitation has value besides simply delivering the actual talk.

"I was recently accepted by a college or university.  I was planning on graduating from high school soon and then enrolling in college.  My high school has just announced that it will be closed for a reason such as the COVID-19/coronavirus pandemic.  Will I still be able to start college?

(Question limited to students who are already admitted.)
","Ask them.
You mentioned that they accepted you already. Only they can tell you whether the admission process is affected by the recent events and whether they're willing to accomodate last minute changes to your academic schedule.
"
"I applied for a faculty position and did a video interview. It was supposed that they let me know if I have been selected for campus or not. In the middle of the interview with other candidates, this COVID-19 happened and I am not sure what strategy they will take as the target university has canceled all in-person classes and shifted to an online model. 

Would it be appropriate to ask the committee about the status of the search?

What factors would affect the university's response in such a case?
","It’s certainly appropriate to ask. Virus or not, the world will move on from this crisis, hopefully in a timeframe of a few months, you will still need a job, and the university will still need faculty to teach classes and do research. Students will still need to be educated. Higher education can be affected by economic recession, put probably less so than many other sectors of the economy. So don’t panic.

So yes, it’s fine to send them an email and politely inquire about the status of the search. Keep in mind that it’s possible they are scrambling to figure out how to keep instruction going and dealing with other urgent matters around the current crisis unrelated to faculty hiring. So the most likely response you’ll get is they are still figuring things out and don’t have any news.
"
"One question we often get on this site in one form or the other is: Is my paper under review (or similar) for too long and if yes, how should I react? Now, suppose I have gone through all the steps to answer this question in a normal situation: I have procured statistics of the journal’s handling or peer-review times, added a fair margin for individual variability, etc. My question is: How should I modify these in lights of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis? I do not want to bother editors more than appropriate.

The obvious thoughts are:


Some reviewers and editors are busy with challenges arising due to the crisis, e.g., due to having to switch to online teaching, having no childcare, etc.
On the other hand, some reviewers and editors now have more time available due to conferences being cancelled, not being able to access their labs, and similar.
Some fields are obviously directly affected by the crisis, in particular medicine, virology, and epidemiology. I am not considering those.


I am only interested in answers that go beyond such obvious thoughts, for example being based on experience as an editor.
The ideal are answers based on statistics, but those likely do not exist yet (but will be welcome when they eventually will).
","I am an associate editor for two journals, and although the situation is fairly new, I expect to have no substantive change in the time for me to handle papers.

The reasons for this are:


Pretty much everything is handled purely electronically anyway, so there's no physical interaction to be disrupted.
Reviewing is typically a sparse activity by people who are mostly always overloaded anyway, and it's always fairly low triage for people.  As such, I don't anticipate the availability of reviewers to particularly change: if people have more time, they'll fill it with things more important to them; if people have less time, I'll just have to ask a few more to find a full reviewer set.
The time to review is typically dominated by the time that a manuscript ages quietly on the reviewer's desk before the review deadline arrives --- actually carrying out a review often does not take all that much time, by comparison. The number of weeks we give our reviewers isn't going to change, so that dominating time won't either.
Because of the preceding factors, there's already a lot of stochasticity in time to review. Even if it does go up a bit, I doubt it will be readily detectable against the background of stochasticity.

"
"I am a Master's student in epidemiology. It's an insane time in our field right now. Of course, I find what's going on fascinating (that's why I am in this field), but extremely stressful as well. 

I have 2 advisors. My primary advisor is not working on COVID-19 related stuff. So, although she's really busy trying to re-plan all of her classes to be remote and just reorganize everything, she is not responding directly to the outbreak. My co-advisor, however, is on the response team for the outbreak in my country. Basically, she is working with the government to create models to predict the trajectory of the disease. I had a meeting with her 1.5 weeks ago and she said basically all she has on her mind is COVID-19. That was before the world went into quarantine so I imagine things have become even busier for her. 

My primary advisor sent me an email today talking about how to move forward and in the email she mentioned that it does depend on how busy my co-advisor is (but also assured me we would figure this all out). 

Unfortunately, the project I am working on now is a modelling project and my primary advisor isn't a modeller, so it's my co-advisor that needs to move the project forward. I still have other things to do for my thesis, but I am almost done those other things and I am just in the editing stages. I have a lot more to do on my modelling project, but my co-advisor is extremely busy right now. I am finished what she asked me to do a couple of weeks ago and want to send it to her.

Sorry for the long post explaining my situation. My question is, should I send her the things the I have finished or would that be a bit tone-deaf? What should I even say in the email? I don't want to come off as not caring about the biggest health crisis in at least a decade while asking her to review something that's not even related to COVID-19. How should I even frame the email or should I hold off from sending her things for a few weeks? 

If it makes a difference, although I do have an office, I can do 100% of my work remotely (and do usually work from home at least 3 days a week). 
","As someone who's been out of academia for a while, I would like to offer a different perspective. Yes, occupying your co-advisor's attention when the roof is on fire is tone-deaf. However: you have acquired skills that are obviously in high demand these days, and are thrown into a (hopefully) once-in-a lifetime situation to apply these skills. Especially since you're not on a strict deadline with your thesis, there are now more important things than finishing the thesis at the scheduled time. See this as an opportunity, not an obstacle.

Check if this is okay with your primary advisor, then send a mail to your co-advisor saying that you would be glad to put your thesis on ice and help her with her COVID work if she has anything you could be of help with. If you are a capable student, she probably will.  

Then, when things have calmed down, reevaluate the situation, see what you have learned in the meantime, and continue from there.

"My university, like many others, has recently moved to remote teaching in response to the corona virus situation. In my department, the faculty have taken the lead on finding and adopting solutions to the difficulties posed by the transition. I am a postdoc and not directly involved in a lot of the big changes. But I wonder if the faculty are sealing their fate, being so helpful when there is a counterparty, the administration, that may not have the faculty's best interests at heart (note, I have no direct knowledge either way). 

Specifically, barring any big disasters in remote teaching these next weeks/months, I would guess 1) smaller schools close to insolvency, many of which have closed these last few years, would instead have an opportunity to cut costs by dispensing with or heavily decreasing in-person instruction, without facing the PR issues or other pushback that would otherwise bring, and 2) even in schools with secure finances, or where it is unrealistic to get rid of in-person instruction, professors would lose a lot of bargaining power in any negotiations with the administration, since they will be regarded as that much less necessarily. Possibly the next few weeks/months will demonstrate that the professors are in fact less necessary, and remote learning is perhaps preferable. I am not really asking about that, my question is more selfish as someone going on the job market soon. Are these outcomes likely? This type of concern must be on the radar of professors' unions, no?
","Well, based on the 3 institutions I have close contact with, their attempts in the past few weeks hardly represent a shining example of hugely successful online learning! It feels more like the Keystone Kops!

That bit of snark out of the way, effective teaching in the online/MOOC/e-channel, etc. is not easy, and making the transition between a face to face course and an effective online course requires a lot of thought and a lot of design a prep, which of course no-one has has time to do this time around. So my snark was not meant as a true criticism, but at the same time, it means that mainstream universities' efforts in the balance of this semester are themselves unlikely to make anyone -- teachers or learners -- say, ""hey, that went really well; let's dispense with classroom instruction altogether"".

That being said, I do think this will strongly accelerate the shift towards e-learning in the medium- and long-term, and that in 2 ways.


In the long term, this will make e-learning a much more mainstream offering that students and faculty will become more comfortable exploring and integrating into the curriculum. Forced immersion brings familiarity and less fear. Up to now, in North America at least, we tended to have old-school in-person institutions, a few more e-learning focused disruptor institutions, and a select few dabbling in MOOCs layered on top of their usual approach. There was a lot of mutual mistrust. That will lessen. And just like a greater degree of teleworking throughout the economy, with the Pandora's box on it opened, will persist past current social isolation, so will demand for -- and willingness of faculty to explore -- e-learning.
Next year, there will be a lot of financially and emotionally wounded students, whose life plan took a pretty big hit. Some will be keen and able to return to their university campuses and continue as before. Some won't be, and when they get their affairs in order a few years later, in a world that will have lived through months of forced virtual work and socialization, they will probably be keener to explore online offerings than they were previously. And the more they start work somewhere and become mature learners, or the more straitened their financial circumstances become, the more they will seek out good-value-for-money education with schedule and geographic flexibility, and the less they'll be keen to return and pay for the conventional on-campus student experience. Of course that won't apply to all, but I suspect to enough that it will make a difference at the macro level.

"I am currently in a job in the US (on STEM OPT). I had a postdoc offer from a large US university that was supposed to start April 16. I signed an offer letter for a two year contract. We were in the process of deciding which visa to apply for (H1/J1). 

Today I got an email from the PI (HR copied) saying she would like to put the position on hold until things settle down. I asked for a clarification on what ""on hold"" meant and whether the offer letter was still valid. The HR replied this (PI copied):


  As for the offer letter you signed (due to redacted’s current
  situation) please consider it void until future notice.
  
  Professor [redacted] will contact you if you are still being considered
  for the position.


This is the last communication I had with the HR or the PI.

What does this mean? Since I have the signed offer, when things do settle down, is the university legally obligated to offer the position back to me before anyone else? Or the university is formally rescinding the offer and I should just move on? Can they do that? 

EDIT: Some answers have asked about my eligibility to work in the US. For clarification: I’m in the US now, in my current status, I can work in the US till the end of May. If the university applied for an H1B (which is typically approved for non profit), I could stay in the US as long as I didn’t leave the country (in which case I would have to get a visa stamped). Things could have gotten more complicated with J1, so we did not discuss much about that. 
","A signed offer letter is normally a valid contract.  Usually it is the only contract document.  Only someone who has read the offer letter can give you a perfect answer to this question.

They have announced their intention to break the contract.  That is illegal unless the offer letter says otherwise.  Moving on is probably your best option.  

There are two possibilities:


The university is unable to pay you, so they are forced to do something that could potentially cause them a lot of harm in the form of bad press or litigation.
They did this voluntarily or out of incompetence, in which case the university is a bad place to work and you are lucky not to be working there.


In either case, you should look for employment elsewhere.
"
"I am a STEM teaching assistant. I know some professors were using physical class materials in engineering classes. How do you think they should respond to COVID-19-forced online education and still ensure the quality of their classes?

It is a purposefully broad question. I was curious to hear what you think about the near term or futuristic/ideal approaches that could change STEM education. 
","It seems that pretty much everything must now be done in virtual space. And, of course, this is hard to arrange in the short term. But in addition to videos, there is the possibility of software to provide hands-on simulation in some cases. It might be worth the effort in some fields to pair up (virtually) with a good programmer who can build quick simulations for student use. These can be refined later. 

The really hard fields, though, are things like training surgeons, but even there, simulation can get you partway home. 

Some fields, maybe physics, already have a lot of simulation software that is normally used. So some people have experience building such things. See if your university has someone or can find someone to help.

"I am a masters of mathematics student in Asia and I wrote to some professors for PH D position in number theory. One of the professors in France said yes to me but he said that I should look for other sources of funding as his university didn't had PhD funding at that time. There is one scholarship Foundation in my country where I was thinking of applying as a potential candidate. But the Conditions are that I should have a written appropval from my prospective guide. 

In between I began preparing for my mid term exams and then appearing for them and masters dissertation viva . As I got spare time, the covid-19  outbreak spread. It's not to worry about here but I came to know through news that it's very serious in France and whole Europe. Also, last date for applying to scholarship portal is 31 March and it will not be extended. 


  So , should I ask to my prospective guide to write a confirmation letter in the middle of Covid-19 in his country. Doesn't this show that I am an emotionless person with no etiquette at all who doesn't even care about in what situation my prospective guide, his family and his colleagues are? 

","It is fine to ask. Life goes on as best we can manage. The situation is worldwide, of course, and we don't yet see the end of it. 

In a letter, you could, if you wish, say you are sorry if the request is coming at a bad time and that you understand the global situation. 

You may not be able to get a reply in time, of course, or at all. But there is no problem asking. There is only a week left. 

And note that people will want to start up as normal again as soon as the situation allows. Things may be delayed.

"The chair of my department has very generously offered to try and secure funding for some of the part-time and adjunct professors working in the department as compensation for adapting our originally in-person courses to an online format (this is in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic).  I currently am an adjunct only teaching one upper-division class at this institution.  The catch here is that my chair has asked me and the other part-timers to throw out numbers that we feel are appropriate.  I really have no intuition about what to ask for, or to simply respond (graciously) saying that I trust my chair's judgement and allow them to come up with a number for me/us.  I don't want to come off as greedy and pick a number they might claim to be inappropriate, but at the same time I feel that it's rather passive to blindly let my chair pick.

For reference, I'm a fairly new hire in this department and not really clear about my future there.  The chair and the other faculty are very friendly and inviting, so I'm not particularly worried about setting off any personality conflicts.  Just not sure what the appropriate response is here.
","There are really two parts to the Chair's question:


How much additional work have you had to do so far? What additional work do you anticipate going forward? Are there any time savings that should also go into the calculation?
What is the appropriate renumeration for that work?


You should be able to estimate the answer to (1), and explain where the number comes from. You should certainly include this information in your response to the chair. Then, as in the answer by @Allure, you can propose that they pay you for the additional time at (broadly) the same rate as you usually expect to get. For example,


  Hello,
  
  I estimate that I've had to spend 80 hours preparing new material, and
  there will be an additional 4 hours work each week going forward.
  However, I'm saving an hour on travelling between campuses. Assuming
  this continues for the next 12 weeks, we're looking at something like
  120 hours additional work. I think my usual salary works out at around
  $30/hour.
  
  Thanks, 
  Mndifldz


Note that all you have done here is state facts, so there is nothing anyone can criticise you for. You leave it up to the chair to do the maths, and decide what they can afford to offer. However, you lead them towards a number that (hopefully) you think is fair. 
"
"Due to coronavirus, many places have been forced to shift to remote online exams.  Have any schools issued guidance about the acceptability of proctoring online exams by requiring students to use a webcam to share a video of themselves taking the exam?  For instance, one could have students join a group video call where teaching assistants can monitor the video stream of students taking the exam.

I could imagine there might be privacy concerns about this practice.  Have any universities either adopted this practice for some of their exams or prohibited this practice?
","This puts students on unequal footings. Not all students have access to webcams, a stable internet connection, or even more basic, access to a quiet room where they can work for several hours straight with no interference, for example. And what about disabled students who need special accommodation, e.g. someone to write down the answers for them because they can't move their arms, blind students who need other kinds of accommodation, etc?

Where I work, university is a public service and we can't sweep such issues under the rug. Maybe you can, but you should think long and hard about whether you want to.
"
"With covid19 continues to spread, this might affect the universities in the next semesters as the number of students might drop and many universities are offering cheap online degrees compared with the expensive traditional degrees. Who can lose a job due to covid19 in academia? Instructors with annual contracts, postdocs, adjunct-faculty, pre-tenure faculty, tenure faculty, or even all and many could universities shut down.  


Universities Issue Hiring Freezes in Response to COVID-19 
Some offers were withdrawn and one case of layoffs- see comments

","Of all the examples you name, I think only those on annual contracts have much of any risk and I think that is small. The world isn't actually ending. Universities still have their mission(s): Teaching, Research, Service. That won't change unless the disruptions are much worse than are now foreseen or even likely. 

Course delivery is being affected, but hasn't ended. Research goes on, though interrupted/slowed in some fields for safety. Funding for research is still in place and will probably continue. It will be a boon for some (biomedical) research. 

Some marginal colleges will be in trouble. Think Walden University from the Doonesbury comic, but they were in trouble before this began. Tenure Track professors are unlikely to be affected because they represent the future of the university, not some disposable resource. Postdocs have contracts and funding in place for the most part, often by grants. 

There is even a chance that the current disruption will increase the need for faculty in the short term. 

But for long term effects we need to see how the hundreds to thousands of variables now in play work out over time. And it will take time since universities have quite a bit of built-in inertia. Whether ""cheap online degrees"" have any actual value is something yet to be determined. And they may not be as cheap as you think. Some online programs are extremely expensive to create. And the issue of the actual qualifications of those who take them is important and, perhaps, doubtful. 

But even if a university were to try to deliver such a ""cheap"" degree there is the question of still needing to do research and that requires highly qualified personnel. There isn't a ""cheap online research path"" that has and likelihood of success. 

Diploma mills have a poor history, being more associated with exploitation than with excellence. 

Relax. Stay healthy. Do a good job. Climate change is a bigger risk than what we are going through in the current months. 



Some people normally employed by colleges are at risk, of course. The people who clean the dormitories and prepare meals for resident students, for example. Lots of service jobs are at risk. Likewise, there are lots of small businesses in college towns that are at risk of failure, leaving their employees (including students) without resources.

"I started grad school last September, and so far have been primarily busy with courses, but have been trying to do a little research on the side whenever I can. I recently finished all my courses though, and now I'm expected to dive into research.

My advisor hasn't assigned me a project and expects me to come up with one on my own. I don't mind this really, I like the freedom to work on whatever I want. However, this was only really feasible when I was in my lab and surrounded by senior PhD students with whom I could bounce ideas off and get a lot of guidance from. 

However, now I'm stuck at home because of the COVID19 lockdown and don't really know how to productively spend my time doing research. My advisor is busy taking care of his family at home because of the lockdown, so he isn't very responsive right now understandably. I'm all alone at home so I don't have the guidance of senior PhD students either. I've tried messaging senior PhD students but it's not fair for me to constantly be harassing them for help...

Apart from heavily guided stuff in undergrad, I have next to no real research experience... Since I assume I'll be stuck at home for the next several months, how can I be productive research wise with basically no guidance or help from anyone? I don't want to just waste the next few months...

FYI, I'm doing research in engineering but everything is done using simulations, so while I have all the tools and equipment I need to do research at home, I just don't have the experience or guidance to efficiently do so.

I've been trying to just read papers in the meantime, but I can only read so many before I get sick of it. I don't want to just be reading papers for 40 hours a week for the next 3 months...
","You can try to fill the gaps in your knowledge and skills. For example, learn some techniques that are commonly used in your field. Even if you will not need them for your immediate project, there is a chance that they will be useful for the next one. For example, if you do engineering, you are likely to need to write some code, so you can improve your software engineering skills. Your colleagues may give you some more ideas on what is useful to learn.

If you feel sick of reading papers alone, you might try to reach to other junior students and form a virtual study group where you discuss and critically analyze recently published papers. You may actually come up with some ideas for research project based on the discussions. Good luck!

"I am starting a PhD abroad, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic I cannot leave my country at the moment. My advisor has agreed that I can work remotely (starting later is not an option). While we can Skype and most of my work can be done online, I am concerned that having no access to the department, not being able to attend seminars/workshops, and not being able to meet/talk to other students in person will put me at a big disadvantage.

I am keen not to spend these initial few months slacking off and want to catch any problems before it is too late. However, I have always found it difficult to judge my own progress when studying alone, and with a PhD it seems that it will be especially hard as I need to learn a lot of skills in a new area. Also, because my advisor seems like a very 'nice' person who does not demand that his students work very hard, I am concerned that he will not tell me if I am underperforming.

Would it be appropriate to raise this with my advisor, asking him to tell me if I am not doing as well as his students usually do? Or are there any strategies for people working from home to judge if they are doing enough?
","Yes, you should raise this issue, both with the advisor and with the university administration. Students need some feedback on their work and it is the university's responsibility to provide a way for that to happen. They need to provide the channels and you need to find a way to use them. 

But things are in a bit of chaos now, of course, and effective response can be slow to occur. 

Virtual seminars are possible using simple or sophisticated software. Perhaps you can set up (or the university can) a group of students and a professor or two willing to have an online session regularly. It isn't the same as face to face, but it can keep you engaged. 

But at a minimum, write a lot and note where you have problems. Ask a lot of questions, but make sure they are pretty focused. Share what you write with your advisor, by email or by posting it somewhere. 

Ask your advisor directly how you are doing and ask explicitly for next steps. You will most likely get suggestions about reading. Take a lot of notes on the readings and note things that puzzle you. Ask about them. 

If you are starting the research phase of the degree it is normally a fairly solitary effort in any case, but the advisor should be willing to review and respond to your efforts and your questions.

"There's a higher likelihood everyday that I am considering pursuing a PhD in my field, and ultimately, in applying for positions as a professor down the road. What I am trying to do is think ahead as to what some extra pieces of my application could include that are not research related. I understand that every field is different, but there are most likely numerous qualities and characteristics on an academic application that are not bound by discipline. So the question I would like to figure out is what type of professional development activities I can work on over the course of my PhD that would contribute to a well-rounded academic resume. 

Obviously, publications are key components in an application and over time those will (hopefully) manifest as research continues. What I am trying to do now is target other areas that will allow me to round out an application in the future. As an example, I am currently taking a Teaching &amp; Learning Program with the Graduate Studies department at my university and the program draws on the ""Science of Teaching and Learning"". In contrast to research papers, this type of thing may be minor, but I feel that developing these sort of auxiliary components to the overall application over time are all important. 

So pursuing development to become a better educator (and this is because I actually want to, not because I feel compelled to) is one thing that I can do in the present to help prepare me for the future. I am wondering what some other things can be done over time (especially over the course of a PhD), that can contribute to a strong application aside from research activities. Below is a list of some things that I have thought of that could be developed over the course of a PhD that could A) help a future application or at least B) make my life easier down the road (haha). 


Developing a sample of introductory course notes for in class &amp; online learning (boo COVID-19)
Pursuing professional development activities in teaching and learning
Developing introductions for certain technologies that have some relevance in my field, but can be overlooked at the undergraduate level (Programming Language or Geographic Information Systems)
Writing tips and advice for undergraduate students 


I debated asking this question, because it sort of feels like a shopping question, although after some thought it felt like more of a professional development question. 
","Actually the most important thing for you to focus on right now is getting a good research experience and a good relationship with an advisor. Get started on that. Learn to go deep into some subfield of your overall field. Gain expertise in that. 

Along the way, if you want to be an academic, a bit of teaching experience will help, but will be more valuable for some positions than others. But without the ""gain expertise"" part it won't matter much. 

And I caution against trying to choose a field strategically based on what is going on this month. You will graduate, in several years, into a completely different job situation and it is impossible to predict how it will go long in advance. As you get closer to graduation, in four years or so in the US, you can start to broaden your skill set depending on the perceived needs at that time. 

But some things are valuable in any case. Learning to do research. Learning to write. Learning to collaborate. Building a circle of potential collaborators.

But most of the details you suggest are just distractions at this time. Day 1 is the day you look seriously for the best advisor willing to work with you.

"I am currently an undergraduate student, and looking to apply to grad schools in the future. In response to COVID-19, my school is offering the ability between choosing the letter grade earned to appear on the transcript, or a pass if you earned over a C, for each individual class. 

I'm wondering if choosing the pass option for one of my classes would reflect poorly on grad school applications. The class in question is a not a major or graduation requirement, and it is 4 credits, so taking a B or lower would hurt my GPA. 

Thank you!
","
  The class in question is a not a major or graduation requirement


Assuming you want to go to graduate school in a topic closely related to your major, taking one unrelated course pass/fail will not matter under normal circumstances.  It will matter even less because everybody knows students are being encouraged to take classes pass/fail during the pandemic.

"I am sure this question has been asked in some capacity on this site. I am a first year graduate student. I was contracted for a summer program that would have looked very good on my CV about 6 weeks ago. 

However, due to the spread of COVID-19 the program was cancelled. Is there any way I can express this on my CV (possibly have an asterisk next to this activity)? If not, how should I explain the situation when applying for positions next year (because, now it is unlikely I will have anything noteworthy to put on my CV for this summer).

Thank you
","List it as an achievement.


  Awards and Achievements
  
  
  Selected for competitive summer program, Summer School on ABCDE. Scholarship awarded; attendance cancelled due to COVID-19.
  


I think this is completely appropriate, for the same reasons as argued on this related thread. Note: I added ""scholarhip awarded"", but obviously you should not put that if there was no scholarship :)

In general, the purpose of your CV is to brag as much as possible; include everything that sounds impressive, even if you personally don't think it's that impressive. For instance, if you got accepted to two programs and only could attend one, I would list both. It's the same thing here -- the fact that COVID-19 is the circumstance is just a detail, not relevant to whether the acceptance is appropriate to list.

"My u-GPA is about 2.8 and GRE is 330, from now on is a hypothetical scenario as I haven't done my masters yet so if you could treat it as an actual case and give me subjective answers that would be great. For the masters I have found this growing researcher who is doing amazing work and is eager for me to join his lab from the start of the program. Assuming that by the end of the MS, I get ~3.7GPA, a couple co-authored pub and 1 first authored pub in reputed journals along with going to conferences to present my work, altogether getting strong recommendations from the advisor and his colleagues. Will this in any way offset my u-GPA. Also apart from research in masters I have had about 2 years of research experience during undergrad (in and out of school) and have published a paper in a peer-reviewed journal. 

I am looking to get into the biomedical engineering PhD programs at university of chicago, northwestern university, university of pittsburgh, john hopkins university, york university, and university of pennsylvania. Do you think that I am aiming too high? If so, what else should I look to do to improve my chances? Also if I start MS this Fall should I apply for PhD at Fall 2022 or Fall 2023?

Additional Info:


I did a decent undergrad thesis (not great, 8 months), soon after I did a 2 month internship a another research lab. During my undergrad I worked w/ a prof for 1.2 years (Got two papers out - one in a conf and another in a journal). Currently I am working in a top research lab, now remotely due to covid-19 outbreak.
Some people have mentioned other questions thinking that those had the same information that I wanted. But, they did not as the questions talked about how to get into ""a/some"" PhD Program after a low U-GPA and maybe decent masters. The schools that I have mentioned above are ranked pretty high and  would appreciate if you could tailor your answers to my specific question of getting into these schools.
I picked these school not to show of the ""rank"" or ""prestige"" which seems stupid honestly. I chose the because of the strength in the field (F1) that I'm looking to do research in. In one of my previous questions I had mentioned that I got a PhD offer from university of houston which does the research in F1 but it isn't very strong in other area such as: number of grants that they pull in to do amazing research on large patient populations, intellectual cohorts, and industrial connections and startup resources. I picked these schools as I believe them to be the best in F1 and NOT for the main purpose of prestige. So if you don't have anything to suggest I IMPLORE you to not ask me to look at other schools as I did not ask for alternatives but solutions or ideas

","It is good to aim high. It is also good to have broad target. If you apply to only a few schools with very similar profiles then being rejected by one will probably have a similar outcome at the others. So, I recommend a range of schools if you really want a degree and not just bragging rights about a top 50 school. 

But, about your GPA. It isn't a plus, of course, but most (not all) people who evaluate your application will weight the more recent work as more important than the earlier work. Therefore, if your recent work is good and you have letters that attest to the quality of your work and your dedication, then the older numbers will be discounted by most. 

But, the competition is still very strong and the slots are few. If someone has to make a choice between two candidates, the choice has to be made and lower priority things may bear some weight. 

However, the only way to know whether you have a problem is to actually make application to some places and then evaluate the feedback. There are some questions, like this one, that can only be answered by actually trying. But, you will be more likely to get accepted somewhere if you don't target too narrowly.

"Disclaimer: My PhD supervisor, while not a bad person, is a bad mentor and has given me bad advice in the past. So discussing this with him isn't really productive. I have talked to other people in real life about this, and the opinion of this community would also be welcome.

I'm set to finish my PhD in theoretical physics in September 2020. I applied to several postdocs, got three interviews, and in one I was rated among the top choices but, in the end, I didn't secure any position.

I don't know how similar this is to the fields, but for context I'll explain how postdoc appointments work in (edit: high energy) theoretical physics. In my field, postdoc applications run in cycles. The majority have roughly the same application periods and deadlines (around November), most offers are made at the same time (early January following year) and they all start roughly at the same time (September). There's the occasional outlier, but that's the basic pattern. This means that it's more or less hopeless that I can continue looking for a position, ask professors, etc, for September 2020. If I wanted to stay in academia, I would need to look for a postdoc in the next cycle, starting September 2021.

I am unsure how realistic it is for me to try again or if I should simply throw the towel and quit academia.


First, there's the issue of staying one year academically idle (obviously not professionally idle, that would be insane). I could work on leftover projects from my PhD on my free time, but between finishing my PhD in September 2020 and the deadline for the next cycle on November 2020, that leaves very little time to do so. 
Second, how do I even explain the gap in my cover letter? If I flat out say I failed the previous application cycle, it's a guaranteed trip to the garbage can. Some people have recommended me just lying in vague terms, like I didn't pursue a postdoc immediately after completing my PhD due to ""health concerns that have since been resolved"". I'm unsure if this is a good idea...


If anyone has any other advice regarding my situation besides these two concerns I've raised, that would be welcome too. Basically, I would like to stay in academia as a first preference, but I have no desire to bang my head against the wall against something that, at this point, might be very close to impossible. I don't have any preference for country to work in, so feel free to give country-specific advice.
","1) First the bad news: The job situation (tenure track) in theoretical high energy physics is not good, covid will not help, having a hard time to get a first postdoc is not a good sign. Having difficulty to get a postdoc is probably not your fault. There are many possible reasons, such as field not a good match, advisor not helpful, institution not a good match. However, it is not clear that the situation will be different next year. 

2) In the past it has been quite uncommon for people to work in the private sector and then return to academia. If it is just a year then you can probably finish another paper or two from your graduate work, and describe your stint as gaining real world experience. I don't think it is true that people will just discard your application, but it does not improve it, either. 

3) The good news is that suddenly there does appear to be a new track. If you are interested in machine learning or quantum information then you can try to get a private sector job in this area, and that does leave open the possibility of returning to academia after you have gained some experience (after two years, for example, or even later than that).

"I have been waiting for my PhD thesis results for a long time now. Last week, I sent an email to the university, asking for the results.

Few hours ago, my supervisor has sent me an email saying that she got a notifications that the examiner reports were ready, and once I get the official email, I should contact her on how to respond to them. When I asked her if the results were ""OK or not""? She replied that she cannot disclose anything, but what she can say is that 


  ""the two examiners saw things very differently.....""


Now, those 'dots' at the end and the different views from examiners made me very stressed; Especially, since there is no one at the university to answer phones, because of the COVID-19! I have faced many problems during my PhD, such as my supervisors having problems with each other, my main supervisor resigning from the university, etc! And I just want this nightmare to be finished!

Does someone here knows if my supervisor's reply means there is a major problem with the thesis or not?

Thanks in advance!

PS: The reason I am shocked, is that despite almost not receiving any major feedback from my supervisors, I managed to publish a 'best paper' in a relatively good conference, based on my thesis. So, I was confident that it will not come back with very bad reviews!
Now, I am starting to read the sentence as 'both reviewers saw things differently from me and my supervisor'! Going crazy here! :))
","""Major problem"" is premature. ""Potential major problem"" though - that's likely, depending on what the examiners are disagreeing about. It's possible your thesis is fatally flawed, but it's also possible one of the examiners is wrong.

Either way you can't do anything right now, so there's nothing to do except wait for the official email.

"With travel restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic, many academics are organizing online seminars and conferences as a substitute for regular in-person university seminars, colloquia, and research conferences.  

In real life, seminars are usually open to anyone who wants to drop in, and every attendee can be seen and heard and may ask questions.  So an obvious approach is to organize the event using video meeting software such as Zoom, and simply post the link on a public website so that any interested person can participate.  However, this also opens the event to ""Zoom bombers"", random people who just want to disrupt the proceedings with annoying or offensive video / audio / text chat - such abuse has unfortunately become very common in public Zoom meetings.

What best practices exist to keep such an event as open as possible to legitimate participants, and let them interact with each other and the speaker in a reasonable way, while reducing the risk of disruption and abuse?

What are the pros and cons of these strategies?

Strategies could be general, or involve specific features of certain software.

Some strategies I've thought of, and their drawbacks:


Create a password for the meeting.  Then the question is, to whom should the organizer give the password?  If they only give it to people they know, it excludes people who might be interested but whom they happen not to know.  If they distribute it to large mailing lists of interested academics, it raises the chance that it will fall into the wrong hands.
Offer to share the password by email upon request.  This requires extra time from the organizer to respond to those emails, and to manually verify the credentials of each requester.
Require a nominal registration fee, as real-life conferences often do.  This requires setting up an online payment system, which can be a lot of work, and may exclude people who are only casually interested, or who don't have funding, or who work in less wealthy parts of the world.  It may also involve the organizer in a lot of bureaucracy with their university as to how the fees will be managed and spent.
Use a ""waiting room"" feature, where participants must be approved immediately before joining.  However, as far as I know, the host only sees the participant's name.  If they see an unfamiliar name, how can they tell whether it is a troll, or a legitimate researcher whom they just happen not to know?  Conversely, I don't think there is anything to stop a troll from masquerading under the name of a famous academic.


I am wondering if people have thought of better solutions, that are specifically appropriate to academia.  Such strategies might take advantage of specific features of the academic community, e.g. to authenticate genuine researchers (.edu addresses? accounts on preprint servers? ORCid IDs?).  Answers could also address the pros and cons of such strategies as they apply to academia in particular, and how well they fit with people's existing expectations for academic conferences.
","How about using something other than Zoom? Other softwares support features that can help with this. Moreover there are some serious security and privacy concerns about Zoom (see e.g. this statement by the FBI and this investigation by the NY attorney general; Bruce Schneier has written an overview of the concerns here).

In our department we use BigBlueButton (website, Wikipedia) for our classrooms and seminars. It's a completely open-source and free web conferencing system. There are a few services out there that host servers but they're completely overloaded at the moment. I'd say your best bet would be to get your IT services to host a server for your department. With BBB by default new users don't have their webcams activated, and you can prevent them from doing so. You can even prevent them from using their microphone and require them to virtually ""raise their hand"" before a moderator allows them to speak. That should cut down a lot of the abuse. You can also set up the service so that an account is required before accessing the meeting. Unless the abuser is very dedicated, they probably won't bother creating dozens of accounts to continue bothering people after being kicked out, I hope.

Also, something obvious: many abusers are specifically targeting Zoom and going into random Zoom meetings. Unless you've somehow attracted abusers who are specifically targeting you, if you use something else (especially something hosted by your own department), you probably won't have any problems.

Note: I'm only recommending BBB because that's what we use at our department, but there are other services out there. I know another department has set up something called ""Panopto"" for example, and another something called ""Classilio"" - you'll have to look that up, I don't know much about it. For informal meetings we use Jitsi but it doesn't seem adequate for hosting a seminar. But in any case, if a software doesn't meet your requirements, you should definitely look into switching to something else, especially with the privacy concerns...

"I was flying from Canada back home, after all the in-person classes and tests were canceled.
So my country(Kazakhstan) has strict laws that were enforced in regard of the new pandemic. They include closing a passenger of an international flight coming in to Kazakhstan in a quarantine hospital.
In my case there was only 1 city that had a working airport in the country, my only resort was going there and later traveling to my city.
The whole process took place in a prisoner-like environment in which i was held for 4 days. By my release from the first city, i was already late on one of my assignments, and by the time I actually got home in my city, but without luggage and got back to relatively normal state, i was late on the second one.
My question is, should I be contacting my professor about this messed up situation, or should i consider something else. Im asking this because the missed assignments could make me fail the course.
","There will be some flexibility for the assignment(s) due around the closing / travel / quarantine times - all you have to do is talk to your professor.

"A few years ago we wanted to open a new program that will be based on distance learning,  however, getting accredited for having a master degree program that is based on distance learning and not on campus is literally a bureaucratic nightmare.
First, no one allowed us to use Zoom, Microsoft Teams or other currently popular distance learning tools, second it should be some sort of  ""Moodle"" program with clear guidelines for each week. Third everything needs to be under guidelines of the Distance Education Accrediting Commission, in current COVID19 teaching organizational crisis we don't follow those guidelines at all.
I wonder what are legal repercussions for doing distance learning when you are not accredited to do one. Can our students with disability complain since when they needed this option we couldn't provide to them since our excuse was that we weren't ready or accredited to do so? And last but not least, can we legally organize accredited on-campus program but perform it online or using distance learning completely?
","Edit: this answer is somewhat specific to the context of the COVID-19 health crisis and about legal justifications for various exceptional teaching strategies being adopted by many universities all over the world these days. It’s not clear if that’s what you meant to ask about exactly. If it’s not, please clarify.



The COVID-19 situation and the way universities are responding to it is an illustration of the adage that “it is easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission”. Basically the situation is so unprecedented that universities are doing whatever they can to stay operational, and leaving legal questions for later. My guess is that these will all be addressed by governments, legislatures, and regulatory bodies at a later time when the people in charge emerge out of panic mode and have time for dealing with such issues.

At the same time, the question of legality is indeed significant, and people are in fact paying attention. For example, in the US, I have heard that the visas of many foreign students explicitly forbid “online learning”. As a result, I have also heard (this is basically gossip and I can’t confirm it or cite a reference) that some institutions are referring to their current mode of operation as “remote learning” in a euphemistic attempt to pretend that that’s conceptually different from “online learning”. Silly? Perhaps, but that’s the kind of advice lawyers are giving apparently. Similar fig-leaf, CYA-style advice is being given about protecting your Zoom class meeting with a password to avoid being accused of compromising your students’ privacy. Does that mean using Zoom is technically legal in the sense of being fully FERPA-compliant? Who knows - probably not. But at least we make an effort to minimize whatever legal issues we have time to think about and energy to do something about.

But the short answer is, in the academic context as well as other contexts having to do with civil liberties, restrictions on people’s movements and many other aspects of our daily lives that are being disrupted, the law is lagging far behind. People in charge will do whatever they need to do without asking for permission, and ask for forgiveness later if they have to (they probably won’t).

"I'm an undergraduate in the US.

My professor just told us via email that he will not be able to grade an exam until next week because his family member died from complications due to COVID-19. I don't care much about the delay, but I do like my professor, both as a person and an educator. Would it be out of line for me to send an email along the lines of ""Hi professor, I'm sorry to hear your loved one passed.""

I'm not a very socially outgoing person and I don't speak up in class much, so I don't know if this would overstep the student-professor relationship.

"We cannot take photos of protons because they are not at least the size of the wavelength that registers into visible light. I see photos of Coronavirus in the news everywhere where there is a clear distinctive gray ball with red petal shown in such great details. How is that photo taken? Is that just an artistic impression or a real photo?
","Pictures like this can be taken with an electron microscope, where the effective wavelength of the illuminating beam is far shorter than that of visible light. Those pictures are in black &amp; white only (electrons don't have ""color"") but are then color-coded with tools like photoshop to highlight particular structures on their surfaces. 

Furthermore, once the exact structure of the protein molecules that form the virus has been figured out, molecular biologists can then apply computer models to the protein structures and determine with great accuracy how they fold together and interlock to create a complete virus particle. 

Those modeled structures can then be color-coded as well, again in the interest of highlighting where the different protein molecules are located and how they project out from the surface of the protein. 

The pictures you see of ball-shaped virus particles with lumpy, colored knobs studding their surfaces were prepared in this way. 
"
"I was thinking about this problem when I searched up how warm it takes to kill the new coronavirus. A source said 132 fahrenheit for 30 minutes. I wanted to calculate how much energy that would take so then I could easily find out how long I would have to microwave an object to get the same results.

All I want is just how much energy is put into maintaining this 132 fahrenheit for half an hour at a room temperature. A formula would be fine because I want to be able to apply this to other problems that might come up.
","The amount of energy required to maintain water at some temperature over some time is simply equal to the amount of energy that the water loses to the environment over that time.

It depends on the conditions that the water is in, specifically how much heat the water is losing the environment. For example, it will take more energy to maintain water at 132 F when you place it in a cold windy environment because it's losing lots of heat in that environment.

So let's say you have a simple scenario of a pot of water sitting in room temperature. A simple energy balance on your water gives:

$$ q_{in} = hA_s(T-T_0) $$

Where $q_{in}$ is the input power, $h$ is an effective heat transfer coefficient telling how much heat the water loses to the ambient (typical value of 5-10 $W/m^2K$ for a 56 C object sitting in a room with no wind), $A_s$ is the surface area of your water container, $T$ is the temperature of the water (56 C), and $T_0$ is room temperature (25 C).

So, all you need is the surface area of your water container. Then solve for the required power $q_in$, and multiply by time (30 min) to get the required energy.

$$ Q_{in} = tq_{in} $$ 

Where $t$ is the time you desire (30 min). That's how you do it. 
"
"I have been studying the Feynman path integral and its various derivations, and I've run into a bit of a problem. The standard Feynman path integral appears as follows:
$$
\int \mathcal{D}[x(t)]\exp\left(\frac i \hbar \int_0^t d\tau\ \left( \frac m2 \dot{x}(\tau) - V(x(\tau) \right) \right)
$$
Where the path integral is defined by passing the following into the continuum limit:
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty}\idotsint d^{n-1}x\ \mathcal{N} \exp\left( \frac i \hbar \sum_{j=1}^n \left( \frac m2 \left( \frac{x_{j+1} - x_j}{\Delta t} \right)^2 - V(x_j) \right) \Delta t \right)
$$ 
where $\Delta t = t/n$. In this form, we independently integrate each $x_j$ from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$, and hence there is no innate notion that the paths considered must be continuous; $x_{j+1}$ and $x_j$ can be as far apart as we please. 

In doing readings, I have found multiple sources that claim that the paths we consider are continuous, for example in this paper. In transforming to imaginary time ($-t \to -i\tau$), this claim makes sense, since discontinuities in the path will blow up the the sum and they will be exponentially suppressed. However, in the form presented above, I am not quite sure where and how we can make this claim.

I have seen the argument that paths that deviate greatly from the classical path will lead to extreme oscillatory behavior from our phase, and hence will be suppressed since they will on-average integrate to zero. However, I don't think I am satisfied with this argument to claim we must have continuity. This shows which paths contribute the most, but I don't think it rules out discontinuous paths. Does anyone have insight into this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
","The paths of a Feynman integral do not always have to be continuous, and the first example that comes to my mind is the Feynman integral in the Feynman-Vernon formalism, which is used to study the spin-boson model, among other things.

For the spin-boson problem, the $x(t)$ paths written in your question, are discontinuous. If the spin in your spin-boson problem is a spin-1/2 particle, then $x(t)$ will be either -1/2 or +1/2 at each time $t$, and the Feynman integral will be over all possible paths, of which I'll give four examples below: 


$x(t)$ = -1/2 for all $t$.
$x(t)$ = +1/2 for all $t$.
$x(t)$ = -1/2 from $t=0$ to $t$=5ps, and $x(t)$=+1/2 for the rest of the time.
$x(t)$ = -1/2 from $t=0$ to $t$=5ps, $x(t)$=+1/2 from $t$=5ps to $t$=10ps, then $x(t)$=-1/2 for the rest of the time.


If you allow all possible flips between spin-up and spin-down between $t=0$ and the rest of your desired time for the Feynman integral, there will be an infinite number of such paths. 

The software FeynDyn (Feynman Dynamics) can calculation such Feynman integrals for up to 16 spin-1/2 particles (or 16 qubits, if simulating a quantum computer in the presence of noise) and more information about this whole ""Feynman-Vernon"" formalism can be found in this paper (I have given a free link to the PDF rather than the original journal, in case COVID lockdown has caused you not to be on a campus where you can download papers easily).

"In the abstract of this paper Authors said in abstract of that paper entitled Simulation of the AC corona phenomenon with experimental validation : 

"".....,This phenomenon is also associated with components used in the power industry where it is, in many cases, the source of electro-magnetic disturbance, noise and production of undesired chemically active species"" , Now my question here is : Is there any connection between this topic AC Corona and Corona virus since AC corona produce undesired chemically active species ? In my Guess according to the contenent of the titled paper this Coronaviruse is a human production not come randomly from nature ?

Edit:  What they meant by  production of undesired chemically active species ? Does this meant from AC corona we may produce undesired chemically species which means a such virus derived from AC coron ?
","""Corona"" is Latin for ""crown."" It is used the names of many unrelated objects.

A ""corona virus"" has a layer of spiky proteins around its surface, so it looks like a crown under an electron microscope.

An electrical coronal discharge happens when the electric field near an object is high enough to ionize the air; it makes a spiky glow that looks kind of like a crown. The ionized air molecules can participate in chemical reactions that aren't available to neutral air molecules, and that chemistry is a factor in the aging of high-voltage electrical systems.

In your abstract they write that most modeling of coronal discharges are of direct-current discharges, while they focus on alternating- current (AC) discharges.  For an example of the difference between anode and cathode chemistry, see this post.

"I have seen websites and videos that show how cancer cells can be destroyed using sound resonance oscillation. So has anyone heard of anyone who is in the field of sound resonance trying to capture the wavelength of the Corona virus so we can create a Sonogram machine to use against this virus pandemic?
","It's a nice idea. Sadly it won't work but there is still some interesting physics involved.

As a general rule resonance is only an efficient way to transfer energy to an object if that object has a high Q factor. A high Q factor means the energy supplied builds up and increases the amplitude of the oscillation, and this may get large enough to damage the object. This is the (alleged) mechanism for the shattering of wine glasses by overenthusiastic sopranos. Wine glasses have a high Q and you can tell this by the way they ring for a while when you tap them. As a contrast, potatoes have a low Q and do not ring when you tap them. So our sopranos would have a hard time shattering a potato.

The problem with using ultrasound to kill cells or viruses is that in general they are squishy low Q objects like potatoes, not high Q objects like wine glasses, and they do not store the energy of the sound efficiently enough for the amplitude of oscillation to build up to destructive levels. So the technique simply won't work.

Ultrasound is used to kill tumours, but this does not work by resonance - the energy in the sound simply heats the cancer tissue and kills it. It is used for tumours because the sound can be focused onto the tumour where it causes local heating. This would not work for viral infections since the virus is distributed throughout the body not concentrated in one area onto which the sound can be targeted.

Even if viruses were brittle like glass it would still be hard to make them resonate enough to be damaged when they are in a fluid like water. There are two reasons for this.

Firstly water is much denser and much more viscous than air so it efficiently damps the vibrations of any objects moving in it. For example if you tap a glass underwater it will not ring as it does in air. So even objects that have a high Q factor in air will have a drastically lower Q factor in water. This applies to viruses in humans since as far as sound waves are concerned human tissue is little different from water.

Secondly sound waves are a compression wave and they propagate by alternately compressing and expanding the water. The amount the water compresses and stretches is determined by the bulk modulus and this is relatively high. That means the amplitude of the wave is small unless the energy is very high, and consequently the mechanical deformation of objects in the water by the wave is small. This makes it hard to deform the virus enough to damage it.

"I have observed a strange phenomenon. I my mouth is very sensitive to very hot liquids (like, freshly made tea, or just freshly boiled water), so when I make my tea, I usually wait around 20 minutes before drinking it.

I am also a fan of a particular 3 in 1 instant coffee (3 in 1 meaning instant coffe + instant milk + sugar). I am taking one pack of mentioned coffee (21 grams in one package), pouring it with with freshly boiled water, mixing the coffee with water using a teaspoon in room-temperatured cup, then I am going to the toilet for ~5-7 minutes. When I come back from the toilet, my coffee is ready to drink. It is hottish, but I can drink it right away.

Later on (2-3 hours later), I am making a cup of tea, using the same cup, which is in the room temperature again. I am pouring two teabags (4 grams of tea) with the same amount of freshly boiled water, and I make my breakfast. It usually takes me around 10 minutes to make my breakfast, and when I am trying to drink my tea right after finishing making by breakfast, it is still hot as hell. I am usually waiting another 10 minutes, then the tea is still hotter than the coffee after 7 minutes, but it starts being acceptable for my sensitive mouth.

I have even bought a food thermometer to check the cooling speed of both liquids, but because of the coronavirus outbreak it hasn't arrived yet, but my ""internal"" thermometer - my lips, and isides of my mouth cannot be wrong. I can drink the coffee after ~7 minutes, and the tea after ~20.

I would understand a little change in cooling time, cause we are talking about 21 grams of instant coffee-sugar-powdered mix, the liquid is a bit densier, maybe there is more energy used to dissolve the coffee ingredients, the instant milk contains fat, but still - i am talking here about 13 minutes of difference between the time when my mouth can accept the temperature of both liquids, and we have to remember that the tea is still a hotter 20 minutes after I pour it with boiling water than the coffee 7 minutes, but it is drinkable.

Is there an explaination for this?
","I can think of two possible differences which might contribute this result, but I am not sure how you could test them. The different composition of the drinks will affect the surface tension. This could affect the rate of evaporation of the liquid. If this is the case, it may make a substantial difference to the rate of cooling as evaporation is probably the greatest cause of loss of temperature.

The other cooling effect which will be different is radiation. Do you add milk to your tea? If the coffee is darker than the tea, it will radiate faster and cool faster for that reason. 

If you don't add milk, the tea will be translucent. I am not exactly sure how that will affect things, because it means that radiation is possible from the interior, not just the surface. Also it may not be translucent for the wavelengths radiated. But generally, I think a translucent substance will radiate much less. 
"
"Not an economist by far, just a layman, and that's a layman question.

How is this possible that it's difficult to find mask for the Corona Virus? I have been several times to 7/11, boots, Watson, and other pharmacies, and everytime they did not have it as they ran out. How is it possible that the producers of masks give up on additional earning by not producing more masks, now that it's pretty obvious the demand is going up?

The fact that there are not enough masks is my personal experience in Bangkok - however, some friends of mine have the same experience in Italy, where the Corona Virus outbreak has reached a scary stage.

Generally. I would explain capitalism failure by pointing at government regulations - however in this case I don't see how the government can be involved into mask production. 
Any idea? 
","This is a common problem in many domains. For example, there's massive new demand of Airbus planes after the Boeing 737 Max 8 disaster, and their manufacturing capacity is maxed out.

I'm familiar with it from the domain of software development, so I'll use that as an example.

Suppose some website gets mentioned on Reddit and the post happens to hit the first page. It gets the ""Reddit hug of death"" (the swarm of reddit users overwhelm the website's servers, and it becomes unavailable). You could ask the same question:


  How is it possible that the producers of [this site] give up on additional earning by not [spinning up more servers], now that it's pretty obvious the demand is going up?


If that ""additional earning"" (of having more of your product available to provide) is less than it costs to permanently over-provision a resource (web servers, mask production factories, etc.), then it's not economical to do so.

Cloud infrastructure is becoming incredibly liquid, because resources are very flexible and can be pooled. A high traffic day for my website might be a low traffic day for yours. A cloud provider could scale down your site (saving you money) by uninstalling your software from a server, reassigning that server to me, and use it to scale up my site by installing my software on it (raising my infrastructure costs, but also raising my business' income because it hasn't gone down). There are even auto-scaling systems that can scale your service up and down in response to current load. There's still some lead time, on the order of a few minutes for web server virtual machines.

The real world is much less flexible than software. If masks are in hot demand, but construction helmets aren't, you can't re-purpose the injection molds for hard hats into face-mask stitching machines. There are many factors involved in deciding whether or not its worth in investing to grow the mask manufacturing business:


How many masks are available in reserve? In the warehouses of factories and distributors, in hospitals, in military bases, etc.
How long do we think this epidemic will last? Will it last long enough to deplete the reserves? Is it long-term enough to justify the high up front expenses?
How much marginal profit is there to be made in selling these extra masks?


Interestingly, this problem repeats itself and plays itself out upstream in the supply chain. Are the companies that make mask-stitching machines able to produce enough for the new demand? What about their upstream supply chain?
"
"I'm trying to understand this r/explainlikeimfive analogy. I rectified typos, and simplified some  names and numbers. 


Won't Cal demand  his principal back at some time in the future? 
Similarly, won't countries' sovereign debts demand their principal? 
For example, China holds much US treasuries and US sovereign debt. If China thinks COVID-2019 will cripple the US and wants to park its money else where, won't China demand all of its principal from the US so that it can buy Australia or New Zealand sovereign debt instead? 



  'Country A owes \$10  to country B, and has agreed to pay 2% interest annually. Call this Debt X.
  
  Country B owes \$15  to country A, and has agreed to pay 1% interest annually. This is Debt Y.
  
  Investor A is willing to purchase Debt X for \$12, because he values the steady rate of return, and believes country A is very likely to pay its debts. He isn't as sure about Debt Y, but he is willing to pay \$16 for it. Investor B thinks that investor A is going to change his mind about Debt Y and value it more highly, so he is willing to pay \$17 for it today.
  
  Debt is traded constantly and it's valued differently. Just because 2 countries owe each other similar amounts of money, doesn't mean the value cancels out in any meaningful way.
  
  Think of debt this way. You and your three brothers all own a house together. Each year you take up a collection of \$1000 a head for \$~4k annual upkeep on the house. One year, a tree falls on the roof, and the house needs another \$4000 bucks. Everyone could just chip in 1k each, but one brother is having a tough year, so instead, you loan the house \$4k, with the expectation that it will pay you 1% interest a year.
  
  Your brothers agree, and over the years, this comes up a few more times. You even use debt to finance installing a new hottub. You now own \$20k in debt from the house, 1 brother owns \$5k, and for some weird reason, your neighbor Cal wants to purchase the debt from you. (He really thinks your household is trustworthy, and wants somewhere to park \$20k for 1% interest).
  
  Now C owns \$20k of debt from your house, so C owns 80% of all your house's debt. Would you say C owns your house now? Well of course not, your house is likely worth many times more what C has claim to. If someone in your house is super worried about the situation, they could take up a collection in the house to buy the debt back from C, but it's not a popular idea, because most people can think of better things to do with their money than pay off C so they don't have to make the small yearly interest payments.

","
The principal has to be repaid eventually but with majority of formal debt instruments such as government bonds the creditor can’t just demand repayment whenever he or she wants. Most debt instruments have pre-specified date and if not date then conditions when and how the principal is being paid back.


For example a standard 10year bond will pay its principal in 10 years not a day earlier (unless you actually manage to convince the debtor to voluntary agree to pay it sooner).


The above works for sovereign countries too. A 10 year government bond will have on it printed that principal is payed back exactly after 10years. 


Now this is outside economics, but technically sovereign nations are in state of anarchy so I can imagine one country could just decide to say to another pay now or we will invade you/nuke you etc. but aside of some military intervention there is no way of legally forcing the country to pay.

In fact any government can, in principle, default on its debts anytime it wants. The only constraint on sovereign default is that if you constantly default on your debt nobody will want to lend you money in the future, or if only at punitively high interest. Hence on sovereign level governments as debtors have much better bargaining power than just individuals.

Government can be forced to pay its debt only through military action, or in some cases by diplomatic pressure (for example EU could threaten Greece by revoking its euro-zone or EU membership, US could threaten countries by economic sanctions etc.). Aside from that there is nothing other country can do to get its money back if debtor nation says no.


Based on 1, and 2 you probably already know the answer. No that’s not possible. China could patiently wait for bonds to expire and then not buy new US bonds but instead buy Australian or New Zeeland bonds. Of course, since there is a lot of debt being issued by US government probably every month there are bonds expiring and being replaced by new ones so China could start do it sooner than later.


Also beside of that, usually when people want to get rid of a debt they won’t wait for maturity and for repayment of the principal. They will take the bond to bond market and sell it at market price to get money now. That creates a trouble for country in a sense that now it has to set lower price or higher interest on its newly issued bonds due to increased supply, but whether this becomes a problem depends on plethora of factors many unrelated to the original debtor and creditor countries, such as how big is the demand for the debtors bonds etc.

"People are concerned about the economic impacts of the virus. How severe will the economic downturn be? Will the coronavirus cause a global recession worse than the 2008 crisis?
I'm not looking here for speculative answers, but references with a solid economic background. For example, I found these:


Flattening the Pandemic and Recession Curves, March 13 2020, by Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Berkeley.
Economics in the Time of Covid-19, by Vox CEPR.


Any other (academic) references?



Economics podcasts are also welcome. I found those:


Russ Roberts and Tyler Cowen on COVID-19
The Side Effects of Social Distancing by Freakeconomics
And a bunch of recent episodes by Planet Money.




Update.

Some nice references on Following the economic impact of COVID-19 by Stanford (SIEPR) experts.
","With the right keywords (and author searches) from earlier papers, I actually found some academic output already; this might not be peer-reviewed yet, i.e. preprints:


McKibbin and Fernando (2 March 2020) The Global Macroeconomic Impacts of COVID-19: Seven Scenarios


  examines the impacts of different scenarios on macroeconomic outcomes and
  financial markets in a global hybrid DSGE/CGE general equilibrium model.
  The scenarios in this paper demonstrate that even a contained outbreak could significantly
  impact the global economy in the short run. [...]
  These results are very sensitive to the assumptions in the model, to the shocks we feed in and
  to the assumed macroeconomic policy responses in each country.

And that's already cited by Wang et al. COVID-19's Impact on China's Economy Based on Data of Spring Festival Travel Rush


  this paper starts with the analysis of the daily railway passenger volume data during the Spring Festival travel rush, and establishes three time series to model the railway passenger volume, GDP in the first quarter model, and GDP in the last three quarters respectively. The forecast results indicate that: (a) Affected by the epidemic, China’s economy will lose 4.8 trillion yuan in the first quarter of 2020, which is an expected decrease of 20.69% and a year-on-year drop of 15.60%; (b) China's expected GDP growth rate for the full year of 2020 will reduce from 6.50% to 1.72%. However, there are some positive factors not taken into account in these models, which means that the forecast results may be underestimated. With the global spread of the epidemic, the instability of the world economy will in turn impact China’s economy.

A more recent (March 30) paper, Greenstone and Nigam that emphasizes/quantifies the benefits of the lockdowns, in the US:


  Using the Ferguson et al. (2020) simulation model of COVID-19’s spread and mortality impacts in the United States, we project that 3-4 months of moderate distancing beginning in late March 2020 would save 1.7 million lives by October 1. Of the lives saved, 630,000 are due to avoided overwhelming of hospital intensive care units. Using the projected age-specific reductions in death and age-varying estimates of the United States Government’s value of a statistical life, we find that the mortality benefits of social distancing are about \$8 trillion or $60,000 per US household. Roughly 90% of the monetized benefits are projected to accrue to people age 50 or older. Overall, the analysis suggests that social distancing initiatives and policies in response to the COVID-19 epidemic have substantial economic benefits.





JP Morgan has put out some estimates already, although they don't detail their methodology as much as a peer-reviewed publication would (have to).


  The U.S. economy is projected to contract by 14% in the second quarter, after experiencing a 4% contraction in the first quarter, before recovering to 8% and 4% growth in the third and fourth quarters. Euro area GDP will suffer an even deeper contraction, with double-digit declines of 15% and 22% in the first and second quarters, before rebounding by 45% and 3.5% in the third and fourth quarters.
  
  “There is no longer doubt that the longest global expansion on record will end this quarter. We now think that the COVID-19 shock will produce a global recession, as nearly all of the world contracts over the three months between February and April,” said Bruce Kasman, Chief Economist at J.P. Morgan. Initially, the expectation was the novel-recession may generate limited labor market damage, but J.P. Morgan Research is now forecasting the unemployment rate for developed markets as a whole will rise 1.6 percentage points in the next two quarters.
  
  “The rise in unemployment will be sharper in the U.S. than in the Euro area. Most immediately, U.S. initial jobless claims should spike above 400,000 in the coming weeks,” said Michael Feroli, Chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan.


McKinsey has a somewhat spread-out (March 25) presentation, but a couple of slides with their scenarios/estimates I could fish from there:




Likewise, PWC has a March [white]paper mostly focused on Australia... but which does come with a global map attached of their estimates of GDP losses, alas in absolute figures only (and I think over one year based on what they say on the previous slide):





Before the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a niche academic domain of estimating the economic impact of pandemics already, typically using a CGE model. Results depend of course on the assumptions used. E.g. Smith, Keogh-Brown et al. had a series of papers approximately a decade ago. Quoting from a later one that covered more than one European country:


  Results suggest GDP losses from the disease of approximately 0.5–2% but school closure and prophylactic absenteeism more than triples these effects.


So they went as high ~10% GDP losses. While they did not envisage government mandated lockdown(s), they modelled ""prophylactic absenteeism"" in response to ~3% death rate media reports as the most severe case. An earlier paper of theirs, on UK only is open-access in the BMJ. Quoting their assumption from there


  almost everybody in the population will know someone who has died once the mortality rate reaches one death per 300 people, triggering prophylactic absenteeism.


The same authors (Keogh-Brown and Smith) also published in 2008 a fairly detailed post-hoc account of how economic predictions for SARS fared in hindsight... which generally wasn't all that good, meaning that most models overestimated the economic impact of SARS. It cites positively an 2003 ADB paper of Fan that hedged its bets on two different scenarios (early containment being one of them).

Another paper Verikios et al. (2015) in a similar vein but attempts a global estimate (GTAP CGE), and also discussed prior/related work:


  The two pandemic scenarios modelled give quantitatively and qualitatively different
  results. [...] Our results show that the peak GDP effects on the world economy of an influenza pandemic are in the range 0.06 to 1.01 per cent in the peak year depending on the nature of the pandemic. Our results are smaller than the only previous estimates of the global economic effects of influenza pandemics by McKibbin and Sidorenko (2006). They estimate reductions in global GDP of between 0.8 and 12.6 per cent depending on the severity of the pandemic. Our results are not directly comparable to McKibbin and Sidorenko as they did not model a continuum of pandemic scenarios across the virulence-infectiousness continuum. Rather, they assume a given reproducibility of the virus (infectiousness) and vary virulence across their four scenarios. Further, they implicitly assume multiple waves for all their scenarios as they presume that
  new infections continue to occur for greater than one year. This is likely to characterise only more extreme pandemics (such as the 1918–19 flu) rather than milder pandemics. Differences in the range of influenza pandemics modelled by us and McKibbin and Sidorenko are justifiable given the uncertain nature of future pandemics. Our results thus build upon the findings of McKibbin and Sidorenko by extending the estimation of potential GDP estimates over a further range of potential pandemic threat scenarios.
  
  [...] Our results show that the global macroeconomic effects of an influenza pandemic may be significant but are also likely to be short-lived. The largest economic impacts of an influenza pandemic are driven by reduced international tourism, due to risk-modifying measures by households and travel restrictions imposed by health authorities, and lost workdays, due to illness or formal social distancing measures designed to contain the virus. This is consistent with the work of Keogh-Brown et al. (2009, 2010). [...] 


Verikios seems to work for KPMG Australia nowadays and they have released a COVID-19 model that is fairly detailed in explaining its assumptions, for example it has separate pre- and post-stimulus arms/scenarios, but it mostly covers the Australian case, in particular only models the government response of that country.

KPMG uses a NiGEM (New-Keynesian) macro model, and they've basically tweaked some parameters of this using estimates of shocks in four areas: reduction in productivity due to additional sick leave by workers, reduction in productivity due to additional carer’s leave by workers, incremental investment premium, capacity utilisation adjustment (i.e. supply chain disruptions). The first two were informed by fairly detailed labour &amp; health statistics, the latter two seem a bit more arbitrary to me, e.g. they added a flat 1% investment premium.



I was hoping the IMF would have something more concrete than this, but I guess
they are weary of advancing anything more detailed yet:


  The COVID-19 pandemic would cause a global recession in 2020 that could be worse than the one triggered by the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, but world economic output should recover in 2021, the IMF said on Monday.
  
  Georgieva issued the new outlook after a conference call of G20 finance ministers and central bankers, who she said agreed on the need for solidarity across the globe. [...]
  
  The outlook for global growth is negative and the IMF expects “a recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis, or worse,” Georgieva said.
  
  Earlier this month, Georgieva had warned that 2020 world growth would be below last year’s 2.9 percent rate, but stopped short of predicting a recession.
  
  Georgieva on Monday said that a recovery is expected in 2021, but to reach it, countries would need to prioritize containment and strengthen health systems.
  
  “The economic impact is and will be severe, but the faster the virus stops, the quicker and stronger the recovery will be,” she said.


The CBO has now posted its own assessment for the US economy. It disclaims that it is ""highly uncertain, especially for later periods"", but basically, for the second quarter of 2020 it predicts 10 percent unemployment and the economy to contract by ""more than"" 7 percent.

The WTO Secretariat has posted this self-explanatory chart on April 8:


"
"UK government promises to pay 80% of wages for people unemployed due to coronavirus. I am not economist, so I am probably missing something, but shouldn’t paying wages to unemployed due to coronavirus result in inflation due to decreased products and services created by economy? Is that just a mechanism to redistribute wealth?
","Not by itself. The inflation generally depends on the following monetary relation:

$$ MV =PY$$

Where M is money supply, V velocity of money (how much one buck is used in economy), P is the price level (change in which is inflation), and Y is a real output.

Now solving for P so we can focus on inflation gives us:

$$P=\frac{MV}{Y}$$

Hence price level (and consequently) increases when money supply increases, velocity of money increases or output decreases.

Now let’s analyze giving money to those unemployed.


Is it newly created money? If not then money supply won’t increase. If yes then it would increase inflation rate.
Redistribution generally does not affect velocity of money much so we can skip that.
Does this change the output Y? Well not by much those people are already unemployed. If anything it could increase Y as unemployed have probably high marginal propensity to consume so in short run redistribution from a richer person with lower marginal propensity to consume will increase Y. Especially if this spending was not paid out of higher taxes but from debt.


So a priori as long as it’s not financed through printing new money it should not really have effect on inflation. Inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon.

Also, yes it’s a redistribution mechanism like most of the things that UK government does. Any policy that uses government funds as a transfer to others, or fund non-public good services (like NHS for example) is a redistributive measure.

"Pls ELI5. 2013 was last time I opened macroeconomics textbook! I just have a B.A. economics.

On r/Economics, u/ComfortableCold9 asked


  From your point of view, at what point would we [the USA in 2020] be approaching weimar? A QE program of 15 trillion? 25 trillion?


Right under, u/Bumblewurth answered


  From my point of view, never. What made hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic and (most other regimes with hyperinflation) was printing marks to pay debts in gold. The whole point of QE is to provide liquidity (already there) and to prevent deflation/meet inflation targets (not there yet.) If we're at QE with 25 trillion it's because we still haven't seen inflation in consumer prices.
  
  Inequality will be through the roof though as asset prices inflate.


u/Bumblewurth answers u/ComfortableCold9's follow-ups quoted in line.


  
    [u/ComfortableCold9 :] So seeing as we pay our debts in dollar, that suggests to me that we are effectively reliant on the dollar maintaining its strength
  
  
  [u/Bumblewurth :] No we aren't. If the dollar falls, the debts fall with the dollar. That's the difference between hyperinflationary economies in the past with non-sovereign debt and modern economies with sovereign debt. You aren't printing more dollars to chase the same amount of gold.
  
  
    But as soon as we start to see a level of inflation that would warrant a massive QT program, the economy would be held hostage.
  
  
  Economy is held hostage with deflation risk already. There's risk everywhere. That's life. But QE won't cause hyperinflation, just a whole lot of asset inflation and inequality.
  
  Most of this could be avoided if we weren't so tepid about using fiscal policy or if the fed had a fiscal tool to just send checks to everyone to manage deflation. Monetary policy is pushing on a string. But congress won't act, so here we are; Just like in 2008.



Like u/ComfortableCold9 below, I too ""don't see a difference""? 
I don't understand Bumblewurth's distinction between ""future obligations"" and ""current debts"". ""Current debts are wiped out when you monetize them"" — So what? 



  
    [u/ComfortableCold9 :] I don't see a difference here; if the dollar started to lose lose strength, you would have to print more dollars to get the same value of what you're buying.
  
  
  Yes, that's a concern for future obligations, not current debts. Current debts are wiped out when you monetize them. But once you get inflation you stop QE because the entire point of QE is to create inflation so that demand is at productive capacity. You aren't printing money to cover obligations and then printing ever more to cover the same obligations as your currency falls. You're printing more to prevent deflation. That's the point. QE and Weimar aren't related.

","If you want something ""even more ELI5"", try this from the Atlantic:


  Let me unpack these one by one. Right now getting the markets to buy our debt isn't the problem. Getting enough debt for the markets to buy is the problem. Investors are so crazy to load up on Treasuries that they're actually paying us to borrow, taking inflation into account. But while we're currently getting free money from investors, Hungary circa 1945 was getting no money. It was an investment pariah. If Hungary wanted to rebuild its economy, its only recourse was the printing press.    
  
  Second, the United States isn't really printing money. At least not like post-war Hungary. Quantitative easing is usually described as ""money-printing"" but it's not really. QE involves the Fed buying longer-term bonds from banks. It simply swaps one asset for another -- in this case, cash for longer-term bonds. Unlike Hungary, the Fed isn't directly paying the Treasury's bills. This is a hugely important distinction.
  
  Whatever money the Fed ""prints"" is stuck in the banks. That money isn't inflationary as long as the banks don't lend it out. What if the banks do start lending at a faster clip? The Fed can still effectively pay the banks not lend by, for example, raising the interest on excess reserves or require the banks to set aside more money. It would be shocking for the Fed not to pursue one of these options.
  
  Third, the most important difference between us and post-war Hungary or Weimar is that our roads haven't been razed to the ground and half the country isn't striking. It's very difficult to have hyperinflation when you still have a functioning economy. Almost all examples of hyperinflation result from huge economic shocks that devastate an economy so much that leaders think printing money is the only solution to growth. As bad as the Great Recession has been, our GDP is already back to and above its all-time pre-recession high. As bad as unemployment is, more than 80 percent of the labor force is working. In Zimbabwe, 80 percent of the population was unemployed.
  
  Let's conclude with a modest proposal for an economic corollary to Godwin's Law. The first person to reference Weimar's hyperinflation in an economic debate automatically loses.


Yeah, it was written in 2012... Nowadays there are some fears (time will tell if justified) that people returning from the lockdowns [when those end] will cause ""unexpected"" inflation. But that's a different story, not really about QE.

And if you want more recent data on where US inflation is headed, ""this just in"":


  U.S. consumer prices fell by the most in more than five years in March and further decreases  are likely as the novel coronavirus outbreak suppresses demand for some goods and services, offsetting price increases related to shortages resulting from disruptions to the supply chain.
  
  The Labor Department said on Friday its consumer price index dropped 0.4% last month amid a tumble in the costs of gasoline, hotel accommodation, apparel and airline tickets. That was the biggest drop since January 2015 and followed a 0.1% gain in February. 
  
  The general price level decline is expected even as the Federal Reserve has adopted extraordinary measures to stop the economy’s free-fall. [...]
  
  “The disinflationary impulse, along with the great disruption in economic and financial market activity, is a key reason why the Fed is unleashing vast new monetary policy stimulus,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. [...]
  
  Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI dipped 0.1% in March, the first drop since January 2010.

"On Apr 9 2020, the Fed for the First Time Can Buy Junk Bonds. That Should Help ‘Fallen Angels.’


  The Federal Reserve is making its first-ever foray into the junk-rated corporate bond market, saying it will consider buying noninvestment-grade corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds.
  
  As part of an effort to make available \$2.3 trillion in new loans amid the coronavirus crisis, the central bank said Thursday that it would buy the bonds of “fallen angel” companies, or companies that get downgraded from investment grade to junk. Companies will qualify if they had an investment-grade rating on March 22 and have since been downgraded to one of the top three tiers of the high-yield bond market (BB+, BB or BB-).


Bloomberg has a title ""Moral Hazard"".  Can't companies ""leverage themselves into oblivion and when they all [fail] the Fed will just buy their worthless bonds""?


  But the nature of the Fed’s actions pass the traditional boundaries of the central bank to purchase lower-rated debt and the credit of municipalities, raising questions about its future role.
  
  ”That does present some moral hazard but a lot will depend on how these programs are executed and how they’re unwound,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. “Are they executed in a way that doesn’t unduly benefit people? If the programs are devised effectively, hopefully that won’t be the case.”


Are these Reddit comments below correct? I edited r/economics.


  Let’s call it what it is, junk bonds. They don’t care about municipalities, this is buying up corporate garbage debt to bail out the rich. Corporate bonds was bad enough, junk bonds are straight garbage that WAS SUPPOSED TO BE RISKY so why is the Fed buying it. This is no benefit to Main St. at all. If your argument was the municipalities need to issue debt to function and this helps grease that market, the right answer is that municipalities that cannot clearly afford projects should not issue debt. Let’s be honest, boomers had so much money they threw it at high yield, enjoyed the gains but now it’s garbage so the taxpayer is bailing them out.
  
  This is the end of capitalism and free markets. You could argue that a few banks were too big to fail, maybe they should have. Now you are talking about 100’s of companies like Best Buy and Macy’s that we’re already doing bad so we are throwing cash at them in the form of loans and also bailing out their debt to people who shouldn't have bought it. Don’t forget how much these CEOs and boards make.
  
  I hate to be political but let’s remember T[ARP] actually made money, it was risky but the QE was limited in amount and by assets that were “good”. Look at the group of individuals in charge now and their financial history, the idea that the Fed will get its money back is an absolute joke.
  
  Junk bonds are junk because they are risky.
  By definition they don't deserve to be saved by the government.
  
  Its purpose is to place cash on the balance sheets of organizations that invest in securities like junk bonds in the hopes that they will wake up and see credit risk and roll the cash into the stock market to bolster the President's re-election chances.
  
  [Source] Buying junk bonds is stupid - these shitty companies are all getting free money from the fed while at the same time laying off and furloughing millions of workers. Banks and other people with money then buy up ownership in these companies that won’t fail (arguably many should), benefiting from rising stock prices while the companies pay out no wages to workers. It’s all fake and will prop up the wealthy people who own businesses and leave the rest of America in line for food stamps. There is no reason for this insane rally in stock prices when upwards of 10 million Americans are unemployed.

"Covid-19 has forced a suspension of at least 50% of financial transactions and business activities. 

Materially, not much has been lost: consumables have been spared, equipment is dormant, maintenance is mostly inexpensive. Why is the health crisis expected to bankrupt many businesses? Is most of the loss speculative?

Propery tax + land rental = 20-25% of yearly rent, so a landlord can waive rent for 6 months and still make profit! enough to pay 2 years of tax and maintenance. 

I naively imagine that using government moratoriums on bank-debt-interest rates and fees, It is possible for companies to organize a state of dormancy and maintenance for an extended period, without incurring significant loss. 

Can you give a summary of why it is not so simple, and why the losses are a lot worse than a financial and material dormancy? 
","It creates losses. 

First, many businesses don’t own their own building/land/equipment. It’s very common to lease these things. Moreover, many business take out insurance that again has to be paid on monthly basis. In Europe in many countries you need to pay workers certain portion of wages even when you can’t call worker to work or even if they stay home sick. 

The list here is not exclusive. The point is many business have non-trivial fixed costs that have to be payed whether business operates or it doesn’t. Furthermore, in short run even some variable costs - like wages to employees on production line are fixed (and in many countries this can be up to several months). Hence, it’s not like a dormant business have no costs. 

You might ask why then we don’t suspend for example these leases etc. but that just moves the problem to the different parties and does not eliminate this issue. 

Moreover, very large business might have enough financial cushion to absorb losses for few months, but there are many small-medium size business that can’t do that. For example, consider a sole trader (a form of business organization where one person embodies a business) who has a repair shop with no employees just living month to month. That kind of businessman can not afford to go on hiatus for very long.

Furthermore, if by long you mean not just weeks but several months or even year that would be issue even for the best cushioned business.

So yes the impact could be catastrophic. For example according to this VOX blog the impact under some scenarios could be worse than recent 2008 crisis.

"Most signs show that lockdown could easily stretch through the summer. A freeze in consumer spending would cause multiple industries to fail causing a ripple effect.

To be specific, if lockdown lasts through the summer, and a second virus wave occurs in the fall as expected, then lockdowns will continue further into the year. The timeframe for a vaccine is 12-18 months earliest. Then, the vaccine must be manufactured and distributed. Since the virus is so widespread that it is now assumed that it will reach a global critical mass, this essentially guarantees the collapse of the restaurant, airline, tourism, and hotel industries as they cannot sustain prolonged losses in a capitalistic structure. If they fail, their suppliers fail, and so on. History has shown that large systems are prone to failure time and time again, esp. when accountability is obfuscated (e.g. the Titanic, the World Wars/Holocaust, and now this). In the past Egypt fell, and then Rome fell. What is to say our current systems won’t fail, even if as a slowly sinking ship?

EDIT: This question was closed, before I received enough good, thoughtful answers. As of tonight (April 4th) Bernie Sanders held a virtual address on the situation. He's looking at the unemployment projections that were posted by the St. Louis Fed's models and has spoken with a number of economists. Finally a voice of reason in this media circus. He has confirmed that a potential collapse is possible as another 47 million Americans may become jobless - this is unprecedented and would be absolutely devastating to American civilization.
","As a disclaimer, this is not an answer, rather a long-form explanation of the difficulties of answering.

The first leg is uncertainty about the danger of the epidemic. Economists are not medical experts. For example, one could imagine that there is an amazing breakthrough where a common medicine saves patients. The economic effects of that scenario are very different than the scenarios presented by governments. More realistically, we do not know how strong activity restrictions have to be to control the epidemic.

The next leg of uncertainty is the government response. Governments have the capacity to bail out entities (firms, households) that get in trouble. We do not know what they will do.

Even if we knew all that, there is uncertainty about the best model that takes all this in. It is very unusual for governments to restrict economic activity in such a broad-based manner, and so there are no standard models. (There is a flood of research.)

Finally, “conventional” economics does not really spend much time looking into societal collapse scenarios. There are areas of academia that do this, and there is presumably studies in economic history. Experts in those subject areas are not normally visiting this website.

"On Monday, 06 April, 2020 the Financial Times reported that the Federal Reserve balance sheet could increase to $9 trillion.  This is partly due to the myriad of initiatives, some new, to protect the economy of the United States during the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic.  

A lot of online commentary is alarmist and centres on the threat of hyperinflation and many of the news articles don't inform the reader how the Federal Reserve purchases assets.. This puts the average citizen at a disadvantage when understanding the economic impact.  

My question is multi-faceted (but singlular) and aiming to focus purely on the economics.


How does the Federal Reserve unwind the positions on their books?  Do financial services have to purchase the assets back at a later date and does the Federal Reserve charge a premium for the service?
Can a position of this size (60% of national output) actually be unwound?


If this question is similar to the approaches of other Central Banks then please tag accordingly if appropriate.  
","The unwind depends upon what the central bank did.


If the central bank did a repurchase agreement (“repo”) or lent against assets for a fixed time, the agreement automatically unwinds at the term of the deal (which is short). They would need to enter into new deals to keep their balance sheet size unchanged.
If they bought the asset outright, it will either mature, or the central bank can sell ahead of maturity.


There are no “charging a premium” involved; the cost of the operation is embedded in the lending cost (or purchase/sales price of an asset).

There was a very large debate about unwinding central bank balance sheets in the 2010-2016 (?) period. The Fed was eventually able to slowly reduce the size of its balance sheet in the last cycle, and there is no reason to believe that this time is different. There is no sign that an “unwind” was necessary, nor are the effects of unwinding a deep concern.

"I understand that we say something as a gold standard when it involves human intervention/judgement/review.

But can someone help me understand what's the difference between probabilistic gold standard and deterministic gold standard.

For ex: Patient has cancer or not - binary response - Deterministic gold standard which can be provided by humans.

Whereas Patient has 60% chance of being a cancer and 40% chance of not being a cancer. Am I right to understand that this is called as probabilistic gold standard but this can't be produced by Humans right?

Can any human/doctor for example, say this patient has 60% chance of being a cancer and 40 % chance of not  being a cancer?
","No, deterministic probability is when you know for certain. If a person does not have a diagnosis, then he doesn't have the disease/condition. Doctors are not supposed to give a probability but we as human beings always like to know the likelihood.

For example, person A who is 27 years old who has the coronavirus is highly unlikely to die of the virus but it's not impossible.

Does Mcnemar's test apply here for me to check if fatality rate in the Philippines is higher, or do you have any suggestions? Thanks
","It is not a case of paired nominal data. Hence, Mc Nemar's test can not be applied to check whether there is a higher fatality rate   in Philippines ?. THE fatality rate is given for Philippines and world ( excluding Philippines ). As defined,  it is expressed as proportion.

"Was reading a Washington Post article ""Why outbreaks like coronavirus
spread exponentially, and how to flatten the curve” and it looked like they were using Brownian Motion.

(Can't directly link the graphic, but it's the third graphic in the article, showing particles bouncing around, but I've included a screenshot:)



If this is the case, how do particles in a fluid medium resemble interactions in a human population?
","I read this article when it came out. I don't think the point is about whether or not people behave like particles in a fluid medium, but about how quickly people can spread the coronavirus when randomly interacting with one another in an open space (in my opinion, this model would be a reasonably good representation for a crowded area like a mall lobby or a beach where people are moving around more or less randomly).

However, even in other settings when people aren't moving around randomly, if anything, people are more likely to interact with each other in restricted spaces like sidewalks where there is less choice of where to position yourself spatially.

"Across all of Canada, all GoodLife gyms, Fit4Less gyms, university gyms, and presumably other gyms are closed, and for a long time.

I am training for a powerlifting competition and do not have my own 20kg bar and certainly don't have 200kg worth of plates to continue practising deadlifts and squats.

What is the best way to continue making progress on strength for deadlifts and squats?
","I'm sorry, but realistically, you can't.

That being said, if you look at the range of different ""fitness"" qualities (endurance, power, strength, flexibility, etc), strength is generally the last one to go, and it's also one of the easiest to get back once you've initially built it.

There are some things you can try, there is going to be some carry over from bodyweight exercises to the traditional powerlifts (though obviously not as much as training the lifts). Things like dips and pull ups to strengthen the triceps and back. You can do core work because a stronger core is always a good thing. Pistol squats, while not the same as a loaded barbell squat, will allow you to keep training your legs.

Also, now is the perfect time to address all those little niggles and flexibility issues that you've been ignoring. That tight hip, the knee that aches if you keep it in the same position too long, the shoulder that's a little wonky, everything like that.

Fingers crossed, by fixing the little bits and throwing in some bodyweight stuff now, you'll be able to come back stronger (figuratively speaking) when you're able to get back to training.
"
"Over the past several weeks, I have been gaining muscle mass and getting close to PRs across the 5 lifts specified in the Strong Lift Program. Now, many gyms are closed across the United States (and the world) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. What exercises do you recommend that I could do at home and most closely simulates the Strong Lifts 5 x 5 program? For, when the quarantine is over, I don't want to lose my progress in StrongLifts. 

Thanks!
","Unfortunately, unless you have a good home gym set up, you aren't going to be able to carry on with the StrongLifts program.

Sorry, but that's just the way it is.

Now, focusing on the positive, there are a large number of home training options available, depending on what you're willing to invest in and what space you have available.

I like kettlebells, so I own a few of them and can get a good training session in with swings, Turkish get-ups, presses, goblet squats and loaded carries.

Likewise, bodyweight, you can get a good session in with press ups (since you mentioned you've got bad wrists, you can invest in some push up handles, or can you do push ups on your dumbbells?), pull ups, single leg squat variations, planks and Romanian deadlifts using a box full of books (ok, it's not bodyweight, but you get the idea).

Being outside in nature is always a good thing, so load up a backpack with some weight and go for a walk (technically called ""rucking""). While you're at it, occasionally press the bag overhead, or carry it one side or the other, bear hug it to your chest, just play with the position to stress your muscles.

If you've only been training for a few weeks, chances are that you'll still gain strength from any sort of training, provided you don't slack off. No, it won't be StrongLifts style training, but stronger is stronger, having a solid core is always a good thing and helps with the powerlifts. Basically, improvise!

"My 5-year-old son started developing a dry cough yesterday (yay...).  He has trouble remembering to cover his mouth when he coughs, despite our reminding him every time he does it, and despite in the past during extended illnesses him finally catching on after our repeating reminders.

Given the possibility of COVID-19 being the cough source, we want to extra make sure the cause of his cough is spread as little through the house as possible.  Is there a way to quickly and effectively get him in the habit of covering his mouth the moment he feels a cough or sneeze coming on?
","Getting someone into the habit of doing anything requires repetition, as that is what a habit is largely: a settled or regular tendency or practice.  

The best way to establish a habit in a child from my experience is to gently remind them to do the habitual action immediately after the ""cue"" for the action.  In this case, it would be to:


Hear your child cough
If they didn't cover: Remind them to cover their mouth
Praise them for covering their mouth


The praise is appropriate either if they did cover their mouth, or if they didn't but they covered their mouth when you told them to (yes, this is pointless, but it establishes the habit).  

There are some more rigorous explanations of this method, such as here; that site goes into some detail about the relationship between ""cue"", ""routine"", and ""reward"".  

It's not something that will happen instantly, but it does work over time.  The key is not to be upset when they fail - don't be negative about it at all.  Just be positive.  Polite reminder to do the action (don't forget to cover your mouth!), praise for doing it (good job covering your mouth), and then repeat!
"
"How would you explain COVID-19 lockdown to a 4 year old given that the lockdown might be in place for months in London?
","First of all, recognize that your concerns may not be the same as your four year old's concerns. This has two implications:


Your child may be worried about things you couldn't have thought of. Your child is likely shielded from or doesn't understand a lot of what's going on, and that can also mean that they don't have access to bits of information that would actually be reassuring. Encourage your child to ask questions about corona, so that they're not left to ponder on their own things that may seem frightening.
You are likely worrying about outcomes your child has no thought of. Try not to pass on your own fears to your child. If pre-school is closed and one parent has to stay home from work to care for the child, recognize that this may be viewed as a mainly positive outcome to the child.


With my three year old, I emphasize that all closures and restrictions (writing from Sweden, we're not currently in full lockdown) are not - ultimately - to protect us from disease, but to protect our elderly from catching it from us. I find that framing to be appealing because it's both true, and I imagine it's less scary to a young child to hear how we all have to chip in and make sacrifices to protect another group, than to convey an image that it's actually unsafe for them to step outside.

Why we should wash our hands and what's so good about vaccines are some things we talk about normally, and the current situation is a good opportunity to put that into context. You can say that it is to avoid this that we vaccinate against a lot of other things, and that scientists are working on a vaccine against this too. That perhaps once your kid will have children of their own, and they will receive a corona vaccine as well in the routine program, and your child will be able to tell their children how they remember what it was like before the vaccine. Washing hands has been a constant battle. Now we've introduced a longer routine, which involves singing a 20-second-long song, and compliance has (temporarily, I assume) increased.

Consider whether you are changing your own behavior in a manner which may require explanation. For instance, if you are suddenly buying groceries in conspicuously larger quantities than normal, or even if they may have seen the images of empty shelves, you may want to point out that you and others are trying to reduce your number of trips to the grocery store, and hence the number of chances you may infect some at-risk person, lest they think that you're actually going to run out of food.

As an adult, it's easy to become consumed by this. We like to stay updated about what's going on in the world, and this is certainly a main event, and a rapidly evolving one. For my own sake, I could easily bingewatch news for the greater part of the day, and spend the remainder hypothesizing over different future scenarios. Recognize that a young child's world is smaller than yours. Talk about it as a thing that's happening right now, but make sure most of your interactions revolve around normal day to day activities. The above is addressing your question, how to talk about corona, but also make sure you don't talk exclusively about corona.

"My children will be home for a few weeks (at least) while schools are closed due to the Coronavirus/COVID-19.  What are some good strategies or options for helping them continue to learn while at home?

","Khan Academy is a great resource for letting children learn math and science/technology at any age.  It allows children to progress through different subjects, includes videos to teach them each subject and then offers practice questions to help them master subjects.

I have been offering my children 2 hours of Khan Academy per day, plus 1 hour of reading, 1 hour of practice programming (using Scratch or Python), and 1 hour of more gamified learning (such as Prodigy, which is basically Pokémon but with math problems needing to be solved in order to do damage to your opponent!).

"So tonight at bedtime, my child was wanting someone to stay with them (until they fell asleep). We have had a busy few days so maybe they were just wanting some quality time. 

However I am a little concerned that they may be feeling unsettled. Given COVID-19 we have been encouraging them to wash their hands more often and properly, and to make sure they catch their cough in their elbow. Explaining that people can get sick if (we all) don't do that. This made them think they were sick.

So tonight I wanted to ask if they were feeling ok. But I didn't want to give them any leading prompts, in case I projected that worry onto them. I tried asking why they wanted mummy or daddy to stay next to them and they answered 'Because I want you to stay next to me'. Hmmm a tautology. Technically true but not very useful. 

Are there any techniques which are useful to tease out if and why a child may be unsettled, without suggesting something that is not there they then may absorb and think they should be worried about?
","A child that I am close to (7) has had some events in her life that made her a bit closed off, but she loves to draw so her mother taught her to express herself through drawing. 

She asked her to draw how she feels each day, and from the reoccurring themes she was able to see that on the days she seemed sad she often drew herself alone and the drawings often had darker/blueish colors, and on the happier days lighter colors with red and yellow surrounded by either friends or family. From which she kinda concluded that her kid was afraid to be alone (this was shortly after her divorce). It also helped her discovered that she was afraid of wasps/bees because she heard people who are allergic can die from a sting. 

It's probably not a fast solution to your problem but maybe you can trick your kid in to telling what is wrong by letting them draw about their feelings/day. After a few days you might spot a recurring theme that you can tackle.

"I am looking for some urgent advice with how to proceed. My wife is constantly emotionally and physically abusive to both my 3 and 5-year-old. She belittles both, plays favorites, talks about her impending death, threatens them with all manner of scary stories and regularly slaps then on the head or back with an open palm.

I am convinced she has a personality disorder including OCD and NPD (I suggested therapy and was told to f-off). She has been drunk while they are in her care on many occasions as well.

She is currently a stay-at-home mum, however, we have had a maid since the eldest was born who bathed and fed them, and now I work from home and do most of the cleaning etc.. She is simply a person who wants to continue her life undisturbed by kids, she still has her Friday night (though they can be a midweek one as well) blow-outs, coming home blind drunk and vomiting like clockwork.

I am scared to leave her with the kids as she is extremely lax when it comes to safety. We live on the 38th floor and she has left the balcony door open many times, and now she is not bothered about closing the baby gate and letting the boys run free in the kitchen. Her latest act has been to go clubbing and drinking in pubs during this coronavirus outbreak without taking any precautions and coming home completely wasted. (BTW we live in Hong Kong).

I am writing this from a coffee shop as I have been forced out by her gal pals who are over for drinks. I have endured this for 18 yrs now. I want to get advice on how I can proceed? Do I simply rock up at the CPA and tell them the situation? Why would they believe me? How to prove this? I would give her everything as long as I can care for the boys.
","The mother does not seem like she will change her ways. Some people might encourage you to try to talk to her about her treatment of the kids, to give her an ultimatum, but personally I think this could just make the situation worse. You need to get the kids away from her. The best way to do this would be the legal route, unless you greatly expect that she will happily let you have full custody, not wanting to see the kids for them, or out of spite against you. 

Any evidence you can get will be very useful. The maid may be able to support what you say, depending on how open your wife is with her mistreatment of the kids. I'd also suggest trying to get some video or audio recordings, but you should look into whether these can be used in court if the other person is not aware that they are being recorded. 

In terms of the kitchen, I suggest kid-proofing it. Try to store any dangerous items out of their reach, and any low cupboards that need to store dangerous items should have childproofing locks.

"What practical approaches are recommended or possible to minimize covid-19 exposure during child visitation, weekend visit, with the non-custodial parent?  Are there medical or legal guidelines on this topic?  (I live in Georgia, in the USA.)
","First: we are not able to answer legal questions, so don't take this as really addressing the legal side of things.  Look up those details in your area specifically or ask a lawyer for that.

In general, visitation is likely still possible currently.  See this advice from Nolo:


  How do Social Distancing Rules Affect Custody Arrangements?
  
  
    The social distancing and shelter-in-place rules don't directly affect custody orders, so you should continue following your current custody arrangement unless you and your ex agree to an alternative plan or a judge changes your custody order.
    
    Courts are making it clear that disobeying court orders or withholding visitation during this time won't be tolerated and may result in contempt of court. But if you have valid concerns about your child's health and safety, you can try communicating with your ex to see what you can both do to reduce the risks to your child.
    
    Within a family unit, creating an effective social distancing plan can be as simple as adopting rules for parents and children to follow within their home. But for divorced or separated parents, social distancing and staying healthy when children are going back and forth between two households can be challenging.
  


An example of a state issuing guidance on this is Delaware:


  To be clear, neither the State of Emergency nor the Seventh Modification interferes with or invalidates any existing Family Court order regarding custody or visitation. Custody and visitation orders remain in full force and effect. Travel (including interstate travel) for the purposes of complying with a Family Court order is considered essential travel and permitted. Such travel was deemed essential in Governor Carney’s Fifth Modification to the COVID-19 State of Emergency Declaration issued March 22, 2020. Under the Seventh Modification, such travel remains essential and is excluded from the selfquarantine requirement. 


CNN indicates that some states have more vague language, however:


  Other states have left rulings vague. In Massachusetts, for example, John D. Casey, chief justice of probate and family court, last week issued an open letter that said, ""both parents should cooperate.""


Some states are apparently encouraging (but not requiring) virtual visitation, such as Vermont:


  How is the Department for Children and Families dealing with social distancing?
  
  
    According to Johnson, DCF has called its families to ask if they would be willing to have virtual visitations.
  


That all said: you should consider the risks that visitation would bring.  If your child, or anyone in either household, is in the 'high risk' category, for example a child who is immunocompromised due to medication, or an elderly parent living at home with the family, it may be appropriate to limit or eliminate in person visitation.  That would depend on an agreement between the two parents, though, to modify the arrangements temporarily; it would not be automatic.

It is highly recommended to have a conversation with your ex-partner, and be clear about your concerns and open to creative ideas.  It may be safer to have fewer handoffs for longer periods of time - if it is normally 5 days / 2 days, then perhaps 3 weeks / 1 week is possible, for example, if the normally noncustodial parent is not working or is working at home and able to spend time with the child.  The linked CNN article above has more recommendations along these lines.  

Facetime/Skype/Zoom/etc. are good options for maintaining contact with the child without personal contact.  Many activities can take place over videochat; reading a book to them, playing a board game virtually (one person moves pieces for the other player of course; or some games, like Battleship, can be played completely remotely); online games, of course, as well.

"I used to travel a lot and take photographs at those places. Now borders are closed due to COVID-19 precautions and we'll be probably ordered to stay at home except some special cases.
What are my photography options in this situation?
","First of all: Do everything your government tells you to do. Follow the recommendations. Be rational and don't be careless or selfish!

In case you can still move freely in your area:


Explore your neighbourhood. You may be surprised what a nearby forest, park or an old quarry can offer.
Visit places otherwise occupied by tourists (now probably empty).
Learn something new. Change your photography genre to a safer one like from street to birds etc.


In case you have to stay at home:


Study photography. Learn things you can use in the future.
Catalogue your pictures. Eliminate the mess. Now you have time to do that.
Post-process your older pictures again. Try creating new, better versions.
Try studio/abstract photography.

"I have been using a Nikon D5200 with a Tamron 100-400 zoom for wildlife photography. It's admittedly a budget setup (in some sense of the term ""budget""), so I don't expect amazing results. I'm also not a trained photographer, and I've pretty much learned by reading the internet and youtube (not ideal, I know). Recently, I decided to rent a different Nikon body for an expedition (which ultimately got canceled due to COVID-19).

I decided to rent a mirrorless Nikon Z6 to see how I would like a mirrorless camera, and to try a full-frame sensor, and also just to get a newer sensor and body and see how the quality compares, using the same Tamron lens.

I made a lot of mistakes in using the new body, but ultimately I'm stumped still. The photos are displaying the same annoying glow that I've seen with the old body. I don't know what is causing it, but it seems like I can narrow it down to ""operator"" or lens errors.



In the image above, a heavily cropped section of a photo of a bird, you can see the glow. It shows up similarly using either body. This is shot at 400mm, ISO 320 f/6.3, 1/500 sec. 

I handhold the camera most of the time because I just can't use a tripod for most of these photos (the birds are up in a tree, jumping around, etc.)

Does anyone have any suggestions for what I should do here? Should I use faster shutter speed and higher ISO? I've tried that and found that I get a lot of noise, but maybe the newer sensors can handle it? I'd be willing to spend some $$ on a book or read any references people might recommend. 

Thanks!

EDIT
This image is uncorrected, straight out of the camera, though (sadly) I took it as a JPG originally. I usually shoot raw, but had my settings incorrect for this new body that I'm renting. I see the same effect whether it's RAW or JPG though, it was just that this photo showed the effect more strongly so that I could illustrate my question.
","You appear to be using your lens (100-400/5-6.3) with the aperture wide open.  I would expect the glow in your photos to be significantly reduced or absent stopped down to about F8.

Many lenses ""glow"" when used wide open, especially in bright light with high contrast. It is likely associated with spherical aberration and is typically reduced or completely gone when the aperture is closed a stop or two. Increased familiarity with the lens' behavior and characteristics will allow you to predict when the glow will and won't be present. You will then be able to select apertures to match your artistic intent.

"I am spanish and I have got a job offer in the UK as a tutor in a college starting in August 2020. It Is not permanent job.
Do I need visa to work there as a spanish tutor?
I don't live in England.
","As I understand it, during the ""transition period"" free movement still applies, so until the end of the year you can in-principle move to the UK and take a job without a visa. You can then apply under the EU settlement scheme to remain in the UK after the end of the transition period.

The big wildcard here though is the covid-19 situation. Right now face to face education in the UK is basically shut down and establishments are struggling to figure out how to teach remotely. People are being told not to travel unless it is essential. Frankly at this time noone knows how the situation will have developed by August.
"
"I know this is a kind of question we have probably already asked but I keep reading and I never get the answer I look for, I never find the same situation.

I am French, living in Spain and my boyfriend is American living in NYC. He has his own business with his brother and before we met they already wanted to expand the business (creams and body care oils) to Europe. 

He wanted to hire a person to be in charge of all the translation work, calls, emails and European marketing in general for Europe. I don't want to go to the US, I am fine here in Spain but we found it stupid to hire someone to do this job when I am actually a teacher and translator here in Spain. So the plan would be to go there for a year to help them get into European business, teach them a bit of Spanish and French so they can travel (they already are in touch with potential clients) and get to know the products etc. being at the stores they have. After all this, the idea is to come back before next summer as I plan to open my little language school and he plans to open another store here in Spain.

Can he hire me even if I am his girlfriend? Nothing is official we are neither married nor pareja de hecho as we call it here. If he puts an offer online and present my resume etc for H1B visa, in the case to be approved (which I doubt with all this Corona virus thing), am I able to tell the embassy he is my boyfriend ? I mean I don't want to lie and I don't think it is an option actually, and as I really don't wanna live in the US neither... I have no plan to stay over there for green card they can be sure I will not. I have lots of stuff ready for my future school which is also a proof that I clearly have other things in mind than the US.

How should we do this?
","The H1B process takes time, luck, qualifications, fees, and skilled form-filling. I suggest avoiding it by never working in the US. You would go on living in Spain and only visit the US for short periods.

In practice, you would use the Visa Waiver Program, but B-1 Temporary Business Visitor lists the permitted business activities for a visitor to the US.

Short term training should cover getting to know the products. Discussing marketing strategy would be consulting with business associates.

Translations and marketing can be done from anywhere in the world. Calls and e-mails are best done from the correspondents' timezone or close to it, so being in Europe would be an advantage. To promptly return a 9 a.m. call from someone in France you would need get up very early in New York.

You would not be allowed to teach your boyfriend and his brother while visiting the US, but you could teach remotely and you could travel with them whenever they are in Europe to translate, smooth their way, and teach them the languages. As time goes on you do less talking and translating, until they can do business in Europe without you and you can get on with starting your school.

"My Instructor residence status for Japan is valid until 2022. I left Japan two months ago to visit my country of citizenship, the US, with the intention of returning and starting a new job before 90 days had elapsed. Due to unforseen circumstances, I'm having to postpone my return to and employment in Japan until August or September.

I notified Immigration using the required form within several days of finishing my last employment, and got a ""Special Re-entry Permit"", valid for 1 year, stapled in my passport at the airport when I left the country (I have my zairyu card). However, my understanding is that my residence status can be revoked after 90 days of not engaging in my ""designated activity"".

If I accept an offer for a job in Japan starting in August or September, what should I do about my residence status? Do I assume it will be cancelled when I pass the 90-day mark? Do I need to request that Immigration cancel it before an employer applies for a new COE on my behalf? Or is there a way to keep it valid until my return?

"Inspired by Avi's Vowelburger™ Riddle  

Vowelburgers™ is proud to announce the first ever Penta-decker Vowelburger™. This means six consonant buns sandwiching five vowel patties as shown:



Here is the menu's description of their first burger:

Can you identify what type this burger is from the description on the menu?

Note: The full name of the penta-decker burger contains layers 1-5 from left to right.

Hint:


   Eating the Penta-decker Vowelburger™ is like eating 5 regular* Vowelburgers™ merged with each other; in other words, the top of the first layer is the bottom of the next.

*The word ""regular"" here means a bottom bun, single patty, and a top bun.


Hint 2:


   Each layer comes with lots of add-ons; those add-ons will be discarded, though, since we don't want the burger to get too high. From each layer, we extract only the simple Vowelburger™ from the bottom. (Note: the bottom is the left side of the word.)

Feedback section: the method of solution wasn't very clear until after the hints. At first I'd assumed we'd be looking for three-letter words each time, so I didn't get anywhere solving this. It was clear that part of the puzzle would be to figure out why there's a number together with each clue, but I didn't think we'd need to find a longer word and then cut out just part of it to make the Penta-Decker. My suggestion would be to clue this somehow in the flavour text, so that it doesn't seem so arbitrary. Something like:


  Making this new burger requires a lot of ingredients, each of which should be cleaned and processed before adding it to the burger.


Bonus: talking about ""cleaning"" the ingredients relates indirectly to the solution as well as referring to cleaning off the excess letters!

"Is this normal?

I've got about 10 quail meats and some of them have these spots.

Are these safe to cook and eat? Is it possible that they had a disease or were infected?

I'm scared of Coronavirus, and chickens and quails can carry influenza and Coronavirus is a type of influenza, so could this be related?



I've googled a lot but I can't find anything on it:
""Quail red OR black OR dark spot on meat""
etc.

My question is not a duplicate of: red spots on the chicken
","It's just clotted blood.

Quail is a far more game-y meat than chicken meaning there is much more muscle and you end up with a lot of dark meat. You get the same with truly free range chickens.

This is nothing to worry about and I have never seen a quail which doesn't look like that.

"What chemical product should I use to disinfect surfaces that may get in contact with the food? (wooden table where I knead bread/pasta and etc)

With this COVID-19 frenzy it's impossible to find alcohol (what I usually use for cleaning) so my wife bough a bunch of Clorox desinfecting wipes. I was wondering if it's safe to use it
","This is honestly a HUGE topic, with literally reams of government guidelines on what's effective for surface disinfection.  For example:


USDA Clean Then Sanitize
FSIS Cleaning Regulations
5 Steps of cleaning and disinfection

"My neighbor who also bakes has run out of yeast and can't find any in the store. We went shopping this afternoon and couldn't find any either.

I have a fair-sized jar of the stuff in my fridge, but I'm also baking a lot. I'm worried about it running out, plus I'd like to share with my neighbor.

Is there a recommended technique for propagating it myself so I don't run out, and have enough to share?
","Absolutely there is a way to propagate yeast, it's as simple as making a starter with it. Most of the time these days people create starters for sourdough using natural yeasts, but you can use them to feed any kind of yeast. All you would do is put flour and water in a container with some yeast, let it get to work and once you start to get bubbles put it in the fridge to slow it down. You would then use half of it for every batch of bread you make, replacing the flour and water to keep it at the same quantity. 

If you don't use any of it for a few days you'd want to throw half away and refill in order to give the yeast a fresh supply of food. You can share this with as many people as you like, just split it into two, give each a fresh supply of flour and water, and repeat as many times as necessary. Using this technique a small amount of yeast could theoretically supply the entire planet. 

NOTE: During the Coronavirus outbreak it's worth noting that corona can survive on surfaces for quite some time, so you should take great care to ensure that your yeast propagation does not lead to virus propagation!

"Thanks to coronavirus, a local restaurant supply company is offering home delivery, and I ordered a ten pound bag of boneless skinless chicken breasts. There were eight of them in there...EIGHT! For an average weight of 20 oz each!

I have kids who like their food white. My usual method for BSCBs of a reasonable size is a quick brine and bake, pound them a bit and steam in a covered skillet, or just boil 'em (I know, it's sad). Will these monsters turn out okay if I treat them this way? 

Secondarily, if I were going to cook something with actual flavors, what would you recommend?
","It really depends on what types of meals you plan to make with them.

If you would typically serve people a whole breast, then I'd cut each one down into more reasonable sizes (slice vaguely across the grain ... I usually start at the more bulbous end and slice diagonally through it so I end up with a chunk that's mostly from the thin end)

For the size you're starting with, you might want to cut each one into 4 to 6 pieces.  If you're planning on pounding them, I might even go with 8 to 10 pieces.

Once they're a more reasonable size, you can then brine and bake them or pound them out, them like you normally would.

As you mention boiling them ... I would recommended poaching them instead.  If you cut them up first, go with my original recommendation of an hour.  If they went in whole, I might give it two hours.  The technique that I mention is more like a slow cooker -- it's more forgiving and doesn't tend to overcook the outside before the middle is done  (although, it can get fall-apart tender, and start breaking up as you try to fish them out with tongs.

"I am a 23 year old living in Romania, currently renting an apartament. I am  earning enough that I am now looking to buy an apartment of my own in the near future with a mortgage loan, but, right now, I think there is a housing bubble about to burst, at least in the area I live in. 

This site shows the price graphs for apartments in my living area. It seems that the prices are reaching the values they were at before the 2008 recession. Is it reasonable to expect them to drop similarly to how they did 12 years ago? If the prices do drop within the next 3 years, is it reasonable to expect that I would be able to get the same kind of loan I am eligible for getting now from a bank?

From a purely financial perspective, does it make more sense to buy an apartment now, despite the inflated prices, or wait for the bubble to burst and buy at that point?
","You can't make a market prediction based purely on the current market value. The value is a function of supply and demand. To make any sort of reasonable prediction you would need to understand population in your area and predictions on population growth/shrinkage, demographics e.g. are the sort of people who would buy an apartment likely to increase as a proportion of the population in your area, and are there already any house building initiatives planned in your area to meet any expected population growth. These are some of the immediate local indicators which is possible to find out about. Then there may also be macro/global factors which may not be possible to predict e.g. if coronavirus suddenly wiped out 5% of global population what effect would that have on global property demand? Basically unless you can do extensive research and analysis then you are better off trying to find an expert with some relevant credentials, or not attempting to time the market at all.
"
"There is a fundamental discrepancy or paradox that has been keeping myself, and many others, away from the stock market. Before I explain it, let me mention some selected popular questions on this site in which the consensus is that in the long term a broad investment in the stock market will yield a substantially positive average annual return rate:

Why should we expect stocks to go up in the long term?

Why do people claim that Stock Markets are broadly exponential in the long term?

Why isn't everybody rich?

Stock market long term risks

Is it a lie that you can easily make money passively in the stock market?

Are Index Funds really as good as “experts” claim?

In view of all this consensus, we can almost say that it has become ""common knowledge"" that investing in the broad stock market (sufficient diversification) on a long term perspective (several decades) is a very good investment strategy. More precisely, the consensus seems to be that there is some average annual return rate, say 3% (replace this number by something higher/lower if you prefer), such that if your investment is diversified enough and your timespan is long enough, the risk that your actual average annual return rate drops below that rate tends towards zero.

Now comes the first question: Why doesn't any (serious) bank offer a savings account with a fixed 2% interest rate for an unlimited amount of time? 

After all, a large bank has the optimal prerequisites for diversification and holding stocks for many decades, and if the above is true, then they would still earn at least 1% of their customer's account values each year by essentially doing not very much except buying and selling some index funds according to what customers want to withdraw or pay in. 

My own first objection to the question would be the following: If there is a market crash and at the same time a lot of customers want to withdraw money from their accounts, the bank might be in big trouble because the total value of the stocks owned by the bank could be less than what the customers want to withdraw.

However, I feel that this is not really an objection because even without the above ""obvious product"" banks will always be in trouble if their customers want to withdraw too much money at once. 

What's bothering me even more is the

Second question: Why don't all banks borrow a huge amount of money from the central bank and invest it in the stock market on a broad, long-term basis? 

As far as I know, banks can borrow money from the central bank at quite low interest rates (much less than the expected long-term average annual return rate of the broad stock market), in Europe that interest rate is currently even negative. So why don't all banks just buy index funds using this free money and just hold them forever, watching them grow in value?



Edit: After the first few answers (and some downvotes) I immediately realized that it was a big mistake to specialize the question in the sense that I only asked why banks don't do the ""obvious"" things, rather than having simply asked why no-one or  no specialized company does the ""obvious"" things. I am very glad that in the further course of events my question was received in a slightly more abstract way. Thank you all for your answers and upvotes, earning me a gold badge with my very first question on this site! If one could only trade in those badges for their real world counterparts... ;-)
","Fundamentally, I think there's a high level (and perhaps unsatisfying) answer to this. It's because that's not ""banking"" as a business, and a bank is established to do banking, not to get into the stock market. In other words, this question strikes me about the same as asking,


  why don't ice cream shops stop selling ice cream, and instead get in the business of selling pancakes? After all, you can make a lot of money selling pancakes.


Well yes, you can get rich selling pancakes, but not every business is a pancake shop. Certainly, some businesses get rich selling pancakes, but other businesses with different motivations and risk tolerances decide to sell ice cream instead.

To make this clear in your banking context: such a business would essentially be called a hedge fund or investment management company, not a bank. It's fine if a company wants to be a hedge fund, but a company that is calling itself a bank can't secretly switch over to being a hedge fund, and still call itself a bank while supporting ""banking"" activities for normal consumers.

From a more practical perspective, most jurisdictions have carefully developed regulations that would essentially prohibit a business calling itself a bank from doing what you're discussing. Essentially, these regulations exist because of my first point - the business model you're describing isn't ""banking."" And, regulations are designed around that, in the sense that regulations keep banks acting like banks and stop them from trying to act like something that isn't a bank.

I'm editing to clarify a portion of your question, as an example of this disconnect. You said,


  As far as I know, banks can borrow money from the central bank at quite low interest rates


That's not really the whole story. Think of it this way. Imagine if you were to walk into a retail bank right now, and ask for a loan for a million dollars. The bank would certainly ask you some questions, including asking what you intended to do with that money and how you could show proof that you are able to pay it back. If you were able to prove that you have a large and stable income, and that you were planning on using the million dollars to purchase a home that's actually worth a million dollars, you might get approved. But what if you told the bank, ""I'm actually empty handed, but I'm going to go invest this in the stock market, I think I have a proven way to make a positive return"" - they might deny you on the spot, or at least they might have a lot more questions for you!

The relationship between central banks and retail banks is fundamentally similar. A retail bank can't just call up the central bank and say, ""please wire me a billion dollars"" and instantly, the money shows up. Retail banks essentially have to go through a process of validating their operational intentions, showing proof that they can pay the loan back, and perhaps even putting up collateral, before the money changes hands. And, a retail bank with no collateral who indicated that they wanted to play the stock market would almost certainly get turned down by the central bank.

I'm making another edit to address another core flaw in your assumptions. You said,


  we can almost say that it has become ""common knowledge"" that investing in the broad stock market (sufficient diversification) on a long term perspective (several decades) is a very good investment strategy


While that may be a sound theory it's not a practical method for a bank to keep or invest assets, because of liquidity and predictability. It may be accurate to say that ""in the long term"" a diversified stock portfolio can be bulletproof. But banks can't issue cash to deposit customers based on long term theories. They have to be able to predict the availability of funds very well - the stability of their outcomes, not just the expected result. In other words, if a bank has $10 billion in assets, they need to know precisely how much of that will be available to them tomorrow, or next Tuesday, or in six months. Your stock market theory may have the right expected outcome (positive growth), but it's got far too much potential variance on any particular day. Yes, ""in the long run"" you may make money, but can you tell me exactly how much cash you'll have next Tuesday? No, you can't. You might have an acceptable expected outcome on Average for all ""next Tuesdays"" - but what if coronavirus takes off in the US this weekend? Or something else happens? Banks aren't just concerned about the expected outcome, they're also concerned about variability in the range of expected outcomes. People do ""banking activities"" like deposit their paycheck into a deposit account, or take out a credit card loan, with the expectation of stability and availability of funds. Those ""features"" which are essentially the definition of retail banking come as a trade off in terms of a slightly lower return (compared to your stock market portfolio).

"For example, if I am trading a SP500 ETF on the NYSE, the stock exchange opens at 3:30pm CET. Due to the time shift, the stock exchanges in the EU open at 9am CET, meaning I can already gather chart information from SP500 ETFs that are traded here. 

Real life example: The SP500 ETF (even though it's the one traded on an EU stock exchange) gains a lot of value again after the corona virus crash. Is it practically possible to use this information to my advantage by immediately buying shares at the NYSE when it opens later? I know that technically the charts aren't connected with each other as each stock exchange trades it's own shares but in reality they are still correlating. 

To be fair, due to the duration of an order I think it wouldn't be possible to take advantage of this small marge, but what about big banks with higher volume and high speed trading?

No. The simple reason why is that even if you buy immediately when the market opens, that's still too late.

As an example, imagine that there's a single ETF which trades both in the United States (from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm US Eastern time) and in Great Britain (from 4:30 am to 11:00 am US Eastern time).

Now let's imagine that it's 4:30 am Eastern, and the ETF begins trading at $80. However, the price of the ETF increases over the course of the day, so that by 9:25 am Eastern, the price of the ETF is $100.

Can you take advantage of this by buying shares of the ETF in the United States immediately upon open? No, because when it starts trading in the United States, it will start trading at about $100, not at $80. You'll be paying $100 for shares worth $100, which is, of course, a profit of $0.

Maybe you're thinking that when the market opens, the opening price is the same as the previous day's closing price. This is not the case. The market won't open at $80 and then immediately rise to $100; it will simply open at $100.

"I am about to buy an apartment (in a major city in central Europe) to live in, mostly with borrowed capital (around 80%). The price was set before the financial crisis due to the corona virus started. Should I change my plans? Is there any possibility of saying whether the crisis also had an impact on the real estate prices so far? My personal situation is stable in the sense that my job is rather safe despite the crisis. Should I continue to buy the apartment as planned?

Note: I am aware that the future cannot be predicted, what I want to find out is the following: Since the price for ""my"" apartment was set before the corona crisis started, is there already any evidence that the real estate prices in major cities in central Europe have taken a hit? I.e. I am not asking about the future development but rather about a comparison of the situation before the corona crisis to the present situation. 
It would also be interesting whether in the past the stock market was correlated with the real estate prices, particularly during / after crises.
","It's unlikely that you would be able to have firm evidence of a sudden drop in price so rapidly. Reason for that is that the real estate market is a bit peculiar: Transactions take time to put together and it can take a long time for prices to adjust. The real estate market is not nearly as liquid as the stock market, international commodity markets or flower auctions.

When there is a real estate crash, it's common for the number of transactions to drop while buyers and sellers figure out the new price. Sellers, especially individuals who have a lot invested in their house, a (possibly underwater) mortgage to pay back, etc. are not ready to lower their asking price at once. Some might prefer to sell their house for the same price several years later rather than selling it at its real price right now. Buyers who are concerned about paying too much (like yourself) wait for the price to feel more reasonable relative to everything else. Those who need to sell a house before buying another one might also be stuck. And nobody knows exactly where the market might clear in between.

But, right now, you would not expect many real estate transactions to be happening in Europe. Real estate agencies are forced to close in several countries, it's not possible to visit houses, etc. So it's difficult to have any idea of what the current prices are, whether the drop in the number of transactions reflects a drop in the underlying market or is just a side-effect of the current measures to fight the pandemic, or how fast everything is going to go back to normal.

"My AFORE already lost a chunk of money in my retirement savings, i'm not sure what to do, i'm afraid if  leave the rest of my money i will lose even more and it's gonna take a while to recover those losses.

I'm considering:


Taking out the money to a regular savings account and wait for the crisis to pass
Just wait and see what happens


Any recommendations? I worked hard to save that money and have a decent retirement when i become older.
","The critical question is posed in a comment by BernhardDöbler: do you need this money soon?

The danger in selling is that you may be following the pattern of many casual investors: fear of missing out drives them to buy stocks when the market is very strong and then fear of losing all drives them to sell when the market is very weak. They end up ""buying high and selling low"" which is a guaranteed way to lose money. 

On the other hand, if you do need the money in the near term, you pretty much have to accept the loss and sell. Whether you should sell now or a month from now is probably not answerable by anybody without a crystal ball.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the market has just received a solid wallop of information that a bunch of companies are not going to make nearly as much money this year as they thought they were. Some companies may experience a cash flow crisis that bankrupts them. If you own individual stocks and have the analysis skills, you might review your holdings and try to figure out if any of the companies you hold are in danger of going under. If your retirement is in index funds that you don't need for a few years, then I'd suggest sitting tight. Eventually the pandemic will end, planes will start flying again, and the markets will likely return to some semblance of normal.

"With all the coronavirus panic, I was wondering what would happen when the share price reaches £0 for a company, but the actual company itself or their business niche is not that much affected, i.e. the company is still operating and it's far from going bankrupt.

I'm not interested in answers that this is a good buy. I would like to understand what happens to existing share holders and the company itself, if shares for the company will hit £0. Is such an event possible?

This is for companies traded in the UK.
","Share price is determined simply by supply and demand. Changes in the share price typically don't directly affect the company's operations, though there are some ways that it could (e.g. when the price is lower, stock compensation must include more shares to make up the difference).

Practically speaking, the share price for an active company never reaches 0. There are always people willing to buy at a low enough price. Furthermore, the price reported for a stock is the last price at which the stock was sold. If demand for the stock were to fall to 0, there would simply be no liquidity (no shares of the stock bought or sold), but the share price would still be reported at whatever the last transaction price was. The effect on shareholders would be that they would not be able to sell their stock (because there's no demand). They'd have to hold it until someone is willing to buy it.

"We all hear about the massive fluctuations of the stock market due to fears and responses to the coronavirus pandemic. The market also has also triggered ""circuit breakers"" that temporarily halt trading to prevent massive swings. 

What could potentially happen if they just halted all trading for the next two months as a medium-term circuit breaker? Assume they did it at night without warning so that people couldn't get trades in before the closure. Would the rest of the economy continue to function otherwise (other coronavirus effects not withstanding)? During the closure, I would imagine that stock prices would just stay the same and then companies would adapt to their changing supply and demand situation as needed, right? 

Once it opened again there might be a swing once we know which companies have survived the pandemic and which won't but that speculation is happening on a daily basis now, why not just close it to prevent chaos and allow companies to think longer term without worrying about momentary market valuation?
","This idea of an extended ""market holiday"" is a completely normal idea.  A lot of people have had this idea, especially today, and I'll tell you below why it's terrible.  Just flat-out bad.  I once had this idea during the GFC when I was also new-ish to the market, so don't feel bad.  

I believe one of the CNBC hosts was touting this idea this morning.  A simple way to refute one of the underlying notions here is thus: If you don't like what you see then just go ahead and close your eyes, and the bad thing will go away right?  Of course not.

You might say ""Maybe the market just doesn't know what stocks are worth right now and that's why the market is down.""  I'd answer  that no one ever really knows exactly what a business/stock is worth (some exceptions aside).  Generally, people who sell think it's worth less than the price and people who buy think it's worth more, so why do we need to shut the market?  

You might say ""Maybe not everyone feels comfortable trading or feels like they know what this specific business/stock is worth right now so that's why we should halt trading.""  I'd answer with why can't the people that do want to trade continue trading and if you don't know/ just aren't ""comfortable"" then step aside, no one is forced to trade (unless maybe they used leverage/need the money).  

The punchline on extended market holidays, reiterated: Except in cases of traders or technology used to trade actually being unavailable/overtaxed for some reason, it's something we should avoid at all costs.  There are lots of negatives, and I'm not aware of any positives outside of the corner cases mentioned above.

A surprise trading halt as you mentioned of an extended variety is one of the worst things that can be done to a market.  Imagine...


Surprise! That thing you owned that you thought was liquid and you could buy or sell on most days Monday-Friday, excepting holidays, actually isn't!  And if you need to raise money between now and the market re-opening, tough! 
When the market does re-open, going forward, everything in that market should be priced more cheaply in one respect, and that is to account for a new illiquidity premium that has been introduced to the market.  All else equal, if you could own the same stock on two exchanges and one had random extended trading halts while the other didn't, there should be a disparity in the pricing, albeit not massive, between the two.  I'd rather own the one that trades more frequently.  Illiquidity in an asset is not a good thing.  
Just because something isn't trading and its price stays the same doesn't mean its value is not changing, it just means that it's harder to estimate(no one can truly see it) that true value.  It's quite possible that when the market reopened some of the companies would be worthless.  See the bullet two down on the economy for more info here. 
It's harder for everyone to deal in securities that have random extended halts because of those halts, which hurts liquidity even further going forward.  Less liquidity is bad.
The rest of the economy would continue to function, but not as well as it would with the market open.  So many transactions happen in the market on a daily basis and while some of these are retail or professional investors trading in the market, many of these trades are transactions where one company is hedging their exposure to another company.  Or, just using the market to see a gauge of the health of their counterparty to determine if they're going to engage in a business transaction and if so at what level with what other terms.  Imagine one company is buying components from another.  Each will look at the markets to judge the health of the other in their negotiations.  Without functioning markets, that process gets more difficult and it is exponentially more difficult at times of stress when companies are worried about the health of other companies.  That is when it is most important for markets to be open.  If markets are not, distrust reigns and activity/deals between companies grind to a halt.  That harms the economy.
Closing the market doesn't allow companies to think longer term.  Closing the market causes everyone to speculate which companies are in credit trouble and won't be around.  Others seek to limit or avoid exposure to the firms that might be failing by cancelling orders and halting shipments. Just the rumor that someone is in trouble will cause others to stop dealing with that firm and then it really is over for the company in question.  If the market was open that didn't have to happen.
The ""chaos"" you describe is simply the process of price discovery in times of uncertain economic outlook.  The market is volatile, it is what it is.  Instead of wondering what companies are likely worth for the next two months we can let them trade and have a best estimate.  That's what the market is, an estimating machine for the value of businesses. 
Those values are very important to businesses as they do business with each other.  The stock market is not some pure speculation machine/ random number generator that pushes values around willy-nilly.    
Think of it this way: Maybe I don't like when prices change so we should just have stocks trade once a year, then everyone can really ""plan long term?""  That sounds ludicrous right?  It's the same idea.
The world is a scarier place, companies are making less, businesses are hurting, people are dying and stocks are worth less as a result.  Closing our eyes won't make the situation any better.  Restricting trade by closing the market would hurt the underlying economy.  Trade is generally a pretty good thing.

"I read somewhere online that the US goverment may close the stock market because of Covid2019. Is the upshot the same as a company going bankrupt?

I'm still confused on put options when a company goes bankrupt : stocks


  Example:
  
  You own one $10 put option on SNAP
  
  If SNAP goes to $1, than you have the RIGHT to exercise your contract and buy 100 shares for $1 and sell it immediately for $10. If the stock price goes to $0 (in case of bankruptcy) you still have the RIGHT (and the person that sold you the option the OBLIGATION) to buy the shares for $0 so it can be sold for $10 a share.
  
  So, if when SNAP goes bankrupt whom ever wrote you that contract is obligated to give you $1000 dollars, no ifs/ands/ or buts.

","The last sentence is correct but there are some errors in the rest of the explanation.

A long put gives you the right to put the stock to someone else, meaning sell it at the strike price. This is a $10 put so if SNAP goes to  $1, you would exercise the put, sell the stock for $10 and then buy it on the market for $1, netting $9 less whatever you paid for the put.  This all assumes that the markets are open for trading.

If the financial markets are shut down, I assume that contracts will still be exercisable during a shut down and even if not, the OCC exercises all options at expiration if they are one cent ITM which I also assume would still be done. There might be an issue with ability to sell the stock.

","There has been zero talk about cutting social security payments to people currently receiving payments.

There has been talk about cutting the taxes funding the social security system. The idea would be to make up the shortfall due to a tax cut by sending money from the general fund into the social security system. That plan has problems due to unemployed people not having to pay into the social security system, so a tax cut wouldn't put money into their pocket. They might need money to pay rent and buy food.

"Quoting wikipedia:


  On March 16, 2020, amid an economic crisis caused by the 2020
  coronavirus pandemic, for the first time since the inception of the
  Federal Reserve, the fractional reserve requirement was reduced to
  0%.[11]


Now question is why would banks not approve a loan? Worst case they get 0 $ back, but that does not mean that they lost money since credit was created out of thin air so even if every credit defaults they still will not loose any money and anything they get back is pure profit.

note:for simplification this assumes that cost of processing a loan is 0% for bank, we know that realistically they need to pay their employees.
","
  Worst case they get 0 $ back, but that does not mean that they lost money since credit was created out of thin air so even if every credit defaults they still will not loose any money and anything they get back is pure profit.


Obviously if a bank never lost money by not getting paid back they would make loans all day long, even ones they knew they would not get paid back on.

But the fact of the matter is, a bank's profits are based on how much they actually make on the loan beyond the cost of the loan itself.  The cost of the loan includes the principle which must be paid back.   What you refer to as being created ""out of thin air"" doesn't mean that money is being created from nothing, it is referring to the fact that the same money can be loaned out multiple times, effectively creating what appears to be actual money several times in excess of the actual amount of money floating around.

Another way of looking at it is that a bank generally isn't lending its own money.  They get the money from other sources and lend it out at higher rates than they pay, and from the excess the pay their expenses and hopefully have some profits left over.  So if you put $100 in an account at the bank, the bank can lend that $100 out and earn interest on the money, but at the end of the day, they still owe you $100 on demand whenever you ask for it.  The ""created out of thin air"" comes from the fact that the person who lends the money will need to put the money somewhere, most likely either the same or a different bank, or if they use the money to pay somebody else, that person most likely will deposit the same money in the bank, so ultimately, most of the money they lend out stays in the banking system where it can be lent out again.

The fractional reserve requirement just states how much of that money can be lent out again in the aggregate.  A 0% reserve requirement basically means the bank can lend it all out again.  It doesn't mean that they will be able to (only so much money in loans is being sought at any given time) nor does it reduce the fiduciary requirements to make good loans that are likely to get paid back.

"I'm researching options strategies and I started paper trading a $SPY options. Here's my strategy:

Set up a strangle 5% above and below the market price expiring a month from the day of trade. 12 contracts total. 

On Feb 20th, I looked at the cost of that setup:

Actual price of the stock ($SPY) = $336.40
Sell a Call 5% above the market (SPY200320C00355000) = $0.13 x 100 x 12 = + $156.00
Sell a Put 5% below the market (SPY200320P00319000) = $1.42 x 100 x 12 = + $1,704.00
So on Feb 20th, I would have received $1,860.00 for selling those options.


A month later, the idea is that one of those options would be worthless and the other one cheaper than the price paid (of course this was not the case with the current market/Covid-19)

On Mar 20th, I would have to pay back

Current price of the stock ($SPY) = $244.41
SPY200320C00355000 is now worth $0.01 = $12
SPY200320P00319000 is now worth $77.10 = $92,520.00


leaving me with a total of $ -90,660.00

Although it is clear that this strategy backfired given the current situation, I would like to understand if my calculations are right. 

More specifically, do I have to consider the fact that for every point that an index option goes beyond the strike, I will have to pay/earn $100? If this is the case, I would have to pay an additional 9,200 per contract (?), or $110,400

Since starting, I learned that an Iron Condor is much more secure than a Strangle and I'm planning to paper trade that strategy for a while.
","I think there's a few things you may be misunderstanding about selling a strangle. 

First: 


  A month later, the idea is that one of those options would be worthless and the other one cheaper than the price paid (of course this was not the case with the current market/Covid-19)


The ideal scenario behind selling a strangle is that both options expire OTM, as they were OTM when you sold them to begin with (in your example, on February 20th). This would result in you keeping all of the premium you initially received, the $1860.00 (not including commissions associated w/ selling these options, which can vary depending on your account, but we'll assume no commissions for the sake of the theoretical scenario). 

Second part: 


  More specifically, do I have to consider the fact that for every point that an index option goes beyond the strike, I will have to pay/earn $100? If this is the case, I would have to pay an additional 9,200 per contract (?), or $110,400


One, SPY isn't an index and if you wanted to sell options on an index, you could simply sell them on $SPX. Two, I think you're neglecting the fact that movements in the underlying are not the only factor that affects the value of an option, you also have time, and volatility (in a simplified sense) that affect the value of the option you sold. So you can't simply just use this rule of thumb without taking these into account, unless you're saying you are only concerned with what the price the option is on the day of expiration. In this scenario, then yes you'd be only concerned with the difference between the underlying, and the strike price of your option. 

So regarding the 319 Put that was sold at $1.42 a contract, then on the day of expiration (March 20th) this put would be worth $74.59 a contract, and in your example, this could either get exercised against you (if you let it) and in that case, you'd have to buy 100 * 12 = 1200 shares of SPY at $319.00 which would cost: 

$319.00 * 1200 = $382,800 and then your position is actually currently worth $244.41 * 1200 = $293,292 so your loss would be: 

$(293,292 - 382,800) + $1860 = $-87,648 (recall the $1860 in premium you received initially)

Or more commonly, you would have to buy back the option to close out the contract (since you sold to open the contract), which would cost: $74.59 * 100 * 12 = $89,508. Note that the call would expire OTM (worthless) and you don't have to buy it back. But, recall that you initially received $1,860.00 in premium when you sold these two contracts, so your total loss is: $87,648.

"Currently there are talks of issuing a $1000 payout to all American citizens earning less than $130,000. Presuming the final number of recepients is 200 million people, this is equivalent to injecting 200 billion dollars into the economy out of thin air. 

But of course money cannot be artificially increased without causing inflation, as demonstrated by the extreme example of Zimbabwe in the last decade. So how much value could the US dollar be expected to lose if the plan goes ahead?
","This is a question on the minds of just about everyone in the FX markets right now.  Unfortunately, there is no great answer.  It's sort of like asking if stocks are going to go up or down.  I'll list here the three big things that will determine the value of the USD in the medium term.  There are many others but I believe these to be the big ones.

(1) The decrease in economic activity as a result of the coronavirus should be strongly deflationary.  This can increase the amount of stuff that a dollar can buy because there isn't as much demand for the stuff.  So effectively the dollar strengthens.

(2) A flight to safety during time of stress where the USD is generally considered the safest currency.  The dollar has generally been strengthening against other currencies.  Part of this strengthening has been related though to the fact that a lot of borrowing happens in USD and when you borrow USD and then lose money you have to pay back the USD that you lost.  This has meant dollar buying, which has certainly contributed to the recent dollar strength.

(3) Stimulus/relief efforts on the part of the federal gov't to counteract the economic effects of the virus mean more debt to GDP.  Giving people money to spend like this in inflationary, which should reduce the value of the dollar.  The more debt you have relative to your ability to pay, then the more those lending to you should theoretically charge you in interest because you are a riskier borrower and less likely to make good on all of your payments. 

So we have two deflationary effects and one large inflationary effect.  The depth and length of the crisis will determine how much dollar ""strength""* we see from #1 and #2, and the gov't response to the depth and breadth of the crisis will determine #3.  They're intertwined.

*Here strength is relative to the price of goods and used in the deflationary sense of strength.

"I am in the process of making an offer for a house. Wife and I have about 135K saved, with steady jobs, both happen to be an 'essential business' as required for this period during the corona virus.

Initially, I wanted to put 20% down (about 74K) to avoid PMI and have lower monthly payments.

I have since reversed course on this. I think 10% (about 37K) is better, and here is my reasoning. PMI calculators online suggest the PMI will be about 150 a month. 37K invested returns should be more than double the yearly PMI payments during an average year. We plan on being in this house for the foreseeable future, so I am playing the long game with this chunk of investment. We can also have the option to make a chunk payment in the future to bring it to 20% equity and get the PMI taken off if we choose. Also, this gives us access to this cash in a more liquid form during these unsure times.

Does this reasoning make sense? With a long term outlook, would it still be wise to sink the extra 37K into the house and get rid of the PMI?
","Short answer: 
It probably makes sense to avoid the PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance), but it ultimately depends on how probable it is that you are unable to pay the monthly installments with/without the extra savings. 

Long answer:
While i am not an expert on the specifics of the US mortgage market (I presume the question pertains to US), it seems that a PMI (or an increment of the overall interest rate charged on the loan) varies between 0.5% and 2% p.a. and is charged on the overall loan amount (90% in this case). Your loan amount works out to 333k from the provided information and your annual PMI payment to 1800. This puts it on the lower end with 0.54%. 

That means that with the 37k you plan to invest instead of paying down, you have to earn 4.9% p.a. plus the normal mortgage interest rate on those 37k - all this net of tax (assuming you get no tax deduction on your mortgage/PMI payments). This seems like a tall order compared to a ""risk-free"" savings you realize by having a lower mortgage interest rate on the overall loan amount without the PMI. So based on risk/return considerations alone, you are probably better off avoiding the PMI. Only a very low PMI rate would result a different outcome from that perspective.

Another consideration to make is whether putting the 37k aside instead of using them for a down payment would improve your worst-case scenario and could buy you additional time in case you have difficulties repaying the mortgage. Only you can figure out how much this ""option"" is worth, considering how secure your and your spouse's incomes are, what are you going to do with the 61k that remain even if you choose to pay down  and how much the monthly mortgage repayment is, compared to your income. Based on the information you provided, it seems that the 61k can last you for a significant period of mortgage repayments, so that the value of any additional cushion is probably very small.

"Due to the covid-19 pandemic, the Federal government has decided to extend its tax filing and payment deadline to July 15th. So, if I were to file today, will I get my refund check in the mail this month or will I not get it until after July 15th? I'd like to get it sooner than latter (of course). I am within the United States. I plan to e-file through an online service like CreditKarma or TurboTax.
","Generally the IRS processes your return as soon as they can. So unless there is an issue that causes them to have to stop processing returns you will get your refund in a few weeks. It does depend on direct deposit vs paper check.

Usually each year they set a date in January or February when they will start processing returns, but if you file after that date they will get to them as quickly as possible.

People who are due a refund generally file early to get their money earlier. Those that owe tend to file at the last minute.

"So I am reading and listening to the news, watching the numbers re Covid-19, listening to and reading apocalyptic accounts of the coming recession, hearing of record breaking unemployment reports and then doubling those numbers the next week...

And the stock market goes down 1-2% and then stages a bit of a rally at the end of the day... (April 3)

I get that there has been a 20+% drop already, but it just seems to me that this doesn't account for the seriousness of the situation moving forward.

I am new to the trading/investing world (I've always been a buy-and-holder until a month ago when I saw the writing on the wall and got out when the markets were down just a few percent). But I'm just trying to figure out why there isn't more market movement downwards. Can somebody help me understand?
","Market reactions to information are not always timely, proportional, or rational. 

We don't know the full impact of our current situation; we're feeling it out.


Some people (bulls), believe that the initial dip was an over-reaction, that the government response will prevent further decline, and/or that things will go back to normal pretty quickly, so they are buying the dip.
On the other side you have people (bears) that believe the initial reaction was just a start but not enough to price-in the full impact, that the government can't prop up the economy, and/or that this will drag on for a long while, so they are betting on further decline. 


The problem with this idea of information being priced-in is that we all know there's a global pandemic, but there are very different opinions about how much that should affect the market.

Consider unemployment levels: We have projections about unemployment rate potentially hitting a peak over 30%. Meanwhile, the current unemployment rate is 4.4% and projected to hit double digits in April. The only way all of that information could be appropriately priced in is if everyone agreed about the reasonableness of the projections and had the economic prowess to understand the actual impact of those figures.

Instead, what happens is that some people will see the actual April unemployment numbers as surprising new information to react to, while others will see it as old information in line with their expectations. Add in thousands of other pieces of information about which people have conflicting opinions, and it becomes pretty much impossible to know in advance if that information was all priced in appropriately.

The most recent comparable event is the subprime mortgage crash. Many people thought bottom was hit around November 2008 and there was a brief counter-trend rally before actual bottom was hit around March 2009. We don't know at this time if the market has bottomed out yet or not; nor do we know how long recovery could take.

"We are a family of healthy people (30s/40s, kids in elementary/middle school). I've got an automatic contribution for my health savings account. The balance grows and grows. We've barely had a chance to spend any of it, aside from dental expenses.

Are there guidelines about how much one should aim to set aside for medical expenses? Are there actuarial figures about what medical expenses are likely to be, over a given period? (Obviously any of us could come down with a horrible chronic disease at any time, and drain the account. The ultimate decision will be balancing risk and opportunity cost, but as it stands I don't have any information about the risk.)
","There are few different things to consider:


Deductible : Since you have an HSA you are probably on a High Deductible insurance plan. Take a look at your HSA balance and divide by your max out of pocket deductible. That's the number of years you are covered for the ""worst case"" scenario. I'd say you want at least ten, but 100 years would be excessive. Depends of course on you own risk comfort.
Retirement : health care cost will likely be the single largest expense in retirement and unfortunately it's the hardest to predict and find good data on. A recent fidelity study put the average life time out-of-pocket cost for a couple into the $300.000 range. Other studies quote about $5000-$7000 in today's dollar per year per person on Medicare. Health Care inflation is currently significantly higher than regular inflation, which complicates the math further. Still, it's not unreasonable to have several hundred thousand dollars squirreled away for retirement health care
Coronavirus and shifts in the Health Care system: This is pure speculation at this point, but chances are that the current crisis will have an impact on the way Health Care works and gets paid for in the future. The most drastic change would be a single payer system (as many other countries in the civilized world already have) but it's very hard to predict how an HSA would roll over into this. One of the more plausible scenarios would be to allow a roll over into an IRA but that's all a wild guess at the moment. 
In any case the current system is stretched thin already. The average retiree  spends more than  40% of their social security income on health care and it is getting worse quickly.
Investment: HSA contributions are pre-tax money. In most cases that alone will outweigh any potential investment return. Assuming there is no high interest debt, I would recommend to first max out pre-tax retirement contributions, then pre-tax college savings and then pre-tax HSA. If you have other highly attractive investment vehicle you can consider those too. Stocks are cheap at the moment, although very risky and likely to be volatile for a while.


Looking at the actual medical risk is probably not that helpful. Statistics don't really help if it's just you and your family. Would you be doing anything differently if you knew the risk for a major health disaster is 0.1% instead of 0.2 % ?

"I'm looking at investing in some stock since the market is plummeting right now, particularly Airline stock because travel is way down due to coronavirus.  The idea is that if international travel is eventually halted to an almost standstill, the stock prices will be minuscule, then once coronavirus is mostly gone and travel starts again, I can sell my stocks for a profit.  Is this a good idea, or am I getting the idea wrong?  I've read that Airline stock is generally back.  Should I go with a market order or a limit order?
EDIT:  would shorting the stocks be a better option?
","Recently, travel, leisure, airline and cruise stocks have been punished by the coronavirus outbreak.

"There are lots of news headlines on 3/9/2020 that read like this:


  ""Saudi Oil Price Cut is a market shock""
  
  ""Oil price war threatens widespread collateral damage""
  
  ""low oil prices could damage the US economy""


However, in one of those articles, it also states things like this:


  Big importing nations could get some much needed relief from falling energy bills ... consumers benefit in general from lower oil prices ...


Shouldn't lower oil price lower the cost for lots of industries (except the oil/energy industry), stimulate the economy and as a consequence buoy the stock market? What am I missing here?
","There is a lot going on right now. Market volatility rose over the past 2 weeks on the news that Covid-19 cases are growing exponentially. It would be folly to try and correlate a large move on a particular day to other seemingly unrelated news. 

For that matter, in the midst of people trying to avoid crowds, many industries might suffer. Airlines, cruise ships, any function where large groups might gather. Say the payroll tax is briefly suspended. The $50K earner sees $70/wk more in their paycheck. Will that counter their desire to avoid the crowd? Airlines can't fill seats at any price. Where will that $70 go? Probably to pay the next rent or utility bill. Zero effect on the economy.

"I've recently purchased a vehicle and was planning on prepaying my auto insurance for the year up front rather than divided into monthly payments. 

Should I rather put some of that money to paying down more of the principal of the car loan , and pay auto insurance monthly increments as there is no interest associated with this?  I have an open-ended loan and I can pay lump sum payments towards principal at any time.

I'm also slightly worried about potential cash flow issues due to economic disruption of Covid-19.
","If there are no financial advantages to pre-paying your insurance, then your hypothesis is correct - it's probably in your best interest to pay the loan down with your cash now, and pay the insurance monthly.

But be sure to check on your insurance policy about payment terms - every policy I've ever had (granted, I'm in the US) has had a significant discount for pre-paying (the best has been on my current motorcycle policy, where I can save just more than 10% by prepaying). If your policy has such a discount, it may make sense to pre-pay the insurance instead.

If you do choose to make a lump sum payment on the car loan, it probably makes sense to actively communicate with your bank to make sure the payment is applied immediately to principal. Some banks may interpret lump sums as your intention to pre-pay the ""normal"" monthly payments, which essentially means some of the lump sum gets used towards interest, which is not in your favor.

"I came by some cash a year ago, so I put $20,000 in a Certificate of Deposit which will end this weekend (at about $20.5K). Now I'm wondering what to do with it. I don't really know much about investing, so I'm wondering what the most logical long-term move would be for me right now.


My bank currently has CDs from 6 months to 5 years, all at 0.75% interest.
But I've heard that investing in stock indexes is low risk over long periods of time. If I were to put this money in an index now (while the market is plummeting) would this be a smart way to start saving for retirement?
Or should I hold on to the cash and try to buy a rental property?
Or is there a fourth, smarter option?


Specific Goals [Edit]

I'm specifically looking for a low-risk, low-maintenance option that makes the most sense over a long period time (30 years-ish?). Stashing it away until retirement would be my first thought for the money, but I'm not sure if it might be smarter to keep it available just in case.

About me:

I'm in my 30s, living in the US. I don't own any property. I'm currently making below the poverty line, but I'm getting by. I have no debt. I have $2K in a savings account. I may be moving across the country for graduate school in a little over a year.
","If you don't expect to need the money for the next 30+ years, the best thing you can do is invest in the stock market.


The return on investment for CDs is abysmal.  They're only a good choice if you need absolute certainty that your investment won't lose value (or, won't lose value too quickly after adjusting for inflation).
Real estate is risky, particularly on the small scale.  A single stroke of bad luck can wipe out your entire investment.
The stock market is also risky, but unlike with real estate, you've got enough money to mitigate that risk by spreading your investment (eg. with a mutual fund, an index fund, or simply buying a wide variety of stocks).  Expect your investment to lose value in the near future -- the market is way down, but I don't think it's quite hit bottom yet, and long-term fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic will keep things unsettled for a year or more.

"COVID-19 has caused many large-caps' stocks to tumble like Spirit, Husky Energy ($2.75). Why don't they reverse stock split to uplift their share prices? Here are some benefits of unsplitting:


A high stock price can make the company look prestigious. E.g. A company trading at $1,000 per share will be perceived as more valuable even though the firm's market capitalization may be the same as a company whose shares trade at $50.
Share values mustn't fall too low! There have been cases where companies have split shares only to see the stock market dive, pushing shares below $10. Psychologically, this may turn off some shareholders, and in extreme cases, share prices may be too low for a company to be listed on an exchange. Companies will avoid splitting to protect themselves from this possibility. Doubtless large caps wouldn't fancy themselves dropping to being a penny stock!

","
  Why don't they reverse stock split to uplift their share prices?


Stock splits (and reverse-splits) are a zero-sum activity (minus what costs there are to actually implement the split). It's like trading 10 dimes for a dollar bill. The company is not worth any more or less after the fact. It used to be that a lower share price was desired since it would enable more investors that had to buy shares in 100-share lots. Nowadays, with index funds dominating the market, that benefit has largely gone away, which is why you see companies like Amazon and Apple decide not to split their shares that are worth hundreds or thousands of dollars per share. 

A reverse split may be required in order to stay listed on exchanges, but it often seen as a large negative signal, much like suspending a dividend. 

So companies have no financial incentive to split or reverse split, but often have behavioral incentives not to reverse split.

"I live &amp; work in the UK. A few weeks ago, I had a verbal offer accepted on a house (I am a first time buyer). I had initially offered a bit lower than the asking price, that offer was rejected, and I ended up offering the asking price- and asking the sellers to include some fixtures &amp; furnishings. This offer was accepted.

Since then, the coronavirus has broken out in the UK, and the markets have all dropped considerably (I was intending to put money saved in a Lifetime ISA toward the deposit- so this has obviously lost considerable value). Most things I've read are saying that we have no idea how long term the impact of the coronavirus will be on the financial markets, or whether it will impact the housing market in terms of house prices. Mortgage rates are already very low, so are unlikely to get any lower, particularly now that the Bank of England base rate has been dropped to 0.1%.

I'm unsure what to do regarding the offer I have put in on the house. I am not buying for any reason other than owning my own home, and to establish that for myself and my family. I am fortunate that my job is relatively secure- even if there were to be a recession, and even if I were to lose my job, I have a trade to fall back on which is still in a growth industry in the UK. My experience to date has been that it generally takes me between 1-2 months to apply, interview for &amp; receive an offer for a job.

So, given that I am not looking at the house for any reason other than to establish a home (i.e. it is not primarily a financial investment), should I contact the vendors to reduce my offer, given all the uncertainty going on at the moment?

If so, how would it be best to approach this, and how much should I reduce my offer by?
If not, why not?

Are there any other factors that I should be taking into consideration here?
If it makes a difference- there is no chain on the sellers' end, and I heard recently that they had also had an offer accepted, so was expecting to hear on completion dates relatively soon.
","You are proposing to gazunder. I can't speak for what might be 'best' for you personally, but I don't know of anyone who thinks this is a noble practice.

"Common advice given is that if you decide to become an active or passive investor, you should stick with the choice you've made. That you're less likely to be successful if you try to pursue both active and passive investing strategies.

But why is it a bad idea to combine both strategies?  For example, passively invest in index funds, but when an opportunity arises where it seems that you'll make a lot of money by actively trading, go with that strategy instead? For example with recent events, people are betting heavily against the S&amp;P500, as we're still in the beginning stages of the coronavirus pandemic as of this writing.
","
Common advice given is that if you decide to become an active or passive investor, you should stick with the choice you've made.


No you shouldn't. It is perfectly fine to supplement an active portfolio by passive index funds, or to supplement an index fund portfolio with several carefully chosen stocks.

What is bad advice is to buy lots of various active funds (leading to index returns, because there are so many of the active funds, without low costs of index investing). If you believe in active investing, you should select only a fund or at most two in the same market, having fund managers you can trust.

What is also bad advice is to buy quasi-active funds, funds that claim to be active but don't really take any active risk because the fund manager fears losing to the index return. In this case, too, you pay for active management but get passive returns.

Let me propose a case where you could supplement an index portfolio with some actively chosen stocks. If you, for example, like traveling a lot more than most people. Unfortunately, traveling uses oil, so it might be a good idea to buy stocks of oil companies. Traveling also requires aeroplanes, so it might be a good idea to buy aeroplane manufacturer stocks. You of course travel with an airline, so it might be a good idea to buy airliner stocks.

Or, if you drive a lot with an electric car. In this case, it might be a good idea to supplement your index portfolio with stocks of Tesla and electric utility companies, especially those that produce electricity with fixed cost structure like hydropower or nuclear power.

Let me also propose a case where you could supplement an active portfolio with some index funds: you run out of ideas. Simply said. You have so much money to invest but you can't find any companies where you would like to increase your ownership. In this case, it's perfectly fine to buy index funds. Or, you could hire a monkey to throw darts into a list of stocks to select new investments for you. But it's much simpler to buy index funds than to hire a dart-throwing monkey.

"In light of the Covid-19 crisis, my country's banks have seen their shares' prices drop. Last week, the banks announced that they will doing a share buyback, and this week, the prices of the shares have increased...

Is there any reason why the banks are buying their own shares at a crisis like this? 
","Assume there is a corporation that makes spoons, with $10M in cash. Its single factory is already pumping out as many spoons as it can. There is also no need to open a new factory, because our market research team has determined that no one will buy the new spoons from the new factory. Our R&amp;D team doesn't know how to make anything but spoons.

So, what does the company do with the cash? It could (1) sit on it, and earn basically nothing. Or it could (2) invest it in something completely unrelated to the spoon business. Or, it could (3) send it back to the shareholders. Let's look at each option:

(1) If the company just keeps the cash in the bank account, then it will earn basically no interest, and the investors who own shares in the corporation will be unhappy to get such little returns on corporate assets. If they wanted to have a low-risk cash portfolio, they would do that with their own money, they wouldn't want their spoon-making-investment to make that decision for them.

(2) If the company invests in non-spoon related things, then perhaps it will get into trouble by making foolish business decisions. Buying a fork-making factory could lead to trouble - why what if our spoon scientists forget to make the tines, and just makes the whole thing rounded, based on what worked for them in spoon making?? Again, if a company steps outside of its area of expertise, it is deciding, on behalf of its shareholders, to diversify its portfolio. But the shareholders could make that decision themselves, and doesn't necessarily want the corporation to make this decision. Note that some companies do successfully diversify, but it is typically part of an overarching plan that makes sense together, or else it often fails.

(3) If the company returns the cash to the shareholders they can decide for themselves what to do with the cash. Some will invest in low-risk things like government bonds or simple savings accounts earning minimal interest. Some will invest in competing spoon-makers, and some might invest in new fork-making ventures. But the decision on how to invest goes back to the individual shareholders.

Buying back stock is just one way to get money back to shareholders. The other common way would be to pay out a dividend. In financial theory, there are basically 3 differences between a share buy-back and a dividend: (A) A buyback is optional, meaning only the shareholders looking to sell their shares, will have shares bought by the company; (B) A buyback happens relative to the current share price in the market, meaning that part of the decision to make a buyback could be based on whether the company believes itself to be undervalued; and (C) the tax implications are different [In general, most countries tax capital gains on selling your shares, at a lower rate than corporate dividends].

So, why would a bank do a share buyback right now? Probably because interest rates are at a historic low, meaning that the bank has a limited ability to invest its capital to earn what it feels are good returns. So instead, it is leaving the choice to its shareholders how to invest - and because the bank probably feels its shares are undervalued, it is preferential to do this instead of paying a dividend. For the shareholders who remain in the company, the increase in share price is an indication that the decision made by the bank was one that benefited them.

Quick note on the political aspect hinted at here: The main reason it is contentious to do a share buy-back in times like this, is that a government could give a stimulus package to a business, with the goal of having that business invest in itself, hire workers, etc.; if instead of investing in itself it just pays out the cash to shareholders, the government has effectively 'bailed out' the relatively wealthy individuals who own shares, rather than the working class who they were attempting to get jobs for.

"I am having a rather confusing financial situation. A the moment, I am having around 1200 euros a month on savings. I have the emergency fund already set up. The only huge debt i have that i need to take care off is my car which I am planning to pay it off in july next year. CoVid19 situation does not hinder my job as its deemed necessary by my company and hence I will be having a steady cash flow. 

I am looking for a better investment scenario , as I would like to invest this money but would need to cash out the next year to pay the debt off for car. It is possible for me to risk the loss upto 20% of my total investment. I normally follow a value investment strategy and long term holding. I am also interested in REITs but in general in order to cash out from REIT, one must do that an year advance to liquidate and hence i believe this does not suit my situation.  So none of the strategies that I know are helpful here. Is there any specific investment that i can make during this year which gives me flexibility to invest my money ? 

I am not really satisfied in leaving the money in the bank account doing nothing as I live in Germany and the interest on savings accounts are  as low as zero and is not much helpful.
","If you can lose 20% and still make the balloon  payment then only risk the 20%. Based on your question you can set aside 1,200 a month for the next 15 months. Since 20% of 15 months is 3 months take the next three months payments and invest it in a ETF or mutual fund. The remaining 12 months keep it safe in a bank or CD.

You can do this because you already have an emergency fund, and you believe your job is secure. If you didn't have the emergency fund you would send the extra amount there. If you were worried about your job you wouldn't want to tie up money you might need soon. 

Of course if you can save interest by making the balloon payment early, I would wait until the last 3 months to invest, and make the balloon payment as soon as possible or even make a larger monthly payment.

"During Covid19 pandemic I managed to save some money and I was thinking about repaying some of my debts, however, I'm not sure should I do it, or keep cash just in case things turn for the worse. This is my situation with concerns against repaying each debt.

I have roughly 7000 GBP

I have three debts:


6500 GBP overdraft (APR 35%)  
2500 GBP PayPal credit (APR 19.9%) 
1600 GBP Amex credit card (APR 23.5%)


I could repay my overdraft, it would save me around 150 GBP each month and I could still use it as if money would be in my bank account in case of a real emergency.

I could repay both PayPal and Amex cards saving around 120 GBP each month and have some money left. My concern is that PayPal Credit and Amex are the least acceptable forms of payment in the UK and in case I would need access to money there is a chance I won't be able to use.

I can just keep the cash and pay interest on all three accounts until crisis is over.

What should i do?
","Keeping some liquid cash is sensible, but the exorbitant rates on your debt will hurt you long-term. Pay them off as quickly as safely possible.

Since you have high-interest debt, getting rid of that debt is more important than maintaining a large emergency fund. Having both savings and overdraft fees is illogical. However, I understand that you'd rather have cash than paying of other debts if you expect to be laid off soon.

To save the most money, the optimal solution is to pay off the highest-interest debt first. Here, that is the overdraft.

Unless you will also be able to pay off the other debts within a couple of months, it could be sensible to refinance. A small loan for £5000 at 6% over 12 months (~ £440/month) could give you breathing room to pay off all high-interest debts and stabilize your finances – if you are still eligible for such loans.

Aside from affecting job stability, the Covid-19 situation doesn't change a lot. If you've struggled to live without debt pre-Corona, it won't get easier now. That's why it could be helpful to pay off as much as possible now, so that you aren't saddled with endless interest payments in more difficult times: who knows how long this crisis will last? And you need to figure out why you have so much cash and so much debt, but that is out of scope here.

"Covid-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has now been around since 3 months. European stock markets have crashed very hard, US-stock market has crashed hard, but the Chinese Stock market on the other hand seems to have not been affected by the whole thing at all.

Hangseng Index (02.12.2019 - 31.03.2020): -10,74 %

","Good question, here are 2 (among many) possible answers: 


The Chinese Government seems to manage the stock market directly at times. I.e. There are stories (like the one above) where the governments doesn't allow funds or brokers to sell. That level of control likely wouldn't happen in the USA.

"I've always lived with family and been a student, so apart from odd jobs here and there I've never really worked full time or reached a minimum taxable threshold of income. On top of this, I am currently overseas. What I'm wondering is, am I still eligible to receive a Covid19 stimulus check?
","If you have not (and will not) file your taxes for 2018 or 2019 then the only way to receive the check is to file for 2020 next spring. The check is actually an advance on a 2020 tax credit, so you can take it now or later.

However, for this year you have until July 15 to file your 2019 taxes. Even if you have $200 in income for the year, might as well file so you get the stimulus check sooner.

Note that if you are a dependent on someone else's return then you are not eligible for the stimulus check.

","You choosing to remove her as your dependent, or you choosing to not have claimed her as your dependent in the first place when you filed, will not allow her to get the stimulus payment. The restriction is that she cannot get the stimulus payment if she can be claimed by somebody else as a dependent, not that she actually was claimed by somebody else as a dependent. The fact that you have a choice to claim her as your dependent or not, implies that she can be claimed by you as a dependent (i.e. she meets the conditions in the law to qualify as your dependent). In that case, she cannot get the stimulus payment, even if you do not actually claim her as a dependent on your tax return.

"I've gone sale agreed (note: ""sale agreed"" means the sale has been agreed in principle - no contracts have been signed, no non-refundable deposits have been made etc.) on a house. The market I'm currently in was extremely competitive, houses were all generally going for significantly more than their asking price, as mine did.

I have nearly everything ready - loan arranged, survey of the house completed, solicitor ready to sign everything.

Now with Covid, a recession is more than likely coming our way.

Furthermore, with lock-downs in place - the seller is extremely unlikely to find an alternative buyer in the near future (it's an executor sale if that makes any difference).

I was thinking of trying to put some pressure onto the seller to lower the agreed price.

While I don't want to lose the house (and the money we have spent so far on legal etc.), I would also like to take advantage of potentially lower mortgage repayments.

Is it a bad idea to put this to the estate agent and be forthright about exactly why I'm asking to lower the price? Is there a ""reasonable"" amount to lower the purchase price by?

Edit

My intention here isn't to ""screw"" the seller as several commentators assume that I am trying to do.

At the end of the day, I'm a first time buyer who has effectively agreed to buy a house at ""peak"" economic health. Within a couple of weeks of this agreement, economic impacts of covid-19 were already being felt and the short / medium term prospects are not good.

At the end of this year, if covid hasn't wreaked enough havoc, there is a very real risk that Brexit could have an extremely negative impact on my country.

So while the honorable thing to do might be to commit to the agreed purchase price, this might be an extremely unwise decision from a personal finance point of view.

""Why don't you just pull out of the sale then?"" 

I could do that, that leaves the seller in a very bad position as well - it will be extremely unlikely they will be able to find another buyer in the short / medium term - so giving them an opportunity to consider my concerns might be better than simply walking away.
","You could ask, but you risk the seller deciding to just cancel and put the property back on the market once restrictions lift, shutting you out. Depending on the exact neighborhood and local market, there is no guarantee that a recession will even affect the chosen neighborhood. You described it as a very competitive, presumably it will still be a desirable neighborhood even in a recession and you didn't mention how vulnerable the local economy is to a recession.

Google: 1530$ before the crises. now at 1100$ --> -28%
Amazon: 2170$ before the crises. now at 1910$ --> -12%
Microsoft: 190$ before the crises. now at 152$ --> -20%


My  assumption is that Amazon is more resisting because delivery services are very popular during these days. However, cannot see why Microsoft is more resilient compared to Google. 
","There may not be one definitive reason, but I'll throw out one possibility.  Many employees are working form home these days, so cloud services like Teams, Skype, and Office are seeing increased usage since the pandemic began.  Teams alone saw a 700% increase in usage during a one-month period in Italy. 

Amazon is probably also benefiting from web services, but I would presume that online shopping is helping more than that.

What are the reasons not to cash out our 401k? In my opinion, my would greatly benefit to have this money in real estate or other investments. We have already saved up about a $150k for a house down payment, and having $100k more would allow us to buy a house in our area outright or with a very small mortgage. Alternatively, we could put it into the S&amp;P500 or Tbills, etc.

By ""other investments"" I mean something like a Roth IRA, which can be invested in similar stuff but with better long term tax implications.

"2019 taxes i was filed as an adult dependant for the first tims in 15 years. I have every other year filed my own taxes. Will I qualify for a stimulus check or a $1200 refundable credit on my 2020 taxes? In 2018 i filed my own taxes and could not be claimed as a dependent. I don't understand why I would be excluded since they have said they would go by a person's 2018 return if they have not yet filed for 2019. People who made too much money in 2019 and have not yet filed for 2019 are using their AGI on their 2018 returns to qualify.
","First off, you are correct, the IRS will use 2019 data first, and then 2018 data if that is not available. However, you were put down on someone else's return for 2019 so you have technically filed. Therefore they will not look at 2018 and you will not get the stimulus check in April 2020.

The only way you will get the stimulus is if you file independently for 2020 and no one is able to claim you as a dependent. Note that it does not depend on whether you get claimed or not. If someone could claim you, you are not eligible for the stimulus, even if they don't actually claim you.

The person claiming you for 2019 will also not get the $500 for dependents since you are not a child under 17 years of age.

"I am not much of a movie watcher, so I'm not looking at Amazon much to rent/stream movies.

A friend told me that Amazon just jacked up the price on first-run movies like Emma and The Invisible Man to $19.99 after the theaters started closing. I looked, and that's the current price.

But was Amazon renting first-run movies in the $4-$6 range prior to this? It seems unlikely to me, but I thought I'd ask.
","You couldn’t rent first-run movies through Amazon before COVID-19 shut theaters.

Amazon would rent movies that had already hit the rental market for between $2.99 and $5.99, depending on how recently the movie was in theaters. I just checked, Amazon still charges $5.99 for Parasite, the exact same amount I paid when I rented it through them 6 weeks ago. 

With theaters closing, the big studios still wanted a way to show their movies, so they brought them to the rental market sooner and they’re charging substantially more because the movie should still be in theaters and charged $19.99 to stay closer to movie ticket prices. (They may have some data that says something like 1.8 people on average watch a movie streamed through Amazon, and that’s why they charge more than the price of 1 ticket, but I don’t know for sure.)

Rumors of being engineered.
Similar Symptoms of high fever, dry cough, respiratory issues.
Airborne and community spread.


Consequences of those being,


Curfew and lockdown of major cities around the world.
Canceling of International flights.

Precautionary measures taken are,


Social distancing.
Hand washing frequently.
Quarantine and no handshaking.

","No, it's not about Coronavirus.  Neither is ""The Eyes Of Darkness"" by Dean R Koontz.  Coronavirus is actually a fairly well-known virus that has been around for quite some time.  The CDC defines it as:


  Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness
  ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle
  East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory
  Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that
  has not been previously identified in humans.  
  
  Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between
  animals and people.  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was
  transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary
  camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in
  animals that have not yet infected humans.


It's not uncommon to have a virus be very widespread and infect humans via an animal host.  AIDS is also a virus which is believed to have spawned from animal to human contact.

"Due to COVID 19, WWE is hosting their shows with no audience. How does WWE earn money with an empty audience?
","BusinessInsider.com reported on this in an article back in 2015. The statistics were culled from major North American sports teams.


  The amount of revenue generated by major North American sports team from the selling of media rights (TV, radio, internet, etc.) is projected to surpass the amount of revenue generated from ticket sales in 2018, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers report (via Sports Business Daily). As a result, television ratings have now become the driving force behind sports, even bigger than actually bringing fans to the games.&nbsp;&nbsp;source: Why TV ratings in sports are more important than attendance - Nov 17, 2015

"I adopted two middle-aged (or older?) cats from the same shelter 3.5 years ago.  Both were healthy until recently when one developed FIP.  Since I adopted them they have had no contact with other cats, aside from whatever happens behind the scenes at the vet's office.

According to this article from the Cornell Veterinary School, a cat can be exposed to the virus (with no symptoms) and develop FIP years later.  So it sounds like it's possible that my cat came to me already infected and the disease only manifested now.  (It's also possible that the other cat is a carrier who transmitted it to him without getting sick himself.)

When is a cat with future-FIP infectious?  Only during an initial exposure to coronavirus (when my cat caught this), or from that time onward?  Only after developing FIP?  If a cat has been exposed to coronavirus in the past but has never shown symptoms of FIP, can he transmit that coronavirus to other cats?

I am trying to figure out the effect of this on my remaining cat, and whether I can safely adopt another cat to join him.  There is no reliable test for FIP other than biopsies, so at best testing can tell us if he's been exposed to coronavirus (the test looks for the antibodies). But my biggest concern is whether he could be infectious.  (If he's also infected then, sadly, there's nothing we can do about that.  We can only test for coronavirus and coronavirus doesn't always lead to FIP from what I've read.)
","Veterinary partner is a very reliable website that should be able to answer your questions on FIP

Your cat wont get FIP by being with an FIP + cat, it can however contract coronavirus. And yes as you mentioned, not all coronavirus cats will develop FIP.

From my ""Common Diseases of Companion Animals"" textbook:


  80% to 90% of cats in catteries have antibodies to FECV and these cats shed virus intermittently.


That being said by continuously disinfecting and only having one/two cat(s) in your home you can eventually clear out FECV (most common household disinfectants work).

You can check your current cat what his current anti-body levels are for coronavirus if you're concerned about a new cat coming in as well.

An excerpt from veterinary partner on FECV:


  An active infection lasts several weeks to a few months. Virus is shed in the infected cat’s stool during this period. If the cat is reinfected, virus sheds again for weeks to months. During this time, the cat may or may not seems at all ill. Some infected cats do not shed virus.
  
  The mutation to a form of virus that can cause FIP is more likely to occur in an immune-compromised cat. Most cats with FIP are less than one year old (their immaturity is their immune compromise). Crowding is also an important source of immune-compromise. Another important factor in mutation is multiple exposure/infections. When cats keep getting reinfected, the virus they carry has more chance of mutating to a form that causes FIP.


I've only seen 3 cases of FIP in almost 4 years in practice, it's not very common.

"Most countries seem to allow dog walking during anti-COVID-19 measures preventing the spread of the coronavirus. However, there's at least South Africa where even dog walking is disallowed. The extent to which it's disallowed is a bit unclear, but the wording from the news suggest that dog owners are supposed to not get out of their houses unless they ""really want to"":


  Dog lovers in South Africa have been ordered not to take their beloved pets for a walk for three weeks, Police Minister Bheki Cele said at a news conference.
  
  “We had discussions and agreed that there shall be no walking of dogs,” Cele said. “If you really want to walk your dog, do it around your house – it ends there.”
  
  (source)


Currently there's only South Africa with a limitation like this, but nothing stops other countries from applying the same restrictions if the spread of COVID-19 can't be stopped.

How are owners supposed to take care of their dog's toilet needs if dog walking is disallowed? Is there some sensible way, or are they supposed to wait for dogs to make a mess and then clean up? (I'd probably rely on the ""really want to"" case myself, but it seems to be considered an exception by those imposing the restriction.)
","Dogs - like humans - usually choose a certain place as their ""bathroom"" to do their business there. As long as the poop doesn't pile up without ever disappearing, they will stick to this bathroom.

If your dog is toilet trained, it learned that the bathroom is somewhere outside and never in the house. If you really lock it up inside there are 2 consequences:


Your dog will hold its pee and poop as long as possible, because it cannot go to the bathroom. That is very uncomfortable and can have negative effects on the health.
Sooner or later, your dog has to make a mess, every single day. It'll learn that the toilet is now inside the house and it will be extremely hard to stop this behavior again if the covid-19 crisis is over.


So my best advice is: Go outside for your dogs toiletry needs, no matter what your government says.

The quote implies that your government is very aware that it's impossible to lock dogs inside the house.


  “If you really want to walk your dog, do it around your house – it ends there.”


If you don't have a yard where your dog can do its business, you have a reason to ""really want to walk your dog"". But please stick to the streets / walkways closest to your home and don't wander through half the city into a crouded dog park. If one round around the house isn't enough for your dog, walk 2 or 3 rounds around the house, but do stay close to the house.

"My 5 year old cat has a small wound on the back of it's head for a about two weeks. The wound has an approximate length of 1/4 inch (6mm) and does not seem to grow.

What worries me, is that the wound is not closing. Normally these close very fast, but this does not seem to close.

He does not seem to be in pain and is not scratching the wound often. He is also feeding normally.

Because of the current COVID19 Situation it's hard for me to visit a vet.

Is there anything I can do? Do I need to visit the vet?


","Please be aware that I'm not a vet.

To me the wound doesn't look bad. It's small enough to not require stitches and it doesn't look inflamed or infected.

My own cat got lost for a long time and came back with a severe case of ear mites, which caused him to scratch himself raw around the ears. Even after treatment for the mites, it took several months (!) for his skin to heal completely. 

Such superficial wounds tend to scab, which itches and can pull on hairs. Our cat often scratched parts of the scab off, which looked very much like the photo of your cat.

I think you don't even need to put a ""collar of shame"" on him. Just keep an eye on the wound and avoid touching it, which might irritate him and cause more scratching.

"We are adopting a new (rescue) cat next weekend. The rescue that we are getting him from recommends a 7-10 day isolation period before we introduce him to our current cats to make sure that he isn't ill and doesn't transmit any illnesses to our other cats.

What illnesses and/or illness symptoms should I be on the lookout for?

Part of the recommended integration period also recommends taking bedding that smells like him and putting it where our other cats can smell it and vice versa (so they can smell each other before meeting). Should I wait to do this until after the isolation period, or a certain number of days through the isolation period to make sure that he doesn't have a skin disease?

Finally (out of curiosity), I have medical records on our new cat for the past month (his second worming is tomorrow, he's had FeL/FIV testing, etc). If this was a stray cat off the street, would the isolation period be longer/different?
","This is a bit late, but for others doing the same. The main things to monitor in new/stray cats are appetite, vomition, lethargy, runny poops, struggling or inability to urinate and breathing and eye problems. Common diseases/conditions that hit suddenly includes Feline Herpiesvirus (eyes, mouth, lungs), Feline Corona virus (appetite, diarrhoea), stress (urination problems).

As a stray you unfortunately don't know the history and diseases like Feline Leukaemia (FeLV) and Feline Aids (FIV) is a definitely a possibility, even if they are vaccinated, but for example not tested. These diseases can take months to show clinical signs (weight loss, inappetance, lethargy, fever, other diseases, etc. etc.)

"My indoor cat has a (rotating) variety of toys, things to climb on and scratch, and places to run around; I'm not concerned about him getting enough physical stimulation.  But I've heard that cats also need mental stimulation.  How do I best provide that, both when I'm playing with him and when he's alone in the house?  I know that there are ""puzzle toys"" that reward solving the puzzle by dispensing kibble or treats, but I'd rather not have that happening all over the house (especially where any missed kibbles could be ground into rugs).  What other options do I have for exercising his mind as well as his body?

The cat is probably 12 or 13 years old.  Getting another cat isn't an option right now because of disease-transmission concerns.  Other than being a carrier for something I'd rather not spread (coronavirus), my cat is healthy.
","From what I've observed with cats, they tend to provide their own mental stimulation in the form of role-play.  I've seen cats quiver with anticipation at the thought of jumping onto inanimate pieces of fluff.  I've seen then dance around in imaginary play-fights with their toys.

Cats also include the environment in their role-playing.  They'll creep around furniture to sneak up and attack an unsuspecting table tennis ball, crawl behind a sofa to lie in wait.

So you could try moving items of their environment to allow them to explore the house in different ways.  Not large pieces of furniture (although you could if you wanted to), smaller items like side tables and foot-stools might provide some variety.

"I have two male cats, both are stray which decided to live in my house this past year. 
one cat is less than a year, 10 months perhaps, and other is probably older than 2 years, both are not neutered yet. 

i want to neuter them, but I'm scared with the risks. 

I'm scared because I had a cat suspected with FIP before they came. They have been exposed with the FIP cat for 2 months, but they never share litter box. 

Now the FIP cat had been gone for three months already, and the other two cats are still healthy and active. I want them to be neuter, but I'm afraid the stress caused by neuter surgery will lead them to develop FIP, according to many articles, spaying/neutering is included as stressor that might lead to coronavirus mutation. 

Since we are in pandemic era of covid-19, is it possible that might be FCoV also in outbreak? I have seen another cat near my house that has developed the same nervous system symptom of FIP. 

I wonder if i should delay or never neuter my cat at all. 

I know i might be sounds overstretched and paranoid, but it's true, I'm really scared, that's why i put the question here. 

I live in a country where testing body titer of certain virus in cat is available for public due to the lack of development of veterinary
","Even if your cat is infected with FIP, the neutering is safe to do. I have had this done to a feral cat I had a couple of years ago (actually it was done at the same time as a tooth was extracted as a result of FIP).

I cannot answer how safe it is to spay a female cat that has FIP, but I do not think the risk is significantly elevated in female cats.

"My cat (approximately 16 years old, short hair, no specific breed, indoor cat) has been vomiting pretty much every day (sometimes multiple times) for almost a month.

She had a scare with her kidneys about 2 years ago (elevated results of urea and creatine) and has had blood tests regularly since but her levels fell and have been good ever since.

Her brother passed away a few years ago from stomach cancer, and he showed similar symptoms in the beginning but when we've taken her to the vets they've done X-Ray and ultrasound and other than a slight thickening of the stomach lining couldn't see any lumps or anything out of the ordinary. She has also had blood tests and everything looks fine, very good kidney results, no sign of liver issues, no sign of diabetes.

She's been on antacids and laxatives from the vet (as much as we can get in her, she's not good with meds and gets very distressed) but they don't seem to be having any effect.
When she's been in to the vets they sometimes give her an anti-nausea injection which stops her being ill for a few days and then it starts up again.
She's also had antibiotics, dewormer, B12 and a steroid injection at various times. Any improvement is only temporary for a few days and then she starts vomiting again.

She's a fussy eater and she gets dry food (Purina One, various flavours), tuna and white fish. Also occasionally ham. She won't eat much else. She gets sick mostly in the morning and we suspected Bilious Vomiting Syndrome, but she already has food down through the day and gets other regular food throughout the day too, including late at night and that hasn't improved anything.

Most days she might be sick once (and it tends to be thick and dark brown, occasionally with food in or clumps of hair but mostly liquid) but sometimes it's two or three times.
She's otherwise eating fine, drinking and urinating a normal amount and pooing regularly (not sure the laxative is making any difference).

The vets seem to be a bit stumped and just keep telling us to give her the laxatives / antacid but there's obviously something else going on.

The only major change recently is that we were giving her a glycosamine and mineral supplement for arthritis which we were mixing with milk to get her to take it as it was the only way to guarantee she'd take it all. We ran out of the first course a couple of weeks before she started getting sick and didn't get any more before she got ill, so it's been about six weeks since she had the supplement or any milk.

We're really worried but don't know what else to do. Everything is also complicated by the fact we're in the UK and the country is on lockdown because of Coronavirus so while the vet is still open it's not easy to get an appointment.

We're waiting on a stronger antacid from the vets and we're going to try to give her exclusively white fish for a few days to see if diet is contributing (but it's the same diet she's been on for years).

Any ideas what it could be or what we could try next?
The fact she seems to be in good health (particularly for her age) is what's confusing us as all the things we've seen that fit have a list of other symptoms that she just hasn't got.
","NEVER GIVE YOUR CAT MILK cats and all other adult mamals are unable to digest lactose it makes them and many of us ill.

The negative effect of giving milk is most likely stronger than the positive effect of glycosamine and the mineral suplement.

As elmy say in her answer if the vomit is dark it might be internal bleeding so you will need to take your cat to the vet for diagnosing and treatment of this.

Giving white fish is a good idea and you can use the juice from the white fish and mix glycosamine and mineral suplement into this,to get the juice out of the white fish you need to do as follows.

Use one of your smallest pots add the white fish(it is best if it have been frozen)add a couple of spoons of water and slowly heat until the water boils,use a fork to split up the fish so it gets heated evenly use little heat you need to keep the water/juice.

You can use a strainer to remove the juice or you can use the fish and juice as it is,cool it down and mix in the glycosamine and minerals hopefully your cat will eat it.

As other mention in the comments giving only white fish over time is not good,and it will lead to lack of essensial nutrients so you need to go back to normal food after two days even if your cat manages to keep the food down.

"My cat has been on Royal Canin Feline Urinary SO dry food for a couple of years. However recently Royal Canin changed the formula for that food and it is making cats puke. All reviews starting January 2020 have pet owners reporting this problem.

Since he is still growing, I had to weigh him on the bathroom scales so the vet could prescribe the right doze. Another time, I called for medical advice that the person at the front desk was able to answer.

"Like many, I and my family are stuck indoors for the duration of Covid-19.  I would like to try growing plants on the available windowsills, preferably edible plants.

However, I've no ideas for what would practically work.  What can grow, just on a window sill, in a plot, and be useful?  Location is UK, SSE facing.
","Most edible plants need a lot of sun, so you might struggle to get any sort of a crop. Best thing is to regard it as a fun experiment, rather than a way to feed the family. If possible, when it gets warmer (?), stand the plants outside on an external window ledge for extra light. Don't let the compost dry out. As with growing any fruit or veg, (1) only  grow things you like, and (2) grow for taste. You could try herbs (basil, parsley, etc), cress, leaf salad. Not sure if new potatoes would work, but worth a try if you have the room. Personally, if I was going to try one thing on my windowsill it would be ""Gardener's Delight"" tomatoes. They're small and exceedingly tasty. I grew them for years down my allotment until I was beaten by tomato blight.

The man who installed the system left a tube specifically for this purpose, and today I unearthed it; the problem is that I don't know the name of the connector I need, and also I was unable to remove the cap that is closing the tube.

I don't want to apply excessive force to avoid breaking the tube. I tried unscrewing the black part from the blue one, turning the cap counterclockwise.

Is this the right way to do it? Is the cap simply stuck since it was buried for two years? Do I need special tools or would a couple of wrenches do the trick?

Due to an extremely similar scene present in the episode and to avoid relation to the axe murder, TV Kanagawa replaced it with a half hour of unrelated scenery with “Air on a G String” playing in the background. Among the shock and rage expressed among fans, a 4chan user commented “Nice Boat”, referring to the Norwegian ferry shown in the replacement footage. Immediately the phrase became a meme, however is far more popular in Japan than in English speaking countries.




The part with the boat is easily viewable on Youtube and other sites, but I haven't been able to find the full episode.

Is the episode bundled together with any merchandise or available legally online to stream/download?
","The full 28-minute version of Nice Boat is apparently available on Nicovideo (you'll need to make an account or use a redirector like nicoviewer). I didn't see the original Nice Boat back when it aired, so I can't say whether it's the real deal, but it certainly looks right to me. The Nice Boat itself makes its first appearance at 04:36. 

I would be surprised if Nice Boat were ever included in a home video release of School Days, though. At minimum, it's not included in the French DVD boxset or in the 2013 Japanese Blu-ray boxset.

"If you watch just the first episodes, it is a ordinary Mahou Shoujo for tween girls anime...

But the plot thickens into something too heavy for young girls to digest (imo) soon enough.


   The whole dismemberment and viewing themselves as living sacrifices for their god, not to mention the sisterly guilt trip.


With that in mind, where does it fall?
","The light novel Washio Sumi wa Yūsha de Aru, which is set in the same universe 2 years prior and is the prequel of the anime, targets the seinen demographic. The seinen demographic includes males from 17 years of age and above. It can be safe to assume that the anime Yūki Yūna wa Yūsha de Aru is for the same demographic as the light novel.

The show is also broadcast at late night on the primary channel MBS and other channels, at as early as 22:00 and as late as 03:00 late night. The late night showing of the anime implies that it is at least for young adults and not for tween girls as the introduction might have suggests.

Why is COVID-19 prioritized over other infectious diseases?

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak - WHO



On 2020.01.30, the Director-General of Emergency Committee convened by the WHO declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV (2019 Novel Coronavirus) constitutes a PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern).

Actions by country/region:

Hong Kong declares coronavirus emergency. (2020.01.25)

Italy declares state of emergency over coronavirus. (2020.01.31)

U.S.A declared a public health emergency (PHE). (2020.01.31)

South Korea raised threat alert to the highest level. (2020.02.23)

Some provinces of China lower emergency response as epidemic slows. (2020.02.26)

My question:

What are the consequences of PHEIC, to China and to other countries?


","tl;dr: There aren't any tangible consequences, unless China or other countries decide to take any.



The World Health Organization is an agency of the United Nations. But it does not have any legislative powers. Its activities are limited to spending its budget on funding health-related research, spreading health information and funding healthcare projects which operate within the legal framework of the countries they operate in. 

It might advise governments to take actions, like for example fund healthcare measures, discourage/promote products depending on their health impact, enact quarantines or discourage/promote certain medical procedures. But it does not have the authority to enforce any of those measures themselves.

Now what exactly does it mean that the WHO declares a public health emergency of international concern? It is basically just a declaration, stating that the WHO believes that this is a problem people should take seriously. The WHO has done that 5 times before, each time in case of a global outbreak of an acute infectious disease:


2009 (Swine Flu)
2014 (Polio)
2014 (Ebola)
2016 (Zika)
2019 (Kivu Ebola)

"
"The COVID-19 outbreak has been dominating the news recently, with loads of headlines and efforts being made to stop it from spreading.

Why this disease? It's not one of the most lethal ones, or one of the deadliest. Compare:


COVID-19 - infected 24,478; deaths 492
Malaria - infected 228 million; deaths 405,000 (2018 data)
Tuberculosis - infected 25% of world population, i.e. ~2 billion; deaths 1.6 million (2017 data)
HIV/AIDS - infected 37.9 million; 1.7 million new cases a year; deaths 770,000 (2018 data)


Compared to malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, the COVID-19 outbreak is pretty much a rounding error.

In terms of lethality, COVID-19 has a case fatality rate of 1.4-6.5%. This is still well below the lethality of tuberculosis (43%) and HIV/AIDS (80-90% after 5 years if untreated), although it is more lethal than malaria (~0.3%)

It seems like, objectively, COVID-19 is a very small fish in the pond of infectious diseases. It's not like the three diseases above are unique either; there're lots more diseases that affect &amp; kill more people than nCoV (e.g. measles, leishmaniosis). Yet, right now, when people die of COVID-19 they make the news, while thousands of people die of the other three diseases every day without getting a mention. Further, COVID-19 is apparently attracting lots of research efforts to treat it. Why is it being prioritized over other infectious diseases?

I'm looking for objective answers as to why COVID-19 matters so much.
","The short answer to this question is that 2019-nCoV is new. All the other diseases you mentioned are known quantities: epidemiologists have a good idea how they behave, how they spread, what is likely to happen in a variety of different scenarios, etc. But this disease represents a new mutation that behaves differently from other coronaviruses. It's far more transmissible than other coronaviruses, and worse, seems to be transmissible through casual contact: not intimate contact, blood or fluid exposure, not through an intermediary vector like a tick or flea. Currently the death toll is low, but researchers simply do not have enough data to know whether that trend will continue. 

Remember, the death rate of influenza is lower than that of this coronavirus. The 1958 and 1967 influenza pandemics had death rates of about 0.1%, and the 1918 pandemic had a death rate of about 2.5%*. But those pandemics killed millions because they were so transmissible they infected hundreds of millions. If the coronavirus follows that pattern and turns pandemic, we might expect to see any city of a million or so people suffer 20,000 to 30,000 deaths over the course of a couple of months (say 400-500 per day), which is a huge number of people dying by any calculus. Discretion is definitely the better part of valor, here.

"President Trump speaking yesterday (Feb 26th 2020) gave an update about the response of the US to the novel coronavirus outbreak. In an announcement that introduced a new team to tackle the virus, Trump said that


  Because of all we've done (so far), the risk to the American people remains very low.


and that


  It is what it is. We're ready for it. We're really prepared. We have, as I said, we have the greatest people in the world. We're very ready for it. We hope it doesn't spread. There's a chance that it won't spread, too. And there's a chance that it will.


The president's remarks were then followed by Dr Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who reiterated the organisation's remarks of February 25th where the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, said that:


  Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country.


What measures, referred to by the President, have already been taken by the US government to prepare for the virus? Which of these have the Trump administration been responsible for? What is the purpose of the new team announced yesterday?
","Rather poorly one could say, with respect to testing. There's now outrage that the CDC has pursued its own flawed test kit under some version of NIH (which in this case stands for ""not invented here""), rather than adopt the one used by the WHO (and which was developed in Germany)...


  On Monday, following mounting criticism of the federal response, Trump administration officials promised a rapid expansion of the country’s testing capacities. With the help of private companies and academic centers, as many as a million diagnostic tests could be administered by the end of this week, said Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
  
  But many scientists wonder if the moves come too late. [...] Most disturbing of all: Did a failure to provide adequate testing give the coronavirus time to gain a toehold in the United States?
  
  “Clearly, there have been problems with rolling out the test,” said Dr. Thomas Frieden, former director of the C.D.C. “There are a lot of frustrated doctors and patients and health departments.”
  
  Still, Dr. Frieden said he thought the situation was improving. Other experts, although supportive of the agency, were mystified that federal officials could have committed so many missteps.
  
  “The incompetence has really exceeded what anyone would expect with the C.D.C.,” said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard University. “This is not a difficult problem to solve in the world of viruses.”
  
  Officials at the C.D.C. did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The agency abruptly canceled a news conference on Monday just as it was to begin. Officials appeared to have removed figures on the agency website counting how many Americans had been tested.
  
  In February, the C.D.C. rolled out a three-step diagnostic test and distributed testing kits — each of which could run about 800 tests — to state and local health laboratories. But some of the components of the diagnostic kits were flawed, and produced inconclusive results.
  
  A three-step replacement was promised but never arrived; the agency has not fully explained why, except to say that there was a manufacturing defect. As a result, diagnostic testing was only conducted at the agency’s labs in Atlanta.
  
  The C.D.C. eventually rolled out a two-step replacement and permitted a few laboratories, where the kits had been working, to continue using their tests. But those with only one working component of the test still could not diagnose patients on their own.
  
  Getting results from the C.D.C. took days, however, and in any event the criteria for testing were strict — among them, the patient must have had recent travel to China or contact with someone known to be infected.
  
  Doctors nationwide complained of a bottleneck, both because of the restrictive test criteria and because of the agency’s limited testing capacity. The agency said it had the capacity to test about 400 specimens a day.
  
  The test criteria were “too stringent, and people aren’t getting tested,” said Lauren M. Sauer, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine.
  
  [...]
  
  “We have been really frustrated, because one of the things that is a hallmark of public health labs is that we are usually ‘ready, set, go,’ and here we were — ‘ready, set, wait’,” said Scott Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories.
  
  Late last week, the Food and Drug Administration broke the logjam, authorizing state and local laboratories to do initial testing on their own. If labs had developed and validated a test, they could use it for diagnosis instead of relying on the C.D.C.’s version or waiting for a replacement.
  
  Other nations have tested patients by tens of thousands. China has probably tested millions.
  
  “How come the South Koreans can do 10,000 tests a day and we can’t?” said Ralph Baric, who studies coronaviruses and emerging diseases at University of North Carolina.
  
  Soon after the virus surfaced in China, the C.D.C. got to work on its own test. “Generally, C.D.C. provides these tests for the world,” said Dr. Frieden.
  
  But German researchers were devising their own test, which was quickly adopted by the World Health Organization for distribution around the world.
  
  After the C.D.C.’s version turned out to be flawed, the agency continued to pursue it, despite the fact that another diagnostic test was already in wide use.
  
  With F.D.A. approval, the agency could simply have distributed the test used by the W.H.O. instead of creating a new one from scratch, Dr. Mina said. The government could do so even now.
  
  “It’s just a very American approach to say, ‘We’re the U.S., the major U.S. public health lab, and we’re going to not follow the leader,’” Dr. Mina said.

"
"If, as a US citizen or resident, I had flu-like symptoms and if I was not covered by Medicaid/Medicare and didn't have health insurance, who would be liable for paying for COVID-19 test diagnostics in a US hospital?

I saw an offhand remark about ""the cost and people not getting tested as a result"", in an online forum.  It wasn't even a claim that it was happening, more like a quip that it might happen.

The US healthcare vs Euro/Canadian-style coverage debate has been done to death, but it usually revolves around the problems lack of coverage brings to the people who are ill.  This is not what I am asking about.

An epidemic situation however brings a different dynamic:  there's a vested interested for everyone else that sick people are identified as such and isolated, it's not just about the being well-being of the patients.  To assist in containment, you want to remove as many barriers to early diagnosis as possible.

Is there/could there be some form of emergency funding for at least the tests themselves, at the federal level?  One model is for example, the financial arrangements around vaccination programs.

Edit:

the question concerns the procedure for the entire test, i.e. lab services as well as clinic time:  seeing a doctor/nurse, taking the tests and getting the results.  Nothing more, but also all of what's necessary for a YES/NO answer wrt having COVID-19 or not.  

Bryan's answer is great wrt to the kit and lab services themselves, but someone still needs to interview you and take whatever samples are necessary to send off for testing,

Do these arrangements vary by state?  Or does the Federal govt, through the CDC, have jurisdiction?

State vs Federal:  it seems to me that a Federal-level guidance ought to be faster than waiting for all 50 states to come up with their own programs individually.
","The CDC covers the cost of testing itself, however, this may not be the only type of cost incurred.



A recent New York Times article presents a case study of exactly the sort of scenario described in the question.

Americans who were living in China and evacuated from Wuhan did not have health insurance in the US and were given a $3,918 bill for care during quarantine, including $2,598 for ambulance transportation. Neither ultimately tested positive.


  He did receive a document upon leaving quarantine directing him to contact a government email address with any medical bills. He sent an email on Feb. 24 detailing the charges and asking what would be done.
  
  “My question is why are we being charged for these stays, if they were mandatory and we had no choice in the matter?” Mr. Wucinski wrote in his message.
  
  He has not received a response, he said.


Since then, after being contacted by the Times, the hospital stated the bill was in error:


  When contacted by The New York Times, a Rady Children’s Hospital spokesman said the physicians’ bill had been sent in error and that the family would not be held responsible for the charges.


..but it is not clear whether this is a matter of policy or a public relations move by the hospital, nor is it clear how these matters will be handled going forward. It also does not yet resolve the $2600 ambulance bill (of course this is all still pending).

The government can order mandatory quarantines, but as far as who pays:


  “There is no uniform practice,” said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. “They do have the powers, but they’ve almost never used them in modern times.”


Without some new government intervention, it seems that for now costs will either be charged to patients or simply absorbed by the treating facilities (by not billing).



The American Hospital Association and American Nurses Association on Feb 27, 2020 have asked for the government to fund care related to the epidemic. It seems likely that there will be further political fights over what exactly is done next.



update: As of March 4th, 2020, an agreement was reached in the House on a bill for COVID-2019 funding, which is expected to pass there and later in the Senate. This bill does not address how to deal with care and testing for the uninsured, though it includes state and local funding. It's unclear at this time how those funds could/will be used:


  Congress didn't explicitly address how to handle funding for mandatory quarantines or the uninsured. The package would send $950 million in state and local grants, with half of the money due within 30 days. States will receive a minimum of $4 million.

"Various governments seem to be playing whack-a-mole with travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines in the recent COVID-19 epidemic. First Chinese residents were banned from numerous countries. Afterwards travel bans expanded to South Korea, Japan, Iran and most recently Italy. Yet despite all the travel restrictions, the virus managed to successfully spread out all across the globe. 

So why continue with the practice of restricting foreign travel, especially when the virus has already been identified to be spreading at the local level? E.g. why doesn't the US remove travel restrictions on Chinese visitors, given that the virus has already been detected in numerous states?

Update: There are now 10 thousand official cases in the US, but travel restrictions are still in place for some reason.
","While it has clearly been shown by the virility of the virus so far that travel restrictions will not stop the inevitable community spread of the illness, and that their effectiveness as impeding the spread of the virus is small, the aim of the policy is no longer to stop the virus, but to delay it. This was confirmed as current policy in the UK's response to the virus by the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, on March 5th.

There are a few reasons why this is the goal of many governments. Firstly, if the peak of the pandemic can be delayed, this allows plans to be put in place for management of the crisis. For example, in the UK, plans have been floated that would allow final year medical students and trainee doctors to take on hospital duties during the nine week period that the virus is currently predicted to have the highest effect on the NHS, in order to mitigate the strain on the service.

Secondly, delaying the spread of the virus allows time for a vaccine to be developed. While research on this is progressing quickly, it will still take time for the vaccine to pass clinical trials and be approved for human usage. In addition, as @Patricia Shanahan points out in the comments, the effectiveness of existing drugs already approved for treating similar respiratory diseases can be evaluated, which could be ready sooner than developing brand new drugs or a vaccine.

Finally, as health services are acknowledged as being under the most strain during the winter months, the best time for the pandemic to peak would be in the middle of summer.

To this end, the policy of travel bans, while having been shown to be relatively ineffective at preventing the spread of the disease outright, is being used to delay the spread of the virus as much as possible, to allow national governments to prepare for the full impact of the peak of the predicted pandemic.
"
"So a series of news articles are being spread around that purportedly attributes some of Bernie Sanders' losses in states due to low voter turnout.   A quick search on Google reports tens of articles all claiming the same or similar findings:


Google search


However, I recently saw an article on Reddit that says this claim is being falsified by purposely misattributing one statistic as another, but I don't know how verifiable the information is considering it's not a news source I'm familiar with.


Bernie Sanders and the Myth of Low Youth Turnout in the Democratic Primary


If anything, I am more wary of the quantity of news reports. Earlier this month, Snopes.com published a fact-checking article disproving a wide swathe of news reports that Corona beer sales dropped due to fear about the coronavirus, and this is something I am not sure is also going on with the Sanders/youth voter turnout issue.

In any case, did low youth turnout affect Bernie Sanders' results in the Super Tuesday primaries?  Or, as the 2nd linked article claims, is it not true?
","There's a lot of spin going on in all camps, including the Sanders camp. This is par for the course in a political election year.

The article you cited is guilty of the same criticisms it makes of other articles. It fails to provide any concise information about how many voters in the 18-29 age range in 2020 turned out compared to 2016.

In fairness, this is partly because election officials do not track voters by age when they vote. So the only way to know anything about this kind of metric is to look at the same exit polls the article rejects as inaccurate.

The Sanders campaign, like other campaigns, do their own polling and sampling. So they have pretty much the best idea of anyone as to how well they've really done. So listen to what Bernie himself said:

""Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing in young people in? And the answer is 'no',"" he told reporters at a press briefing on Wednesday.

""We're making some progress but historically everybody knows that young people do not vote in the kind of numbers that older people vote,"" Sanders went on. ""I think that will change in the general election. But to be honest with you, we have not done as well in bringing young people into the process. It is not easy.""

Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-admits-hes-not-inspiring-enough-young-voters-2020-3

However, that's not the only thing we can infer from available data. If you put together a spreadsheet state-by-state to tally vote totals compared to votes received by Sanders, you will see a strong pattern. The data shows that Sanders' overall vote count is running 20-30% LOWER than in 2016 in most states that have voted so far, despite the fact that across-the-board vote count is running 10-30% HIGHER than in 2016. Sanders defenders argue that this is because the field was so much bigger and stronger than in 2016, but I see this as a throwaway argument. If Sanders was really a strong vote-getter, he wouldn't be bleeding support compared to 2016 because the ones who voted for him then already knew him, whereas his opponents this year were mostly newcomers to the primaries. He already had name recognition that the others didn't have among Democratic voters.

So what does this broader insight tell us? Well, all of the polls we've seen say that Sanders' support levels are strongest among the 18-29 age range. So if he's hemorrhaging that much voter support in the overall numbers, it either means that the number of voters in the 18-29 range matched 2016 while the rest of his supporters disappeared almost completely into the woodwork, or (much more likely) his support among 18-29 year olds sagged compared to four years ago along with the other age groups.

Given Sanders' remarks Business Insider quoted, I'd go with the latter likelihood.
"
"On Friday, Russia declined to participate in a plan devised by the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut oil production levels, in order to keep oil prices steady in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The article describes this refusal as the cause of the 10% oil price crash on Friday alone, which was exacerbated by a further 30% crash on Monday.

What reasons has Russia given for their refusal to participate in the OPEC group's plan?
","Disclaimer: I'm no expert, this answer is based on my modest understanding of the situation at play.

The OPEC decision to cut oil production was meant to keep prices high: if every OPEC country were selling all the oil they could, it would drive prices down since there would be more supply than demand. So if every OPEC country agrees to sell only a limited amount of oil, the global supply matches the global demand and prices stay high. Naturally this works only if all the big oil producing countries play the game: it's tempting for a country to sell more than its agreed quota, especially if the price is high.

Russia is not an official member of OPEC, only an observer. As such, it is free to follow OPEC policies or not, depending on its own interests and strategy. I'm not aware of any official reason why Russia refused to follow this particular recent decision, but it looks like a rational economic decision: if many oil producers (competitors) reduce their supply and the prices are high, why would Russia limit their own supply if they have no obligation to?  

""This refusal is cited as the cause of the 10% oil price crash on Friday alone, which was exacerbated by a further 30% crash on Monday.""

This is not the full explanation: the Russian refusal led Saudi Arabia to cancel the original plan to reduce production (Guardian), and instead to flood the market with their own oil. This is what drove prices down sharply, especially in the current context of low demand due to the corona virus.

The Saudi surprise strategy could arguably be interpreted as a kind of tactical response against Russia's refusal to play according to OPEC rules: since Russia apparently wants to reap the benefits of high prices without sacrificing their own production, Saudi Arabia is telling them that ""two can play this game"". The effect is that all the oil producing countries are going to suffer from low prices, but some more than others:


  The new strategy adopted by Riyadh appears to target Russia and US shale oil firms, many of which are known to have high production costs and lose money when crude prices fall below $50 a barrel for more than a few months.


Saudi Arabia can produce oil at a lower cost than Russia and US shale oil industry, so they are probably trying to use the opportunity of the Russian refusal to get rid of some competitors: Saudi Arabia can afford to take a temporary economic hit, whereas many shale oil companies may go bankrupt quickly. Strategically, their initiative is certainly also meant to assert their dominance on the oil market.



[Added: a similar analysis by Kevin Drum, found just after posting my answer]


  The nickel version of this story is that oil prices started declining in February due to fears of lower demand caused by the coronavirus outbreak. OPEC tried to cut a deal with Russia to reduce output all around, but Russia balked. Saudi Arabia then decided to bring out its big guns, lowering prices immediately by about $7 per barrel and announcing that it would increase output in order to take share away from Russia. At that point the decline turned into a rout, with the price of WTI crude collapsing to $28 as I write this.

"
"According to Reuters news agency, the Director General of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference today (March 11th) that:


  We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and
  severity and by the alarming levels of inaction. We have therefore
  made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic,


The same article, however, cites unnamed WHO officials as saying that the term ""pandemic"" is just a descriptive word and does not carry any legal significance.

What significance, if any, does the characterisation that has been made today have?
","Very little, practically speaking.

From the WHO:


  ""Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO’s assessment of the threat posed by this #coronavirus. It doesn’t change what WHO is doing, and it doesn’t change what countries should do""-
  @DrTedros


As discussed in this Q&amp;A, the definition of ""pandemic"" is fairly arbitrary. It does identify this virus, both in the present day and in history, as particularly significant, but there is nothing magical that changes with this definition from a political (or epidemiological) perspective, and there appear to be no particular political consequences of the definition from the WHO's perspective.

That is, there are no special funds or protocols that are activated by declaring a ""pandemic"" the way you might expect for various ""declarations of emergency"", which often activate laws that change regulations and procedures during the emergency and may allow for release of funds marked for that purpose.

From the content of the announcement, it seems like the WHO's primary goal in making this declaration is to reiterate the severity of the situation rather than to mark any particular milestone or to alter any guidance or recommendations.

Contain - identify cases as soon as possible, and attempt to prevent wider community spread of the virus. Powers have been given to enforce quarantines and extra funding granted to healthcare centres. The goal is to stop the virus from taking hold in the country.
Delay - if containment does not work, measures such as closing schools, banning large gatherings, and incentivising working from home will be introduced. The goal is to delay the inevitable spread of the virus for as long as possible.
Research - if measures taken to delay the virus prove ineffective, focus efforts on researching how to best fight the virus; working out how it spreads, and the best treatment methods. This includes research into vaccine development and deployment.
Mitigate - the last resort scenario, at this point the government will focus on keeping essential services such as police/fire/ambulance functional, as well as bringing retired and newly graduated doctors to the frontlines.


At the moment, the UK Government insists that the country is still in the containment phase, despite the country's Chief Medical Officer and the government's chief medical advisor, Prof. Chris Whitty telling MPs as early as March 5th that the UK ""was now ""mainly"" in the delay phase"".

At first glance the government's refusal to move to the delay phase, despite 460 total cases, and confirmed community spread, seems stubborn and almost deluded, however, the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport, Jeane Freeman told MSPs after attending a COBRA meeting on the 10th that 


  The timing of moving into the ‘delay’ phase, and what measures are
  judged to be the most effective in that phase, must be and are driven
  very firmly by scientific and clinical advice. Understandably people
  will be looking to the situation in other countries and questioning
  why some of the moves they are taking are not being made here yet in
  Scotland and in the UK.
  
  [...]
  
  Timing is critical. If we take those measures too soon, we will not
  have the impact we need. If we take them too late, we will not reduce
  demand [on the NHS] to the level we need


What is the risk behind taking these measures - i.e. moving into the delay phase - too soon? I note that Poland, for example, which has a fraction of the cases of the UK, will close all museums, cinemas, &amp; schools from Monday. Why might this be a mistake? Is there any research that has evaluated this?

(Note that although the example I have given is UK-based, I am also interested in answers that refer to the general postponement of more extreme countermeasures internationally)
","Specifically with reference to the UK, an article in the Guardian reports that 


  Experts have warned about the risk that if tough measures are taken too soon, “fatigue” may set in, prompting the public to disregard the advice just as the virus reaches its peak.


Effectively the argument is that, absent some sort of enforcement squad if people are told to stay in lockdown for a significant period, without a significant scare factor to justify it, then people will assume the risk is actually overblown and start mingling again, just at the moment that many of them are at their most contagious, starting a whole new outbreak in the herd of uninfected.

"Breaking news


  US President Donald Trump has announced sweeping new travel restrictions on Europe in a bid to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
  
  In a televised address, he said travel from 26 European countries would be suspended for the next 30 days.
  
  But he said the ""strong but necessary"" restrictions would not apply to the UK, where 460 cases of the virus have now been confirmed.
  
  [...]
  
  Mr Trump said the European Union had ""failed to take the same precautions"" as the US in fighting the virus.
  
  A Presidential Proclamation, published shortly after Mr Trump's address, specified that the ban applies to anyone who has been in the EU's Schengen border-free area within 14 days prior to their arrival in the US.


N.B. additional reasons given in the US proclamation:


  The administration’s European travel proclamation notes that “the Schengen Area has exported 201 COVID-19 cases to 53 countries. Moreover, the free flow of people between the Schengen Area countries makes the task of managing the spread of the virus difficult.”


What has the (official) reaction from the EU been regarding this US action?
","There have been a number of reactions from the EU so far - some official, others not so much. I've decided, in the world of Twitter diplomacy, to count tweets from ministers and current/former heads of government as official responses for this purpose. Responses are in chronological order, culminating with the joint statement by President von der Leyen and President Michel.

The first response from a current or former head of government came from former Finnish Prime &amp; Foreign minister, Alexander Stubb who tweeted at 5:18 UTC:


  Any attempt to contain the #CoronaOutbreak is welcome, but the
  decision of  @realDonaldTrump  to exclude the UK from a European
  travel ban is nothing short of irresponsible. Viruses do not recognise
  borders. Decisions should be based on facts, not politics.


The European Council President, Charles Michel, then tweeted his initial response at 6:12 UTC, saying that


  Following the travel ban  @realDonaldTrump  announced, we will assess
  the situation today. 
  
  Economic disruption must be avoided. 
  
  #Europe is taking all necessary measures to contain the spread of the #COVID19 virus, limit the number of affected people and support research.


Former Prime Minister of Romania &amp; current leader of the Renew party in the European Parliament, Dacian Cioloş, tweeted that


  Viruses know no borders or nationalities. Nationalism &amp; blame games
  are no antidote. This is a global crisis, which requires global
  solidarity,  @realDonaldTrump . Containment measures are needed, but
  not arbitrary ones. Europe will be your partner, but not your
  scapegoat. #COVID19


Speaking to BBC Breakfast, British Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that the UK had no plan to emulate the US travel ban. (I am aware the UK is no longer an EU member, but I feel this response is still relevant.)


  We haven't believed that that's the right thing to do, the evidence
  here doesn't support that.
  
  What we are trying to do is contain the virus while recognising that
  it is now likely that it will spread more significantly.


Guy Verhofstadt, former Prime Minister of Belgium, tweeted at 9:51 UTC that:


  Nationalism isn't the answer to #COVID19, because viruses don't care
  about borders or nationalities. We are all in this together. We need a
  European approach to save lives &amp; bold interventions to protect our
  economy.


At 10:40 UTC, an official joint statement was released by President Ursula von der Leyen and President Charles Michel:


  The Coronavirus is a global crisis, not limited to any continent and
  it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action.
  
  The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to
  improve a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation.
  
  The European Union is taking strong action to limit the spread of the
  virus.

"
"Wikipedia lets us know that:


  A Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) is a formal declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) of ""an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response"", formulated when a situation arises that is ""serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected"", which ""carries implications for public health beyond the affected state's national border"" and ""may require immediate international action"". Under the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR), states have a legal duty to respond promptly to a PHEIC.
  
  [...]
  
  On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19, centered on Wuhan in central China, a PHEIC. [...]


It's unclear to me from that if a WHO PHEIC declaration (and thus the obligations following from that) are limited to an area or country that the WHO decides ""to PHEIC"" or is a PHEIC declaration on some concern, e.g. this-or-that-disease ""is PHEIC'd"" automatically entails that all IHR member countries have to respond similarly, e.g. report [all] cases of that disease. So what's the (geographical) scope of a PHEIC? Does the WHO have the latitude to ""customize it""?
","A PHEIC declaration does not apply to a specific area - it is just that, a declaration by the WHO that the Directory-General has determined that a public health emergency of international concern exists pursuant to Article 12 of the International Health Regulation (2005). Paragraph 5 of Article 12 states that


  If the Director-General, following consultations with the State Party
  within whose territory the public health emergency of international
  concern has occurred, considers that a public health emergency of
  international concern has ended, the Director-General shall take a
  decision in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 49.


Paragraph 6 of Article 49 states that 


  The Director-General shall communicate to States Parties the
  determination and the termination of a public health emergency of
  international concern, any health measure taken by the State Party
  concerned, any temporary recommendation, and the modification,
  extension and termination of such recommendations, together with the
  views of the Emergency Committee.


Here, States Parties refers to all state parties to the IHR - so any declaration of a PHEIC is therefore applicable globally, and obligates state parties to notify the WHO of any local spread of the disease. Notably, the declaration of a disease to be a PHEIC does not actually introduce new obligations to state parties directly, but as states are required under Article 6 to


  notify WHO, by the most efficient means of communication available, by
  way of the National IHR Focal Point, and within 24 hours of assessment
  of public health information, of all events which may constitute a
  public health emergency of international concern within its territory
  in accordance with the decision instrument, as well as any health
  measure implemented in response to those events


the designation of the disease to be a PHEIC means that the event is notifiable, and as a result, the declaration of a PHEIC affects all state parties by definition.

However, if we refer back to Article 49, note that the Director-General is obligated to communicate temporary recommendations with regard to public health. These temporary recommendations are non-binding and time-limited, and are described further in Article 15, paragraph 2 of which states that


  Temporary recommendations may include health measures to be
  implemented by the State Party experiencing the public health
  emergency of international concern, or by other States Parties,
  regarding persons, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods
  and/or postal parcels to prevent or reduce the international spread of
  disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic.


Therefore, these temporary recommendations need not be globally applicable, and can apply to just one, or a few state parties.

In conclusion then, while the declaration of a PHEIC is applicable globally, the temporary recommendations issued as a result of the declaration are not required to be, and in general, aren't.

"The US government suspended travel from Europe to US, except for countries which are not in the Schengen area such as the UK and Ireland.

Many comments from EU leader seem to assume that this is a political decision rather than a health-based decision, especially with regard to this exception.

Is there any official rationale for this exception?
","The official rationale, according to Trump's presidential proclamation, is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could become overwhelmed ""if sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus occurred in the United States on a large scale"". It continues:


  The World Health Organization has determined that multiple countries
  within the Schengen Area are experiencing sustained person-to-person
  transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
  
  [...]
  
  The Schengen Area currently has the largest number of confirmed
  COVID-19 cases outside of the People’s Republic of China.  As of March
  11, 2020, the number of cases in the 26 Schengen Area countries is
  17,442, with 711 deaths, and shows high continuous growth in infection
  rates.  In total, as of March 9, 2020, the Schengen Area has exported
  201 COVID-19 cases to 53 countries.  Moreover, the free flow of people
  between the Schengen Area countries makes the task of managing the
  spread of the virus difficult.
  
  The United States Government is unable to effectively evaluate and
  monitor all of the travelers continuing to arrive from the Schengen
  Area.  The potential for undetected transmission of the virus by
  infected individuals seeking to enter the United States from the
  Schengen Area threatens the security of our transportation system and
  infrastructure and the national security.  Given the importance of
  protecting persons within the United States from the threat of this
  harmful communicable disease, I have determined that it is in the
  interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend
  the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of
  all aliens who were physically present within the Schengen Area during
  the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the
  United States.


The reasoning exposed in the proclamation, then, is that due to the lack of travel restrictions between Schengen countries, it is far harder to manage the spread of the disease by controlling inter-Schengen migration. This factor is attributed by the proclamation as the main cause of community spread throughout the 26 member countries, and even goes as far as to tacitly blame the international spread of the disease on the area.

At a practical level, consider someone arriving to the USA from Slovenia, a member of the Schengen area. While Slovenia itself only has 31 cases currently, it is impossible for USA immigration officials to tell whether that person has just driven from Italy, which has over 10,000 cases. As a result, the Trump administration seems to have decided that the best way to deal with this issue is a blanket ban (with some exceptions, e.g. US citizens, travellers invited by the US to aid efforts against Covid-19 etc. See proclamation for full details) on travel from the Schengen area countries and visitors who have visited the area within the last 14 days, the incubation period of the disease.

Travellers from a non-Schengen area, however, seem to be presumed to be able to prove that they haven't been in any Schengen countries in the last 14 days by their passport records, and as such the level of risk they pose should be able to  be more easily evaluated.

However, as pointed out in the comments, inter-European travel does not involve passport stamping in some cases, for example from Italy to the UK, so it will be difficult to identify these travellers practically. It is unclear how immigration officials will mitigate this.

The reasoning of the proclamation, however, remains that travel restrictions could be easily imposed between, to use our example, Italy and the UK, meaning that travellers from the UK are lower risk.

Update 14/03: The travel ban has now been extended to the UK and Ireland, which calls into question the original official rationale, but does not change it.
"
"President Trump's presidential proclamation specifically defines the countries affected by the ban as the 26 signatories to the Schengen Treaty:


  For purposes of this proclamation, the Schengen Area comprises 26
  European states: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,
  Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia,
  Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway,
  Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.


However, four European states also maintain open or semi-open borders with the Schengen area, namely Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, &amp; Vatican City. Clearly travellers from these countries will also be subject to the separate ban on people that have visited Schengen countries in the last 14 days, but considering the (semi)open borders, there should be no way to definitively prove this status one way or the other.

Are these countries exempt from the ban? Is this an oversight by the Trump administration, or do methods exist to identify travellers from these countries who have recently returned from the Schengen area proper?
","Given that none of these countries have their own international airports, and all but Monaco are landlocked, it's effectively impossible for nationals of those microstates to reach the US without visiting a Schengen country. 

Presumably, someone from Monaco who travels by boat to the UK and flies from there could get away with entry or any nationals who are currently outside the Schengen area, but I imagine the final decision will come down to an ICE official who will compare the passport to a list of affected countries.
"
"According to the Wall Street Journal, in order to attempt to slow the economic contraction caused by the Covid-19 virus, the Federal Reserve has promised to inject $1.5 trillion into the economy, by


  [making] vast sums of short-term loans available on Wall Street and
  [purchasing] Treasury securities in a coronavirus-related response aimed
  at preventing ominous trading conditions from creating a sharper
  economic contraction.


How can such a large sum of money be allocated to this without any debate or official order by the government? Where does this money come from? And how does providing loans to Wall Street help prevent the economy from contracting further?
","There's no loan here. What is happening is a buyback to inject money into the system (emphasis mine)


  Today the Fed announced a $1.5 trillion liquidity provision to the interbank lending market — primarily in the form of “repurchase agreements.” The interbank lending market comprises the federal-funds market (in which the Fed actively participates on a daily basis) and the repurchase-agreement (or “repo”) market (in which the Fed intervenes primarily when there is a lack of liquidity). In the repo market, one financial institution temporarily trades securities to another institution, with the understanding that it will repurchase those securities in the near future (usually the next day). Banks with large balance sheets often need access to quick cash to conduct regular operations, and the most practical way to get that cash is through repos. Otherwise, managing their balance sheets would be needlessly onerous. 


And


  [The Federal Reserve] is engaging in short-term transactions with banks to ensure financial stability. If the Fed bought your house today and sold it back to you tomorrow, it wouldn’t be doing you a huge favor. The Fed’s intervention in the repo market, while a boon to the U.S. financial system, is far from a handout.

"France held local elections even after coronavirus related restrictions had to be put in place. 

The article mentions only this rather general and vague reason for holding them:


  Macron decided to go ahead with the elections last week, saying it was
  vital the democratic system to continue functioning.


Clearly holding an elections means that lots of people are walking around and since the coronavirus spreads much easier that other viruses, it kind of defeats the purpose of existing restrictions.

Isn't it possible to delay elections in France?

Also, it is expected that voter turnout to be lower due to people being afraid of going out.

Question: Why did the French government organized elections as planned in spite of coronavirus restrictions?
","Scientists advising the government told them that, with appropriate measures (such as soap everywhere, >1m distance between everyone, etc.), it was no more dangerous than going to buy some food, which is still authorized. The full scientific advice has not been published yet (it should be though), but here is the head of the scientific committee confirming it :


  Le conseil scientifique a considéré qu’il n’y avait pas d’élément
  pour penser qu’il y aurait un surrisque pour ces personnes à condition
  que les élections soient organisées de façon pratique
  
  The scientific committee considered there was no element indicating
  more risk [to go vote than to go shopping] for those people [elderly
  people], if the elections are organized in a practical way.


There is also a question of politics and timing : on Thursday morning all parties asked that it be maintained (in particular the right-wing Senate president, who is now blamed for it), so they had to decide that. 
However, later the same day, the confinement measures were decided, which seemed to contradict the possibility to vote. But politically it was too late, cancelling the elections would go against advice given by all parties on Thursday morning. 
Since Macron was expected to lose the elections (which he mostly did), cancelling the election after every other party expressed against it would have been seen as an antidemocratic political maneuver.

Some of the opposition parties have since then declared that they only accepted to maintain the elections before the confinement measures were decided, and thus that they could not decide in all knowledge, and would have changed their minds after the confinement measures were announced.
"
"In the last couple of days, WHO officials have criticised the UK government's approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, describing the government's reliance on developing herd-immunity amongst the British population, and apparent reluctance to put in place quarantines as ""ridiculous"".

China has also been criticised for its initial response to the virus, which the Financial Times describes as a ""cover-up"", and which US national security advisor Robert O'Brien says ""cost the world community two months"" in terms of preparation for the disease. This would appear to be in breach of the International Health Regulations (2005), Article 6 of which states that:


  Each State Party shall notify WHO, by the most efficient means of
  communication available, by way of the National IHR Focal Point, and
  within 24 hours of assessment of public health information, of all
  events which may constitute a public health emergency of international
  concern within its territory


Given the criticisms above, does the World Health Organization have any powers to either enforce health recommendations such as quarantines or lockdowns, powers to punish or sanction countries that refuse to comply with said health recommendations, or powers to punish countries that breach their obligations under the IHR?

I have been able to find this article which describes a panel which investigated this in the wake of the ebola crisis, but I can't find more information about the results of this investigation.
","
  WHO officials have criticised the UK government's approach to the COVID-19 pandemic


Actually the quoted criticism does not come from the WHO, nor from a current employee of the WHO. It comes from 


  Professor Anthony Costello, ex-director of maternal and child health at the World Health Organisation


The criticism is of the claim that the UK government should


  ""just let 60% of the population get it""


These appear to be the words of a radio presenter not a published policy of the UK government.

The UK's Health Secretary recently said Herd immunity is not the policy of the UK government.


  “Herd immunity is not our policy. It’s not our goal. Our goal is to protect life and our policy is to fight the virus and protect the vulnerable and protect the NHS. And that’s what we’re doing. Now there is a, of course there’s a scientific debate around scientific concepts, but I want to be absolutely crystal clear that we will do what is necessary to protect life,”


So the premise is questionable.



The subject of herd immunity and the 60% figure came from an interview with the chief scientific adviser to the UK government. He was apparently speaking about the conditions for a potential resurgence of COVID-19 next winter and beyond. 




  Does the World Health Organization have the power to impose sanctions?


Not really, not of the sort the question seems to suggest.

The WHO did impose sanctions on a news-media organisation that leaked information in advance of a publication date. WHO banned the organisation from its press conferences for two weeks.

Any UN member state can apply for membership of the WHO. It seems likely the WHO can, as a sanction, expel a member from the WHO. I suspect only the UN itself could expel a state from the UN.

In the past, the WHO has been associated with criticisms of punitive sanctions on countries as hampering the objectives of the WHO. The WHO seems to generally aim to assist rather than punish countries.

Like any individual or organization, the WHO can advocate for or against a sanction. As a UN specialized agency it is likely to be listened to by the UN assemblies. As I understand it, it does not have the power itself to commit the UN to sanctions.

It is normally UN member states who would apply and enforce punitive sanctions following a resolution of the UN security council of which the UK is a permanent member with veto rights.
"
"So far it appears that Western countries especially in Europe (e.g. Italy, Spain, UK, France, Germany) struggle to curb the spread of COVID-19. This is in contrast to most Asian countries (China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore) which were hit by the virus earlier, but managed to reduce the contagion through drastic containment measures.

While it's probably too soon to evaluate the effect of the strong measures which have been implemented in the past few days in many European countries, it looks as if Western countries have been reluctant and/or unable and/or inefficient at implementing the methods used in Asia to fight the contagion. It also looks as if Asian countries are expected to be more disciplined and/or organized than Western countries (example).

Are there any objective reasons why Western countries are less efficient than Asian countries in the fight against COVID-19?

Added: For example, are there different political choices which were made before and during the outbreak? Are there structural differences, for instance in the way governments can deploy resources in a crisis? 
","Part of it is going to be that the region (HK, Singapore, SK?, China) was hit much harder during the 2003 SARS epidemic so spent more time getting prepared.

Also, it has long been the expectation that the next epidemic would come out of China, both due to population density and proximity to livestock/wild animals, so those countries could expect another ""gift"" from their Chinese neighbors.

Japan?  It's relatively unscathed so far, but it is an isolated island, with comparatively few foreigners which isn't on great terms with its Asian neighbors.  As @bobsburner mentioned, ""travel density"" counts for a great deal with covid-19.  For now - counting it as luck, might become skill later.  Or its success might just be down to not-testing, as @steros says.

Supply chains are in Asia.  This is being shown as an Achilles' heel of Western service-oriented economies:  if we need to ramp production of electronic testing kits or ventilators, we are cut off from a lot of the world's manufacturing capacity.

Collectivism vs. individualism has a part to play in it as well:  it's more difficult for a Western politician to push drastic measures like quarantine (let alone China's dictatorial system).  Still, Italy was pretty quick to do so, because they had no choice.  Still, the cultural traits leading to quick acceptance by the community of harsh limitations on individual liberties seems to be an Asian advantage at this point:

Here's a Medical Sciences Stack Exchange answer re. isolation, testing and surveillance procedures followed in Guangdong, near HK, so not Wuhan at all.  An article partly covering Wuhan itself.  And we've heard of the one-week hospitals.  We're just not there yet, in terms of mobilization. Or coercion.

Constant deficit spending.  A country like Italy is at 130%+ GDP debt.  They've resisted pressure to shape up their finances, tax collection, pension payments, etc... for decades.  They just don't have anything left to surge spending in emergencies.  This applies to just too many European economies.

It's also really too early to say much about the final outcome.  Currently South Korea and China are better at getting the disease under control, but what really counts is the long run.  If a few dozen people in Wuhan spread the disease rapidly in January then we need to be ready to wait this out for a while - ""social distancing &amp; quarantines"" for 3 months, then relaxing will result in restarted epidemics.

There's also, esp. at the start, plain luck.  The 2003 SARS epidemic hit Canada's west coast less than Toronto, because a doctor got bad vibes about a patient with breathing problems and she isolated them, before any outbreak was known.  In Toronto the same type of cases mingled with the general hospital staff and patients and the outbreak was much worse.  In Italy 1 covid case was not identified as such and went to the hospital 4 times, interacting with everyone else.  S. Korea had a massive cluster early on, but it was within a religious sect, which might interact less with others.

It's hard to really assign a ""good vs bad"" label to early spread.  Past that, the quality of political leaders and their ability to balance out economic/social reality vs medical advice (which is still operating in uncertainty - witness the UK's ""herd"" approach) is going to be key.  This is a good time to be listening to experts, and there some of the Asian technocrats are a definite better bet than some of the West's populists.  I know I wouldn't be thrilled to have Duterte in the Philippines in charge, for example, and he's Asian.

Rather than competition and comparisons, it might be useful to see what has been achieved so far:  to some extent S. Korea and China have shown that aggressive testing and quarantines can slow the disease, Australia was very quick to sequence the bug's genome, we got a test within weeks! and some Western countries are starting to look at and evaluate candidate vaccines.  We are much better off in 2020 than if SARS had had that kind of punch in 2003.
"
"Central Banks around the world have cut interest rates in the past few days in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the US Federal Reserve (0-0.25%), the Bank of England (0.1%), and the Reserve Bank of Australia (0.25%). Notably, the European Central Bank has not yet cut interest rates further, but this is partly because it is already in the negatives, at -0.5%.

Why are central banks taking this measure in response to this pandemic in particular - i.e. how does this measure lessen the pandemic's economic impact - and what are the impacts on the average consumer of a cut in their country's central bank interest rate in general?
","By lowering interest rates the Fed's main goal is to prop up the stock market, and support US corporations.

This is achieved through the following effects:
- it encourages credit creation through bank lending, and because most money originates in credit it makes money cheaper and more widely available
- it lowers the rates of return on savings and thus encourages savers to spend more freely, which has a twofold effect: it stimulates the economy into the creation of yet more loans, and it tells savers to go elsewhere with their money

The resulting availability of money/credit and lowered bank savings rates makes the stock market an attractive destination.

Since 2007, the financial crisis, the Fed is essentially a hostage of the stock market in that if now must keep loose monetary policy to further the illusion of perpetual long term stock market gains. This is further evidenced by the tentative and then aborted QT (quantitive tightening) attempt last year. 

In the current climate of coronavirus economic meltdown, the lowered interest rate has a further goal: to help protect US corporations who are now overstretched on corporate bonds.

Since 2007, unbeknownst to many, and I think illegal outside the US (?) , corporations  - rather than restructure in the wake of the crisis - regularly take advantage of the cheap money stimulus by issuing corporate bonds (essentially borrowing money at low rates) so that their execs can use this to direct the company to purchase its own stock on the stock market. This creates the illusion of rising corporate value while allowing shareholders to receive big dividends and CEOs to pay themselves income related bonuses.

This irresponsible corporate behaviour has brought US corporations to the point that the coronavirus meltdown has slowed earnings below what they need to pay on the corporate bonds. Without direct government support many US corporations will go bust, and corporate bond prices will plummet, which will trigger further meltdown in financial institutions that invest in those assets.

Again, silently under the media radar, just this week the US (?) and ECB created new funds that will be directed to supply money to those institutions buying corporate bonds. To be clear, the way that works is that bondholders who are now nervous about the corporation defaulting might not roll over their bond....rather than reacquiring bonds at the end of their term, or even ending prematurely, they will demand their money from the corps. The corps. don't have it, but new bonds will be sold to the govt backed funds. (Once again the taxpayer bails out the fatcat)

So in summary, the reduced interest rate in combo with new funds, is designed to prop up the stock market and corporations to prevent socioeconomic collapse.

Around the world, central banks lower the rate for the effects of stimulus and stock market prop-up described above. ECB does not lower because the negative interest rate actually makes loans more expensive in some cases as being paid to borrow makes it easier than to lend.

"Japan is currently the nation with the highest debt as a percentage of GDP - at the time of writing it stands at over 250%. Greece, currently the second most indebted nation, went through a decade-long debt crisis after the 2008 financial crash. It entered this crisis with debt levels of 'only' 103% of GDP, and over the entire debt crisis, this only increased to 181% of GDP.

How is Japan able to withstand this level of debt without entering a debt crisis similar to Greece? Is this the right metric to look at, or are there other factors specific to either country?
","Their economies are radically different otherwise.


Greece has a weak economy in most fields, with the exception of tourism.  Japan is a manufacturing and scientific powerhouse.
Greece runs recurring high deficits and had rarely, if ever, shown inclination to stop doing so.  While Japan was criticized at the start of their financial decline for insisting on balanced budgets instead of stimulating demand.
Tax collection.  Japan does it.  Greece didn't.
Japan could devaluate its currency if necessary to adjust its finances.  Greece couldn't, being on the euro.
Japanese government debt is, I believe, mostly owed to Japanese investors and denominated in yen, unlike Greece's.
Japan has demonstrated for decades that it can pay its bills, on its own.  Greece on the other hand just seemed as if the only thing that kept it up was euro membership.
Greek official statistics were not, and had not for a while, been trusted.  They're still prosecuting the guy who showed they were cooking the books.


Until 2008, Greece was only getting charged a 0.25% point premium over German bonds based on the tacit assumption that Europe (Euro-zone) would never let Greece go broke. Investors, out of greed and risk un-awareness (or trust in European taxpayers gullibility), parked their money in Greek bonds, rather than German ones, just to get that extra 0.25% point.

From https://www.bankofgreece.gr/Publications/Annrep1999.pdf (I find it hard to set hard time limits on Google to only look at stuff from before a date):


  Specifically, the yield differential between the Greek and the German 10-year
  bond fell from roughly 270 basis points at end-1998 to about 200 basis points in March
  1999 (see Chart VI.1).


At the start of the general crisis, investors started wondering if trusting that Europe would always back Greek debt, even when undergoing a Europe-wide crisis, was a wise idea.  Once perception soured, the game was up very quickly.  Financing costs for Greek government debt went up, fast.  Any refinancing happened at progressively higher rates.  A debt that looked bad at the previous, lower, rate seemed like it would result in a short term default.  People still loaned to Greece, but the premium to do so was massive and made this very quickly unsustainable.

The plug was pulled, late high-rate private and non-European investors got a haircut.  Europe's taxpayers paid up enough money for Greece to keep paying slightly lowered interests, at deferred times, to the big German and French banks so they wouldn't take too massive a loss (and so that loss of confidence wouldn't spread, as per @Machavity answer).

Most Greek debt remained in place, unlike what happens in say an Argentinian default.  In fact, money ""helpfully"" loaned to keep Greece from defaulting on interest payments just got added to the overall debt.  In a way, though it fully deserved the initial mess it got, that's the tragedy of Greece.  Instead of the reset that comes with a default, Greeks got this unending misery of servicing a debt which is only pretended to be fully recoverable from (as most of my post is critical, I want to stress that, IMHO, the Greek people don't deserve to live through this for decades).

But no one is too willing to put their hands in that wolf's jaws anymore.

As o.m. says, mostly perception. Until COVID-19 at least, Japan looks like it has a few good years left for investors, most of whom are Japanese and have little interest in rocking the boat.  This is not to say it is financially healthy, only that it is under less external pressure.

Greece relies on foreign money, didn't look good in 2008 and doesn't now.  In most other conditions, big chunks of that 181% would have been written off as unrecoverable already.

"In the middle of the Covid-19 lockdown, at least in France and in Italy newsagents are in the list of first-necessity stores that remain open. ""To go buy a newspaper"" is a legitimate reason to leave one's house.

I wonder about the motivations of this decision: buying a newspaper is not essential by any definition of the term. Television, radio and internet are largely sufficient to cover the need for information of the general population.

Is there a reasonable political explanation for this? At first sight, it seems that the only one is the ties and the balance of power between politicians and news outlets / medias.
","At least in Italy, this appears to be in part a response to pressure from newspapers and their readers. On March 11th, the director of la Repubblica newspaper Carlo Verdelli published (in Italian) an article asking for newsagents to be included in the list of essential services, saying that ""The list is missing a service that is more fundamental 
 now than ever before, that of information"". He went on to state that ""If [newsagents] were not included in the list, it would cause irreparable damage, not only for newspapers, but most importantly for the citizenry."" (my translation)

This is an important point, as a study undertaken by the Pew Research Center in 2017 found that while TV and online media dominate, 31% of Italians and 23% of French adults get their news from print media at least daily. This group is likely to be composed of older citizens who will be most affected if they contract the virus, and although this puts them at more risk if they leave their houses to buy a newspaper, it is of higher importance to keep at-risk groups informed. 

In addition, another Pew Research Center study found that newspapers were especially important for coverage of local news that would not otherwise be reported in alternative media - although the study was limited to the US, this is another potential factor that could have influenced the decision.

It seems that France and Italy have decided that informing the populace is especially important in this time of crisis, and that this outweighs the threat public health and the potential spread of disease that the inclusion of newsagents as an essential service poses.
"
"To preface this, I'm not a supporter of Trump, but I disagree with the way some major media outlets have criticized him over his nickname for COVID-19, the ""Chinese virus"".   In addition, it is not only those outlets, but other governmental organizations like the WHO that have advised against dubbing COVID-19 in such a manner.

In the past we have had cases where a widespread global epidemic has also been referred to other countries or nationalities, such as:


The ""Spanish Flu"", although it should be known that the Spanish flu had origins little to do with Spain itself.
The ""Russian Flu"" or ""Asiatic Flu""
The Japanese Smallpox Epidemic
The Asian Flu and the Hong Kong Flu
The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which has been referred to as Saudi Arabia's SARS-like virus.


In any case, is the media backlash over Trump's nickname for COVID-19 justifiably warranted? Is there a problem in the way COVID-19 has been nicknamed?
","Let's appreciate the learning curve. The problem with all of those historical names is that they created sharp spikes in prejudice, social ostracism, and violence against the indicated groups, and still create issues today as seen here with COVID-19. It's true that the first identified cases of Covid-19 occurred in Wuhan China, but this does not imply that people of Chinese descent — or even people recently emigrated from China — are vectors for the disease, or in any way responsible for the problems that the disease causes. But in the minds of an unfortunate number of ignorant people, the mere association of the disease with Chinese heritage can produce verbal and physical assaults, and/or other social pressures that can prevent Chinese people in any walk of life from getting access to necessities or essential services. 

Trump's very public insistence on calling this the 'Chinese virus', backed by his status as president, is guaranteed to significantly increase acts of discrimination and assault on people of Asian descent (whether or not they are specifically Chinese). It guarantees this merely by giving an authoritative affirmation to the most panicked, emotional, and ignorant portion of our society that those 'Chinese' are in some way responsible for the spread of Covid-19.

No doubt Trump does this intentionally. Trump thrives on the panicked, angry ignorance of others; that emotional state he knows how to manipulate to his own profit. And while he himself may not be concerned with the secondary impact of increased violence against people of Asian descent, people of Asian descent have a good deal to worry about.

A president ought to have the presence of mind not to inflame racial tensions in a situation where tensions are already running exceedingly high. Even if we wanted to argue that there is nothing terribly wrong with the phrasing in and of itself — that it's just a poor choice of words by a man whom no one considers to be eloquent, perhaps — misstatements by someone who is (ostensibly) the leader of the free world have significant consequences. If even one Asian American gets attacked because of someone emboldened by Trump's poor word choice, that is blood on Trump's hands.

"It's been recently reported that Trump's administration (Trump himself, but also Pompeo) has been referring to COVID-19 as ""China virus"" or ""Wuhan coronavirus"" etc., emphasizing the Chinese origin of the virus, despite the WHO's recommendations against using such geographical labelling.

The Trump administration says they are doing this (now) to combat (apparently recent) Chinese propaganda that the COVID-19 was introduced by the US Army to Wuhan during a (friendly) visit. (An accusation for which, I have to say, the Chinese political officials presented no real evidence, and which seems to contradict even what the Chinese scientists have been saying about the same issue.)

How did the US administration (top officials) usually refer to COVID-19 before the Chinese foreign ministry started to make such (unsupported) accusations (i.e. roughly before March 12)?
","Usually, the Trump administration referred to the virus as ""coronavirus"", ""the coronavirus"", or, more commonly in press releases and official documents, the official WHO name of  ""COVID-19"". The response team headed by VP Mike Pence was termed the ""Coronavirus Task Force"", for example.

There are however, instances prior to March 12th, when the allegations were tweeted by a Chinese official for the first time, where a location was attached to the disease. 

As far back as the start of February, White House chief economic advisor Larry Kudlow described the virus as ""the Chinese virus"" in an interview with Fox Business Network.

Mike Pompeo and Republican Senators &amp; Representatives repeatedly used the term ""Wuhan Virus"" in press briefings and in debates in the weeks leading up to the 12th. On the 9th, GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted a link to the CDC website, saying that it offered ""Everything you need to know about the Chinese coronavirus"".

On March 10th, Trump retweeted a tweet by Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, which calls the virus ""China Virus"" and says that ""the US stands a chance if we can control of our borders""(sic). In his address on March 11th which announced the travel ban to Schengen countries, Trump described the disease as a ""foreign virus"".

It should be noted that this is not specific to the Trump administration, indeed, before March, many media outlets also included a geographic adjective in their reporting, including the BBC, the Guardian, Al Jazeera, the Financial Times, Reuters, Scientific American, the Associated Press, the Global Times, and the Washington Post, amongst others. This term then fell out of use towards the end of February, as this analysis by Axios shows, being replaced by the WHO sanctioned terms. 

In conclusion, then, while US administration officials usually used the term ""coronavirus"", or the medical term ""COVID-19"", there was significant use of a geographic adjective, be that ""China"", ""Chinese"", or ""Wuhan"". While this was not initially exclusive to conservative politicians or administration officials, in the last couple of weeks in response to many claims that the term is racist, offensive, and inaccurate, this language has become far less popular, and now is used in the US almost solely by Republican officials &amp; conservative media outlets, and has become far more frequently used by these individuals.

"Can anyone explain to me how Italy was able to announce 651 COVID-19 deaths at 5:30 PM local time? How does the toll work? Isn't a ""daily death toll"" supposed to be from midnight to midnight?
Best Regards
","Official infection and death numbers tend to rely on reports accumulated through several layers of bureaucracy, often with daily reports at several levels. A hospital reports the numbers to the city administration, they are added up and sent to the province, and those are added up and sent to the national level. So the actual reporting period is not the day when the statistic was published, it is when the base data was collected. That tends to be in the fine print, what news and spokespeople care about is the relative change from the previous reporting period.

You can find the tracker from Johns Hopkins which tends to exceed official national figures because they take local statements and add them up in realtime, rather than waiting for the official reports to arrive. As of this writing, the CDC says there are 15k cases in the US whike Johns Hopkins says 35k cases; a closer look at the CDC site shows that they didn't update over the weekend ...

"In the US Senate on Sunday, March 22nd, Democrats blocked the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in a 47-47 vote that was split along party lines. McConnell indicated that he would try to pass the bill again on Monday, ostensibly so that Senators could see how markets would react to the lack of financial measures so far:


  We're going to vote at 9:45 in the morning (1345 GMT) ... 15 minutes
  after the markets open and see whether there's a change of heart,


This timing was not agreed to, with the debate continuing later in the day than planned, seemingly with no further bilateral progress made.

The first article also notes that Democrats ""decried the Republican proposal as prioritising the needs of Wall Street and corporate America over those of average people."", and would ""benefit corporate interests at the expense of hospitals, healthcare workers, cities and states"". Senator Elizabeth Warren, until recently a 2020 presidential candidate, told reporters that ""We're not here to create a slush fund for Donald Trump and his family, or a slush fund for the Treasury Department to be able to hand out to their friends"".

The summary of the bill, however, states that it provides funding for small businesses and individuals, which would seem to benefit the average person, and includes a raft of healthcare provisions, including ""additional funding for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19"", and ""limits [on] liability for volunteer health care professionals"" in order to help fight the disease.

Which provisions in the bill specifically are opponents of the bill objecting to? Which measures are seen as benefiting corporate America over individuals?
","Democrats have been trying to make the case that the stimulus package contains within it a corporate ""slush fund"" controlled by the Treasury Department and headed by Steve Mnuchin, and Democrats believe there is a high risk of mismanagement or outright corruption. From NYMag:


  The central flash point concerns a $500 billion corporate bailout. [...] 
  Its requirements that bailed-out firms protect their workers are too weak. (Protecting the workers is the whole rationale for bailing them out, after all — at least from the Democrats’ point of view.) More disturbing, it’s designed as a pool of money to be doled out by the Treasury secretary. That is to say, the money is, for all intents and purposes, personally controlled by Donald Trump, who selected the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, and could replace him on a whim. [...]
  One obvious outcome of this financing arrangement would be to create the all-but-certain outcome that the Treasury would select the Trump Organization as one of the worthy recipients of its largesse. Trump’s vacation properties have indeed been forced to shut down, and while an unbiased manager might not select the Trump Organization over needier coronavirus victims, Trump himself probably thinks differently. Indeed, at his press conference, the president did not even bring himself to deny that he might. “Let’s just see what happens,” he replied, as if the outcome might contain any mystery.


They also make the argument that the restrictions on the bailout fund that are in place to prevent some of the excesses by executives after the bailout of 2008 are weak, as are protections for workers who become unemployed. From Politico:


  According to a senior Democratic aide, the party's concerns with the GOP proposal center on $500 billion for corporations; stock buyback language that can be waived by the Treasury secretary; only a two-year time frame on executive compensation limits; and no provisions to protect individuals from eviction. [...] Democrats also object to what they say is an insufficient amount of money for state and local governments and providing only three months of unemployment insurance. Democrats initially asked for $750 billion in state aid, and Republicans have countered with far less.


A further complication for the bill is the behavior by many of these firms and how they chose to spend money saved by the GOP tax cut. Instead of using that money to create rainy day funds, they instead used that money to repurchase stock in order to inflate executive compensation to the detriment of their workers.

"It has been claimed in a fairly upvoted answer here (which is why this not a notable-enough claim for Skeptics SE) that


  For a fun exercise, put a news organization into google's search along with ""Wuhan Virus"" and scroll through a few pages of results. You'll find things generally split into two camps: 90% of the results are for recent articles which talk about racism/non-racism/etc of the term... and 10% of the results are for articles from Jan/Feb which use ""Wuhan Virus"" as the term of choice to describe the virus in a straight-forward manner. [...] So now the term ""Wuhan Virus"", which up until a month ago was a professional term, is full-out racist.


How much of the US media referred to COVID-19 as the ""Wuhan virus"" before it received an official WHO designation on February 11th? Basically, was this ""Wuhan virus"" (term) a common occurrence in the US media in Feb and Jan this year?
","Max Rissuto from DFRLab has analysed this in an article published on March 17th which tests the media bias claims made by Republican politicians including GOP House Leader Kevin McCarthy, who tweeted that ""Democrats are trying to score political points by calling Republicans racist"" and that the ""media called it 'Chinese coronavirus' for weeks"". While McCarthy uses the term 'Chinese coronavirus', Rissuto's analysis also includes the term 'Wuhan Virus'. It should be noted however that this analysis was performed on all English language publications, not just US-targeted media, and has only collected data up until March 10th.

DFRLab conducted a series of queries using a media monitoring tool to test the claim that media organizations are acting hypocritically in this way, gathering information about how geographic adjectives were used by the media to describe the disease before the official name of ""COVID-19"" was applied by the WHO. This data is summarized in the chart below.


(Source: @MaxBRizzuto/DFRLab)

From this data, we can see that the terms 'Wuhan Virus' &amp; 'Wuhan Coronavirus' both had widespread use in English language media from the end of January up until the WHO named the disease on February 11th. The usage was comparable to the usage of the terms 'China Virus', and less commonly, 'Chinese Coronavirus'. After this date, we see the usage fall away dramatically, albeit not entirely, up until the recent debacle surrounding the use of geographic adjectives by various US and international politicians. This could also be due to the fact that as the virus spread throughout China, publications that would have used 'Wuhan Virus' found 'China Virus' to be more accurate.

In conclusion then, while a significant proportion of articles used the term 'Wuhan Virus' prior to naming conventions for the disease being established, after this point most media outlets switched to using the official terminology. The usage of the term has seen a resurgence in the media recently due in part to publications reporting on some politician's continued use of this terminology.

"Romania has declared a state of emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has a few effects. Two of which I consider relevant for this questions are:


they limit some of people's rights (like the right to move freely, for ex);
some decisions can badly affect certain categories of people (lose jobs, unable to get access to care, difficulty in access food, for ex).


Old people are the most affected and in extreme situations. They might die not because of the virus, but because of decisions that are taken to slow down the progression of the virus, like being unable to access care, or medicine, or food because people are restricted in what they can do and health services are restricted in what cases they treat.

My question is this: If Romanian politicians take bad decisions, or police and military enforce bad decisions and this causes deaths that could have been avoided if they had more... ""common sense"" let's say... after the state of emergency ends, are they accountable for their actions? Or does anything go during a state of emergency with no consequences for those in power?
","The general answer to this, which applies in most democratic countries, is that governments are not legally responsible for ""bad"" decisions, whether made during a state of emergency or not. The main reasons for this are:


Who is to say what is a ""bad"" decision? It's rarely obvious, even with 20/20 hindsight, and the general view is that the electorate is responsible for deciding, which means:
the redress for governments who make bad decisions is that at the next election the people will vote them out.


That said, a state of emergency does not mean ""anything goes"". Governments are still responsible for illegal actions. If a government ordered random shootings of innocent people in the street that would still be illegal, even in a state of emergency, and any soldier who carried out such an action could be prosecuted. A state of emergency extends what is legal, but doesn't extend it indefinitely. It might be legal to force the closure of businesses in a state of emergency, but not to kill random people.
"
"In the US Senate on Sunday, March 22nd, passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was blocked in a 47-47 vote. The vote was generally along party lines, with one exception: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell voted against the cloture measure alongside the Democrats, despite arguing forcefully for the passage of the bill. I've noticed this with other bills and with Harry Reid before McConnell, so it's not just this bill – it seems like a more common pattern.

Why would the Senate Majority leader vote against cloture on a bill that they support? Is it a procedural issue?
","While looking for more examples of this process, I stumbled upon the answer.  

Why is Harry Reid always voting against his own plans?


  Forty U.S. senators voted to block a final vote on Chuck Hagel's nomination to be defense secretary. Of those, 39 were Republicans opposed to the nomination, at least for the moment. The other was Harry Reid. It wasn't that Reid opposed Hagel — far from it. ...
  
  So what gives? In articles like the one I wrote on the Hagel filibuster, the short explanation we give is that Reid voted no ""for procedural reasons"" or because a no vote ""allows him to bring another cloture vote in the future."" ...
  
  As Sarah Binder, a Senate rules expert at George Washington University, told me, it's not that the majority leader has to vote no. It's that somebody on the winning side of the cloture vote — in this case, the side voting against cloture — has to file a ""motion to reconsider"" if the matter is to be taken up again. ""I suppose the broader parliamentary principle here is that it would be somewhat unfair to give someone on the losing side of a question a second bite at the apple,"" Binder explains. So the rules provide for senators whose opinion has changed to motion for another vote, whereas those whose opinion stays the same don't get to keep filing to reconsider.
  
  Reid, and other majority leaders before him, have developed a clever workaround: Just change your vote at the last minute if it looks as though you're going to lose, then move to reconsider. In theory, any supporter of the bill or nomination in question could do the same, but traditionally it's been the majority leader.


Senate rules say that after a failed cloture vote (ie. the bill did not get the 60 votes needed to overrule a filibuster), a ""Motion to Reconsider"" (that is, a second attempt at cloture) can only be called by a member of the winning side of the vote.

"Coronavirus has forced the French government to postpone the second round of local elections:


  France will postpone the second round of mayoral elections to June 21 due to the coronavirus outbreak, two political sources told Reuters on Monday.
  
  Sources also said that the results of first round of local elections on Sunday would remain valid.


However, nobody really knows how long SARS-CoV-2 will be a major issue. Theoretically, the desired scenario implies mitigating the infections over a large period of time to allow the medical system to cope with the patients. 

I am wondering if the second round can be postponed indefinitely.

Question: Is there a limit to how long the second round of French mayoral elections can be postponed?
","There is no limit because there is also no provision for that. Article L56 of the code électoral even provides that:


  En cas de deuxième tour de scrutin, il y est procédé le dimanche suivant le premier tour.


In other words, any run-off has to take place the week after the first round of voting.

But, absent any constitutional provision to the contrary, anything and everything that is defined in a statute can in principle be undone by the parliament. Postponing the run-off at the last minute is a very ad hoc solution, not something that would be part of a well-defined procedure.

At this point, the government rescinded the décret calling the election and the parliament (both chambers) adopted a statute dealing with several issues arising from this (what to do with the results, etc.) In fact, that statute also extends the term of all town councils that haven't been replaced, as it could otherwise be deemed to expire.

It also provides that before setting a new date the government must publish the conclusions of its advisory scientific committee and that if it turns out to be impossible to organise the run-off in June then the election would be completely cancelled and the process should be restarted from scratch (new candidates, new ballots, new campaign, etc.)

Obviously, from a purely legal point of view, all these dispositions are also liable to be changed at any time should the parliament agree to do so.

"As we know that US government announced $2T Covid-19 stimulus package on March 24. It includes a payout of $1200 to all taxpayers. 

Who are the individuals who will get that benefit? Is it all US Taxpayers or only US Citizens? Will a resident alien on work visa, who pays taxes, get that benefit as well?
","No, you do not have to prove your citizenship, because the payment is not only for US citizens. It is for all US citizens or ""resident aliens"" for tax purposes, who have a Social Security Number, make less than the income threshold (it phases out at an AGI of between $75,000 and $99,000 for single filers and $150,000 and $198,000 for joint filers), and cannot be claimed by someone else as a dependent on their taxes.

The recovery rebates are provided in the CARES Act (text here), section 2201. The parts that limit eligibility for the rebate are the following:

The income limitation:


  (c) Limitation based on adjusted gross income.—The amount of the
  credit allowed by subsection (a) (determined without regard to this
  subsection and subsection (e)) shall be reduced (but not below zero)
  by 5 percent of so much of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income as
  exceeds—
  
  (1) $150,000 in the case of a joint return,
  
  (2) $112,500 in the case of a head of household, and
  
  (3) $75,000 in the case of a taxpayer not described in paragraph (1)
  or (2).


Disallowing it to nonresident aliens, people who can be claimed as dependents, and estates and trusts:


  (d) Eligible individual.—For purposes of this section, the term
  ‘eligible individual’ means any individual other than—
  
  (1) any nonresident alien individual,
  
  (2) any individual with respect to whom a deduction under section 151
  is allowable to another taxpayer for a taxable year beginning in the
  calendar year in which the individual’s taxable year begins, and
  
  (3) an estate or trust.


And disallowing it to people who don't have a Social Security Number (or whose spouses don't have a Social Security Number if filing jointly):


  (g) Identification number requirement.—
  
  (1) IN GENERAL.—No credit shall be allowed under subsection (a) to an
  eligible individual who does not include on the return of tax for the
  taxable year—
  
  (A) such individual’s valid identification number,
  
  (B) in the case of a joint return, the valid identification number of
  such individual’s spouse, and
  
  (C) in the case of any qualifying child taken into account under
  subsection (a)(2), the valid identification number of such qualifying
  child.
  
  (2) VALID IDENTIFICATION NUMBER.—
  
  (A) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of paragraph (1), the term ‘valid
  identification number’ means a social security number (as such term is
  defined in section 24(h)(7)).
  
  (B) ADOPTION TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER.—For purposes of paragraph
  (1)(C), in the case of a qualifying child who is adopted or placed for
  adoption, the term ‘valid identification number’ shall include the
  adoption taxpayer identification number of such child.
  
  (3) SPECIAL RULE FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES.—Paragraph (1)(B)
  shall not apply in the case where at least 1 spouse was a member of
  the Armed Forces of the United States at any time during the taxable
  year and at least 1 spouse satisfies paragraph (1)(A).
  
  (4) MATHEMATICAL OR CLERICAL ERROR AUTHORITY.—Any omission of a
  correct valid identification number required under this subsection
  shall be treated as a mathematical or clerical error for purposes of
  applying section 6213(g)(2) to such omission.


To answer your question, someone on a work visa will almost certainly qualify for the payment if their income is below the threshold, because they are ""resident aliens"" for tax purposes since they pass the Substantial Presence Test (except maybe if they arrived this year), and they have Social Security Numbers.

"Subsequent to the Democrats blocking the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in the US Senate on Sunday, March 22nd, in a 47-47 vote that was split along party lines, Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats released their own counter-proposal titled the Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act.

what were the Republican objections to the counter-proposal?
","House Republican Whip Steve Scalise has given a press release which outlines the objections of Republicans to the bill, calling it a wishlist of ""insane far-left policies"". The objections in particular seem to relate to the amount of non-coronavirus related provisions within the bill. Republicans argue that these measures are unnecessary, and an abuse of the pressure currently on Congress to come up with a rescue package.

I won't reproduce the whole list of provisions that Scalise has picked out as objectionable, but they include environmental reform policies, an increase to the minimum wage, a law to force companies to disclose board of director diversity statistics, and a requirement that unions should have a seat on airline corporate boards. Many of these policies seem tangentially related, if at all, to the COVID-19 crisis.

These concerns have been echoed by other Republican groups, such as the Republican House Oversight Committee, who tweeted:


  Speaker Pelosi's #coronavirus bill includes: 
  
  
  Provisions for a federal takeover of elections
  A climate change study on aviation
  Intrusive corporate diversity reporting burdens
  
  
  Seriously? Now is the time to help struggling Americans, not play
  swamp politics with virus aid.


USA Today has published an opinion piece by James S. Robbins on the bill, which describes it as a ""Christmas in March for liberal special interests"". In particular, Robbins takes umbrage with the changes that would be made to elections:


  Perhaps the most troubling sections of the bill are under the rubric
  ‘‘American Coronavirus/COVID–19 Election Safety and Security” or
  ‘‘ACCESS” Act. This section would impose requirements on states for
  early voting, voting by mail, required mailing of absentee ballots to
  everyone, ballot harvesting (i.e., having third parties deliver
  absentee ballots), online voter registration, same-day registration
  and other practices which undermine confidence in the integrity of the
  ballot. In these days of increasing threats to election security we
  should be moving rapidly back to in-person paper ballots, but this
  bill would be a radical step in the wrong direction.

"A part of this answer got me wondering if another state can request compensations over the huge economical cost of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics:


  (..) the region (HK, Singapore, SK?, China) was hit much harder during the 2003 SARS epidemic so spent more time getting prepared.
  
  (..) it has long been the expectation that the next epidemic would come out of China, both due to population density and proximity to livestock/wild animals, so those countries could expect another ""gift"" from their Chinese neighbors.


Theoretically it can be argued that China could have tackle ""the proximity to livestock/wild animals"" to avoid another pandemic. 

Is it possible for a country to ask for compensation over a pandemic started in another country. Or a pandemic is assimilated to a naturally occurring event regardless of context?

Question: Is it possible for a country to ask for compensation over damage done by SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that most likely started in China?
","First, let's address the biological point. China is not 'responsible' for this novel coronavirus or the pandemic it is generating. Viruses are constantly mutating, and all it takes to begin an epidemic is for one person to encounter one animal that has a mutated strain of a virus, a strain which can jump species and start transmitting itself human to human. Humans are social creatures; they will have social contact and pass the strain on to others. Of course, being in a densely packed region with exposure to livestock increases the odds of that kind of encounter and maximizes the rate of transmission — lots of people nearby to infect, so the disease doesn't have to work its way outward — but that is a condition of poverty as much as anything else. People living on marginal incomes will pack together and bring their livestock with them, because they cannot afford the luxuries of personal space or shipped-in food.

And frankly, while poverty exacerbates diseases, it does not create them. The next pandemic could just as easily start because some well-to-do American on his country estate gets shat on by an infected bird. Novel infections are a natural phenomenon. We are not immune to the workings of nature (despite our pretensions) so epidemics will happen on a rare but regular basis. Blaming a particular region for a pandemic is like blaming your neighbor because you got crabgrass in your lawn. Crabgrass doesn't know, or care, whose lawn it is.

This 'neighbor' example is a good analogy for the problem this question faces. Currently, all states are treated as sovereign, like a neighborhood of houses in which each homeowner has absolute say over what he gets to do with his house and yard. There is no overarching governance: no courts, no police, no administrators, no higher authority to appeal to, to force a neighbor to do this or that on his property. The UN is like a town hall in which people come together to argue and make resolutions, but it has no real teeth except as individual sovereigns agree to abide by its decisions. This leaves only a few options on the table:


Shrug and ignore what other sovereign homeowners do on their own turf, implicitly accepting the bad things that might float over the fence into one's own yard (i.e., the status quo).
Try to create agreements that commit all parties to certain kinds of behavior (i.e. pacts and treaties): a slow and difficult process to begin with, and one that any sovereign can back out of at any convenient-for-them time.
Restrict the ability of particular sovereign homeowners to interact with the community, in the hopes that deprivation will force them into compliance (i.e., sanctions, embargoes, etc.).
Create independent, unaligned groups that ask permission to enter another's sovereign territory to solve particular problems before they spread (i.e, NGO's and such). Note that sovereign homeowners are under no obligation to allow such groups access, and can interfere with such groups' work in any way they desire.
Force your way onto another's sovereign territory to solve the problem against that sovereign's will (i.e., war).


So long as we maintain the decrepit ideal of sovereign nations, there's not much we can do to prevent the spread of a disease through a nation and across its borders. There is nothing at all we can do to prevent the birth of a novel disease. And unless we are willing to address underlying social issues like poverty and overpopulation, we are as much to blame as anyone else for pandemics of this sort, so there is no point in trying to collect 'compensation' for some imagined wrongdoing we project onto others.

"News about Romania's COVID-19-driven, reverse diaspora:


  Over 200,000 Romanians who worked abroad have returned to the country since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, with many of them coming from those EU countries strongly affected by the pandemic, PM Ludovic Orban said on Friday [March 27].
  
  “On February 25 there was only one case in Romania, two cases of coronavirus in Spain, and several others in France. Look at the number of cases in Romania, less over 1,000, and if we also take into the account the cured ones, we have below 1,000 patients with COVID-19, while there are tens of thousands of infections in other countries. Romania has taken serious measures from the start”, the premier stated.
  
  Besides, he underlined that Romania had another particularity as against the other countries, namely that over 200,000 Romanians from Diaspora returned to the homeland. “If we had not taken severe containment measures, be it quarantine or isolation, the spread would have been larger”, Orban added.


How did Romania manage to quarantine 200,000 people returning from abroad (if I understand correctly that's what they did)? What specific enforcement measures did they take?
","I don't have a complete list of all the measures taken, but in large strokes, the following things happened:


schools were closed very soon after the first cases of covid-19 were discovered;
large gatherings of people were prohibited (not more than 100, then after some period not more than 50);
a state of emergency was declared when there were relatively few cases of infections compared to the population number;
a lot of local districts started to take actions on their own, like closing public parks.
the private sector also took action. Companies encouraged employees to work from home, sporting events were canceled, stores changed their program or limit the number of shoppers at any given time, hypermarkets started to disinfect their shopping carts and protect their cashiers with glass windows, trains in the subway station would pull only one by one at the platform to limit the number of passengers that would gather together.
because a state of emergency was declared, new laws were passed to control what people were doing. First there were restrictions to be on the streets between 22:00 and 06:00. This lasted for a few days, then restrictions were put in place all day. Now or example you are not allowed to exit the home unless for some specific reasons like buying food, seek medical help, take care of elderly people, go to work, and a few others. People above 65 are not allowed to go out of their home unless they have an emergency. For other activities they are only allowed to go out between 11:00 and 13:00. Stores reinforce this by allowing only the elderly to shop in that time interval. Now all parks are closed. And groups of more than 3 people are disallowed. All shops and malls that don't sell food or things you need to survive were closed.


These are a few things that happened since the whole covid-19 cases started to happen in Romania.

Now, to your question. Because we are in a state of emergency the law was changed to account for the pandemic situation. If you have returned from abroad you need to go into self-isolation or you are placed under quarantine (for 14 days if I remember correctly). You are not allowed to leave your house and friends, family or couriers must provide you with food and supplies. You don't interact with them, they just leave them at the door. If you do not respect these measures, the fines are now very large, up to 20000 RON (more than 4000 EUR), and you can also go to jail. If you breach self-isolation or quarantine and you are discovered, you are being placed under military guard so you don't do it again.

Now, with that being said, you can't really monitor 200000 people or keep them in check. There are controls, but you can't really keep them isolated. Many were discovered wondering the streets, going to parties, visiting friends, etc by the authorities. It helps I guess that there is some panic and people will report those that they know came from abroad and are not sitting put (mothers have reported their children to the authorities, for examples).

So basically that's what's happening right now. We have lower cases of infections than other countries because everyone reacted quickly and took measures before things were bad. Because movement is restricted this limits contact between persons. People also isolated themselves in the houses by precaution before the state of emergency was declared (for example, a few days before the state of emergency was declared, people hit the stores and bought all the flour and yeast, rice, canned produce, etc to stay in home for weeks) because of worry, fear, panic.

For further reference, some details on the infection in Romania:

https://instnsp.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/5eced796595b4ee585bcdba03e30c127

(on the left, in red are the total confirmed cases, in yellow are persons under quarantine, blue is people in isolation at home, in gray are the number of deceased people)

My belief is that authorities panicked when they saw what was happening in Italy for example (many Romanians live there and return for Easter Holiday each year) so they took harsh measures before  it was needed. It seems it helped. Although they also took some bad decisions like limiting access to information (in the name of having it from official sources). I don't remember exactly, but I think that link above is from independently collected data, as authorities no longer report cases per district, but only globally.

EDIT: as a response to your comment I've looked up a few examples in the media:

1. In the first day of restrictions of circulation, 5,621 persons who did not comply with the measures were fined 7,404,297 RON (1,531,965 EUR). That's an average of 1,317 RON (272 EUR) per person.

2. In later news, the number of people who did not comply with the restrictions of circulation and were fined increased to 23,973, and an amount of 31,400,000 RON (6,496,730 EUR). That's an average of 1309 RON (270 EUR) per person. The same news mentions that for 209 persons a criminal record was opened and 4,235 were fined for non-compliance with the isolation/quarantine measures.

3. The news in point 2 did not mention how much the fines were for those that did not comply with isolation/quarantine, but in older news, 10 days ago, on the Ministry of Health's website it was stated that 1,835,000 RON (379,665 EUR) of fines were applied to 120 persons for not respecting the measure of isolation. That's an average of 15,291 RON (3,163 EUR) per person.

So the fines for breaking isolation/quarantine are quite large (plus getting a criminal record for more severe situations). For reference, the minimum net wage in Romania is 1,346 RON (278 EUR) while the average net wage is 3,189 RON (659 EUR). So for a large number of people, the fines are quite large.

"I would expect US pro-life groups to simultaneously support Trump (as they're typically right-leaning), yet simultaneously strongly against his death-permissive approach to bolster the economy during the COVID-19 crisis.


  WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.
  US President Donald Trump, via Twitter


Given that ""the problem"" includes large numbers of deaths, the US President is currently making a trade-off of human lives for the economy.  This seems to give rise to a conundrum for US pro-life groups.

Question: How have US pro-life groups responded to Trump's stance during the COVID-19 crisis, given that this stance could permit more deaths?

A National Review article seems to indicate pro-life groups are reconciling the deaths by arguing that a poor economy will also lead to deaths, but even Republican politicians are arguing that large numbers of dead people will hurt the economy:


  There will be no normally functioning economy if our hospitals are overwhelmed and thousands of Americans of all ages, including our doctors and nurses, lay dying because we have failed to do what’s necessary to stop the virus.
  Rep. Liz Cheney, via Twitter


So it's unclear to me how US pro-life groups can reconcile this.
","There's nothing to reconcile. Pro-life doesn't mean 'against (needless) death', it means anti-abortion. [The same is true for the opposite label: Pro-choice means in favor of legal access to abortion, not necessarily in favor of all individual choices (eg regarding assisted suicide or drug policies).]  

People supporting ""Pro-life"" can still support the death penalty, wars, restricted access to healthcare (for the poor), terrorist attacks against abortion providers, denial of healthcare to pregnant women even in case of a non-viable fetus, etc.

Response to the lax attitude regarding human life has been minimal, as that is not their issue; abortions are. The focus during this crisis by anti-abortion groups seems to be to further attack legal access to abortion. The SBA List coronavirus page or the Live Action news page eg focus on denying access to abortion &amp; defunding abortion providers during the crisis.

The few responses I was able to find are not from groups, but individuals, and seem to argue in the same direction as you mention: Relativizing the deaths by downplaying the risk &amp; impact and saying that a weak economy will also have a price. Eg:  


  economic hardship without a clear path to recovery imperils lives too (as evidence by a 300% spike in calls to the National Suicide Prevention Hotline); [...] targeted isolation of and care for the elderly is entirely possible while allowing the younger and healthier to go about their lives.


Others take a more utilitarian approach, weighing the ""lives saved"" due to denied access to abortion during the crisis vs deaths from coronavirus.

At least some individual people who hold anti-abortion views have opposed the economy > life view. The following quote is attributed to Rep. Cheney, though I was only able to find it by Erick Erickson:


  Letting the virus spread to your parents and grandparents to protect your 401k is not pro-life.


Russell Moore argues along the same lines in a NYT opinion piece, though without explicitly mentioning abortion or ""pro-life"".

"SARS-CoV-2 infection managed to bring a significant part of the economy to a halt and it is expected for lots of companies to have cash flows problems (e.g. impossible to pay the suppliers). I have recently saw a Romanian economist speaking about this issue and I was wondering how US and EU are dealing with this.

The European Central Bank decided to buy €750 billion worth of bonds while the US is considering printing more dollars (my emphasis).


  The extraordinary actions of the Federal Reserve on Monday morning can be boiled down to two sentences: There is a rapidly developing shortage of dollars across the economy. And the Fed will do anything it needs to, on any scale imaginable, to end this shortage.
  
  Its announcement was phrased in the dry bureaucratese typical of statements from a central bank. But it contains a powerful idea. The Fed, the one entity in the world with the power to create dollars out of thin air, has every intention of doing so at whatever magnitude is necessary to try to reduce the severity and limit the duration of the coronavirus economic crisis.


I am wondering why the Fed can print dollars while ECB cannot print Euros. Especially considering the ""desperate times"" of the new SARS.

Question: Can the European Central Bank ""print money"" to partially mitigate the economical effects of the coronavirus infection spreading?
","The Fed is the central bank of the United States, which is one nation despite the plural form in their name. 

The ECB is the central bank of some (but not all) EU nations, and their operation is based on an international treaty. What the ECB can and cannot do is spelled out in that treaty, and the member states could always modify the treaty if they consider that appropriate.


The ECB can effectively print money by buying Eurozone government debt. 
When the ECB was set up, the public in certain nations (notably Germany) was worried that the ECB would do that and tried to put safeguards into place.

"Today, Hungary's parliament voted by 137 to 53 to enact the new COVID-19 bill, which apparently grants Prime Minister Viktor Orbán sweeping powers, in order to allow Hungary to deal with the crisis. The move, which includes no time limit on the extraordinary powers has been criticised by the Council of Europe; the Secretary General wrote in an letter to Mr Orbán that although ""drastic measures"" need to be taken:


  An indefinite and uncontrolled state of emergency cannot guarantee
  that the basic principles of democracy will be observed and that the
  emergency measures restricting fundamental human rights are strictly
  proportionate to the threat which they are supposed to counter.


Although there has been much criticism of the bill,  I have been unable to find precise details of the powers which it grants to Orbán and his government. What specific rights are being curtailed that the bill's critics find objectionable?
","The implications seem to be indefinite near-dictatorship for so long as Viktor Orbán chooses.  For those who are interested, an (unofficial, I believe) English translation of the bill can be found here.

Under the new legislation, by-elections are suspended and Orbán can rule by decree, suspend enforcement of laws, and arrest people for years under vague charges of ""publicizing distorted facts"" or ""violating quarantine"":


  The Hungarian parliament on Monday voted by a two-thirds majority to allow the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree without a set time limit.
  
  While the new legislation remains in place, no by-elections can be held and Orbán's government will be able to suspend the enforcement of certain laws. Plus, individuals who publicize what are viewed as untrue or distorted facts — and which could interfere with the protection of the public, or could alarm or agitate a large number of people — now face several years in jail.


Though advertised as ""emergency powers"", these new powers will last indefinitely and can only be removed with the approval of the President:


  The new rules can only be lifted with another two-thirds vote of the parliament and a presidential signature
  
  Hungary’s Viktor Orbán wins vote to rule by decree - Politico


The New York Times provides similar information:


  In Hungary, a new law has granted Prime Minister Viktor Orban the power to sidestep Parliament and suspend existing laws. Mr. Orban, who declared a state of emergency this month, now has the sole power to end the emergency. ...
  
  The law will permanently amend two articles of the criminal code that will further limit freedom of expression and penalize people for breaching quarantine orders. It will also suspend all elections and referendums.
  
  Under one measure, anyone who disseminates information that could hinder the government’s response to the epidemic could face up to five years in prison. The legislation gives broad latitude to the public prosecutor to determine what counts as distorted or false information.
  
  For Autocrats, Coronavirus Is a Chance to Grab Even More Power - The New York Times




The Independent Hungarian newspaper Index has more detail.

The government can expand emergency declarations indefinitely without Parliamentary approval:


  The new law allows the government to make these extensions themselves indefinitely, or at least until Parliament decides to revoke this authorisation before the state of emergency is over


It gives the government vague and expansive powers to arrest people for ""false or distorting"" speech:


  The new law also introduces a vaguely worded new paragraph to the already existing offence of scaremongering in the Criminal Code, which opponents of the law say could threaten critical press:
  
  
    ""Anyone who, under a special legal order, in public, utters or spreads statements known to be false or statements distorting true facts shall be punishable by imprisonment between 1 to 5 years if done in a manner capable of hindering or derailing the effectiveness of the response effort.""
  


And it give them the power to suspend laws and cancel elections:


  The Coronavirus Act also introduces a number of other changes to the constitutional order of the country:
  
  
  The government will be allowed to take steps beyond the extraordinary measures listed in the Disaster Relief Act and suspend the application of certain laws by decree if necessary and proportional to protect citizens' health, life, property, rights, and to secure the stability of the economy in connection with the pandemic. ...
  No local or national elections or referendums can be held until the end of the state of emergency, elections and referendums already scheduled will take place after the special legal order ends. Municipal councils dissolved during the state of emergency stay in place until the end of the special legal order.

"I saw a recent news article about President Trump, forcing car makers to make ventilators. 

In the US there also a significant shortage of toilet paper, which seem to be a supply and demand problem.  People want more than the available supply. 

Can the president increase toilet paper supplies?  
","President Trump was able to do that with ventilators because of the Defense Production Act:


  On March 18, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, President Trump issued an executive order that defined ventilators and protective equipment as ""essential to the national defense"", the standard required by the DPA.[17][18] Later that day, he indicated that he would not make immediate use of DPA authority, writing, ""Hopefully there will be no need""; he indicated that he would do so in a ""worst-case scenario"".[19][20] Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called upon Trump to ""immediately use the powers of the DPA to mass produce and coordinate distribution of"" critically needed hospital equipment such as ventilators, swabs, and personal protective equipment.[19][20] On March 20, Trump said that he will use the DPA.[21] General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra spoke to Trump administration officials about how GM could support production of ventilators.[22] On March 23, Trump issued an executive order classifying ""health and medical resources necessary to respond to the spread of COVID-19"" as subject to the authority granted by DPA to prohibit hoarding and price gouging.[23][24] Trump's continued reluctance to use the act's authorities prompted further criticism.[25] On March 27, 2020, after negotiations with GM to produce ventilators had broken down over cost, which was being estimated at over $1 billion, but primarily due to GM’s uncertainty as to its ability to provide the number of ventilators required speedily, Trump ordered HHS Secretary Alex Azar to use the authority available under the DPA to require GM to accept and prioritize contracts for the number of ventilators that Azar determines to be appropriate.[26] Trump also named Peter Navarro national policy coordinator for the DPA.[27]


For Trump to do this for toilet paper, he would need to declare it vital to national defense. That seems kind of silly to me, but I recon he could do that. It has been done for ""aerospace structures"":


  In June 13, 2017, President Donald Trump invoked the law to classify as ""critical to national defense"" two sets of products. The first referenced ""items affecting aerospace structures and fibers, radiation-hardened microelectronics, radiation test and qualification facilities, and satellite components and assemblies"".[13][14]

"In this article, it's claimed that 20% of the US thinks the US is handling the COVID-19 outbreak better than South Korea, 21% think it's about the same, 26% think it's worse, and 32% aren't sure. This is something I find surprising, since for the metrics I've been looking at, South Korea is doing better in every way:



It seems obvious that the 41% of people who think the US is doing as well as or better than South Korea are looking at different metrics than me, and I'd like to know what these other metrics are.

NB: I'm focusing on South Korea because although the original article also says the majority of Americans polled thinks the US outperforms China/Italy, there is a metric that I'm already aware of (total deaths, and in the case of Italy, total cases/deaths per capita) for which the US is doing better than those countries at the time of the poll, so if total deaths is what matters for most Americans then it's defensible to say the US is doing better. I'm not aware of any such metric for South Korea, however, which is why I'm asking.

Alternatively, what else can explain the US poll data?
","The key assumption you have made is assuming people in the US act sensibly, and that they would base their answer in the poll on facts. This assumption might not be accurate. A recent (Jan 2019) study shows that facts might not be too important in this matter [1].


  Inaccurate views of scientific consensus and the willful rejection of scientific consensus.
  In a 2014 US survey (15), two-thirds of respondents (67%) thought that scientists did “not have a clear understanding about the health effects of GM crops,” despite broad scientific consensus on the topic (16). Similarly, half of Americans (52%) thought scientists were “divided” in the belief that the universe was created in the Big Bang, and about a third each thought that scientists were divided on anthropogenic climate change (37%) and evolution (29%). Of course, these data do not make clear the cause of these inaccurate views, which, arguably, could stem from people being uninformed, intentionally misinformed, or a bit of both.
  
  Furthermore, split-ballot survey experiments have shown that even when Americans do seem to possess accurate knowledge of scientific consensus (however large or small that number may be for a given issue) there is no guarantee that they will integrate that knowledge into their attitudes or policy preferences (17). In other words, these respondents know what the scientific community has established as fact, but they nonetheless refuse to “know” it. Some have therefore argued that rejection of scientifically accurate accounts of the Big Bang or evolution by nonexpert audiences indicates neither a lack of information about scientific consensus nor the presence of misinformation, but, rather, motivated information processing (18). (Highlight mine).


Given that the current US government places little value on facts and that ""Make America Great Again"" was a slogan in the last election, I find it highly plausible that this is a factor here, too - that a certain amount of people simply want to believe that the US is the best in the world in everything, despite facts showing otherwise.

The study also finds:


  When such directional goals influence reasoning processes, individuals are prone to “biased assimilation,” which is characterized by confirmation and disconfirmation bias, or the parallel tendencies to privilege information that is consistent with one’s predispositions and to discredit information that seems contradictory (51). As with selective exposure, motivated reasoning can contribute to an individual becoming misinformed, and it can occur not only in political contexts but also when individuals process information about science and emerging technologies (52–54).


If you want to believe the US is #1 in everything, this seems to be a highly relevant point.

Also, emotional state can be an important factor. And I think we can agree that the current crisis is a very emotional matter, and that believing the US is doing better than anyone else might be reassuring, even if it isn't based on truth.


  The role of emotion.
  This brings us to discussions of the influence of affect in motivated reasoning processes. There is some evidence that a person’s emotional state can shape the accuracy of his or her beliefs. [...] Notably, individuals’ attraction to emotionally charged content is not limited to politics, and even when it comes to scientific discoveries, individuals are more inclined to spread information that has a greater emotional impact (59).


1: Scheufele, Dietram A, and Nicole M Krause. “Science audiences, misinformation, and fake news.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America vol. 116,16 (2019): 7662-7669. doi:10.1073/pnas.1805871115



So I think the answer is not that there are any objective metrics that show that the US is handling the crisis better in any way. The fatality rate is magnitudes higher (although it is too early to tell what the toll will be in the end), cases per capita are higher, total cases are higher, et cetera. I don't think there are those metrics that you are looking for. I rather think think it simply shows that a large percentage of the US population is either uninformed or misinformed, for various reasons as outlined above.



From the survey that was linked in the question, we can also see that the opinion on how the US is handling it relative to the rest of the world varies dramatically with the political orientation of the respondent, which would further back up that political orientation plays a significant role in how people perceive facts and responded.



The poll data for the question relative to South Korea is roughly in the same boat, polarization-wise. Only about 6% of Republicans say the US is doing worse than South Korea, whereas 45% of Democrats say that:

"This article describes the efforts of several European Union countries to agree to issue ""corona bonds"" or ""Eurobonds"", which are a joint EU mechanism to issue joint debt shared between different countries. This measure is being proposed in order to ""mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus"". It says:


  “We need to recognize the severity of the situation and the necessity
  for further action to buttress our economies today,” the heads of
  state of Italy, France, Belgium, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Ireland,
  Slovenia and Luxembourg said Wednesday in a joint letter seen by CNBC.
  
  [...]
  
  “We need to work on a common debt instrument issued by a European
  institution to raise funds on the market on the same basis and to the
  benefits of all Member States,” the nine heads of state said.


Given that there doesn't seem to be any restriction on European Union countries issuing their own government bonds, what are the benefits of these new proposed instruments over this conventional measure?
","Expanding on the answer by Tin Nguyen, the Euro is a a common currency for nations with separate economic policies and separate national debts. Being a member of the Eurozone stops nations from devaluating their currency to compensate for changing economic fundamentals.

Before and during the 2007 financial crisis bonds from e.g. Greece or Italy had a risk premium compared to German bonds despite the fact that both were government bonds in the same currency. There were even signs that futures traders were driving this premium up by betting against certain governments, or on nations leaving the Eurozone. The famous ""whatever it takes"" speech by Draghi calmed that.

The financial consequences of the Corona pandemic are not yet known, but it is clear that Italy and Spain will be hit hard. That will increase the risk on a default on national debt which increases the interest which investors demand. Of course that further hinders economic recovery.

If the Eurozone members jointly guarantee bonds, that lowers the interest payments for the less stable economies and possibly increases the interest for the more stable ones. This might or might not be to the benefit of the EU as a whole and the stronger members individually (since they all benefit from a strong Eurozone), but the more or less clearly voiced suspicion is that Corona is used as an excuse to enact a permanent transfer mechanism.

"On March 27th, President Trump signed the COVID-19 stimulus bill, the CARES Act, into law. This came after days of debate, where Democratic lawmakers insisted on the inclusion of oversight measures before they would agree to pass the bill. A few hours after signing the act into law, the White House released a signing statement, where the President takes issue with several provisions in the bill, and states his administration's intent to treat some of these provisions as advisory or hortatory. 

Of particular interest is the following paragraph:


  Section 4018 of Division A of the Act establishes a new Special
  Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) within the Department
  of the Treasury to manage audits and investigations of loans and
  investments made by the Secretary of the Treasury under the Act. 
  Section 4018(e)(4)(B) of the Act authorizes the SIGPR to request
  information from other government agencies and requires the SIGPR to
  report to the Congress “without delay” any refusal of such a request
  that “in the judgment of the Special Inspector General” is
  unreasonable.  I do not understand, and my Administration will not
  treat, this provision as permitting the SIGPR to issue reports to the
  Congress without the presidential supervision required by the Take
  Care Clause, Article II, section 3.


This implies that the new position of Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) will be unable to perform their duties, as the President apparently reserves the right to supervise, and potentially suppress, any reports that the Special Inspector will attempt to make to Congress.

Is the President able to effectively nullify these provisions of the bill unilaterally, or does this signing statement have no legal weight until tested in the courts? Are any oversight mechanisms aside from this Special Investigator available to Congress?
","Signing statements do not have the force of law. Most often signing statements are used to signify how the President will interpret and enforce the law


  For example, in President Obama's signing statement for the [National Defense Authorization Act], he explained a few reasons why he chose to sign the bill (it authorizes funding for important national defense programs, etc.), then went on to point out a few sections of the bill that he viewed as unconstitutional. He then stated, ""My Administration will interpret them [some of the disputed sections] to avoid the constitutional conflict.""


In other words, signing statements are often just a different way to enact an Executive Order.

Going back to this bill, the relevant portion would be


  I do not understand, and my Administration will not treat, this provision as permitting the SIGPR to issue reports to the Congress without the presidential supervision required by the Take Care Clause, Article II, section 3.


This doesn't nullify the law, it simply says the SIGPR should not report to Congress without reporting to the President first. This does provide Trump with a preview of any report and a potential to influence the SIGPR, but there's no easy way to stop this since the SIGPR is part of the Executive Branch. Nowhere is Trump stating that the SIGPR is not to report to Congress at all (which would be a direct violation of the law).

"According to statistics published by the FBI, March 2020 saw the highest ever number of NICS firearms background checks performed, at 3,740,688, an increase of 33% from February. The FBI itself notes that this does not equate to a one-to-one correlation to the number of gun sales that have taken place, but it is at least a rough indicator that the number of gun sales has also seen a large increase.

This trend held true in practically every state of the US, with the exception of Kentucky.

What are the political factors which have led to such a large increase? Clearly, as the main news story currently is the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems likely that this has had an effect, but it's unclear to me why this would lead to such a higher rate of gun background checks/purchases, especially as lockdowns start to reduce footfall at non-private sales locations.
","There's a lot of panicked buying going on in general

It's become a joke how much people are hoarding toilet paper (in the US, in particular, it wasn't hard to find before this). But hoarding things is part of a broader issue (emphasis mine)


  Australia has also suffered from panic buying of toilet paper despite plentiful domestic supply. A risk expert in the country explained it this way: ""Stocking up on toilet paper is … a relatively cheap action, and people like to think that they are 'doing something' when they feel at risk.""
  
  This is an example of ""zero risk bias,"" in which people prefer to try to eliminate one type of possibly superficial risk entirely rather than do something that would reduce their total risk by a greater amount.
  
  Hoarding also makes people feel secure. This is especially relevant when the world is faced with a novel disease over which all of us have little or no control. However, we can control things like having enough toilet paper in case we are quarantined.


Guns still mean security to a lot of people

Guns are still a powerful way to protect oneself, and more than a few people fear social breakdown, despite the fact that no place in the US has suspended their police force due to the pandemic, nor are there widespread shortages of police. As such, people want weapons to stop intruders


  Hyatt said that the type of guns being bought was reflective of the fear prevalent among customers. There was almost no interest in hunting rifles. Instead, people were opting for target guns and there was big demand for AR-15 semi-automatic assault-style rifles.
  
  Asked why he thought the spike was happening, Hyatt replied: ""Financial meltdown, pandemic, crime, politics … you throw it all into the pot, and you have one hell of a mess.""

"There has been a question here about the job approval rating of Trump in this Covid-19 pandemic. (Slight increase.)

I wonder how the governor and mayor of US most affected US state &amp; city, that is NYC (and NY state) are doing in the opinion polls lately.
","Both of them, but particularly Cuomo, have received exceptionally high marks. 

According to a Siena poll posted on March 30th with data collected 3/22 - 3/26, approval of Cuomo’s pandemic response is 87-11, including 70% approval from Republicans! DeBlasio’s is lower, but still quite good at 61-31 approval to disapproval. 



The above figures are specifically about how well they've done to address the pandemic, but Cuomo’s overall approval has also improved by 54 points to a near record high of 71-23. 



https://scri.siena.edu/2020/03/30/87-of-nyers-approve-of-cuomos-handling-of-the-coronavirus/



The Hill is also reporting on a national poll conducted by Harvard CAPS/Harris from March 24th - March 26th which shows Cuomo with a national approval rating of 45%, nearly as high as Trump with 48%. Annoyingly, I can't find that actual data anywhere, so we just have to go off the quotes they provide:


  Forty-five percent of Americans say they have a favorable view of how New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) is responding to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new Harvard CAPS/Harris poll released exclusively to The Hill.
  
  Harvard CAPS/Harris polling director Mark Penn told The Hill. ""No question he is seen now as a leader at least with Democrats and not seen as partisan since he is favorable right now by 2 to 1.""
  
  Cuomo favorability in US hits 45 percent: poll


If we take Penn at is word, that would mean that his approval is 45%, disapproval is ~ 22% and no opinion is 33%. While 45% doesn't sound that high, I'd argue that it's surprising for that many people nationwide to have a positive opinion of a local politician from another state.
"
"Both countries have declared a lockdown. So what went wrong in the USA? 

Why has COVID-19 affected less people in India that in the USA?
","India is not testing much. You can go here and play around with testing relative to the population of some countries. While the US has already a relatively low testing rate given with 25 daily tests per million people, the number of India is even smaller. If you don't test, you can't count infected people


"
"The background is obvious. I'm really curious about the wording. In particular, UK told that staying home this weekend is 'not a request'. To me, it sounds like loosening restriction, in an unofficial way. I don't follow British politics that much so forgive me if I'm missing the obvious. What's the deal here?
","I'm not venturing a speculation here (yet) whether that was a loosening (of the language) or not relative to prior communications on this matter, but the fuller context of that recent statement is:


  Mr Hancock - who recently ended his seven days of self-isolation after contracting the virus - said: ""We cannot relax our discipline now. If we do, people will die.
  
  ""I end with the advice we all know. This advice is not a request - it is an instruction.
  
  ""Stay at home, protect lives and then you will be doing your part.""
  
  [BBC subheading:] 'Stay at home for nurses'
  
  Ms May also appealed to the public to stay at home, saying: ""This weekend is going to be very warm and it will be very tempting to go out and enjoy those summer rays.
  
  ""But please, I ask to remember Aimee and Areema. Please stay at home for them.""


Aimee and Areema are two (young) nurses who recently died after contracting the new coronavirus.

The Evening Standard has chosen to headline that announcement as 


  Matt Hancock orders Brits not to break coronavirus lockdown during weekend heatwave: If we relax our discipline people will die


The Telegraph headlined their youtube video of that press conference with 


  ‘Good weather no excuse to break coronavirus social distancing rules’, says Matt Hancock


So a reasonable-enough interpretation seems to be that it's not a relaxation of the prior government stance. I don't know if some left-wing press has tried to spin this into something else. I've searched a bit but couldn't find such attempts/articles, so ""it's probably just you[r interpretation]"".
"
"In Europe, such comparisons have been published based on data by Google, so I suspect it might available for the US too. E.g.


  An analysis here of smartphone location data by the U.S. search engine giant showed that visits to shops, parks or railway stations fell steeply in most European countries between Feb. 16 and March 29 as governments sought to slow the explosive spread of the COVID-19 disease.
  
  In Italy and Spain, which have imposed near-total lockdowns on public life, retail and recreational trips were down by 94%. The two Mediterranean countries, along with France, saw the sharpest drops in people passing through transportation hubs like railway or metro stations. Visits to workplaces were down by more than 60% in Italy and Spain, in an indication that their lockdowns may turn out to be the most economically disruptive.
  
  To the north, Sweden has by contrast sought to minimise disruption to social and economic life while its caseload remains low. Visits to restaurants, shopping centres and cinemas, for example, have declined by just 24%. Numbers going to grocery markets and pharmacies have fallen by 10%, while trips to the park are actually up by 43% as people head out to enjoy the Scandinavian spring. Going out for a walk or a jog is up in Denmark, Estonia and Finland too.
  
  The number of people spending more time in residential areas is up by 5% in Sweden, whereas in Italy and Spain it has increased by 24% and 22% respectively as people are confined to their homes.
  
  In Britain, which moved relatively late to restrict people-to-people contacts, the impact has been less severe than in southern Europe. Retail and recreation visits are down by 85%, public transport by 75% and time spent in workplaces by 55%.
  
  Germany, which has the third-highest caseload but a relatively low number of fatalities thanks to widespread early testing for COVID-19, has taken a less radical approach with the number of people visiting workplaces down by 39%, the data show.


Are there such (comparative) statistics available for US states? E.g. did these numbers fall in NY (which was hardest hit by the pandemic) more than elsewhere in the US?
","Yes, Google has published these statistics at a per-state level for the United States. 

To use the example in your question of New York, compared with a state with far fewer COVID-19 cases currently, such as West Virginia, we can see that New York has seen large reductions in mobility trends across every category except Residential, while West Virginia has relatively smaller reductions, and in fact a large increase in mobility trends for parks. 

This seems to be similar across the board, with the statistics for Nebraska, with a similar number of cases as West Virginia also showing smaller reductions in most categories, a smaller increase in Residential mobility trends, and a whopping 109% increase in mobility trends to parks. New Jersey, however, another state which has been fairly badly hit, sees a large reduction in the statistics across the board.

At a first glance, then, this would seem to support your theory that these numbers fell more significantly within states that have been hardest hit by the pandemic so far, meaning that social distancing measures are being complied with and taken more seriously in these states. Further analysis would need to be performed on the full data set, including the range of social distancing regulations and enforcement levels in the individual states in order to draw full conclusions.

Google themselves state in their reports that ""Location accuracy and the understanding of categorized places varies from region to region, so we don’t recommend using this data to compare changes between countries, or between regions with different characteristics (e.g. rural versus urban areas).""
"
"According to a NY Post article, parks in New York have become so overcrowded during this Covid-19 outbreak (supposedly because residents can't find anywhere else to go, e.g. restaurants are closed), so much so that some use cemeteries as parks in the hope of finding a less crowded spot. How accurate are these journalistic impressions? Is there data on the increase in overcrowding in NY parks during this outbreak, and if so, have there been any public health estimates on the danger that these park crowds may cause?

(I see that Cuomo was incensed by the crowded parks, but that was more than a week ago. He did close playgrounds, in the meantime.)

To those who think this can't be but BS (per comments below), governor Cuomo and mayor de Blasio have disagreed often enough, e.g. The Atlantic relates their disagreement on school closures:


  De Blasio angered New York parents and some of his own allies by resisting for days a decision to close schools, acting only following pressure from Cuomo and after a near-revolt by advisers and top public-health officials. “He’s both a bad decision maker and not good at communicating about it,” said an elected New York Democrat and former ally of the mayor’s, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve a working relationship with the de Blasio administration.


So I wouldn't be surprised they disagreed about parks too. The question whether the parks are crowded obviously has a public-health and thus a political dimension too nowadays (so I disagree with those who think this is off topic.)

And if you need anther source, the March 23 story was covered by Bloomberg too, with a March 20 image:




  Tired of being cooped up at home, hordes of New Yorkers headed to Central Park and other open spaces in the city over the weekend -- and that’s making Governor Andrew Cuomo very irritated.
  
  “It’s insensitive, it’s arrogant, it’s self-destructive, it’s disrespectful to other people, and it has to stop, and it has to stop now,” he said. “This is not a joke, and I am not kidding.”
  
  Calling the crowds “wholly inappropriate” amid a statewide stay-home order, he’s now asking the city to develop a plan that he can approve Monday to correct that.
  
  “We talk about social distancing,” he said. “I was in these parks, and you would not know that anything was going on.”


I don't know how [un]reliable ""The Gothamist"" is, but they posted these images supposedly from March 27:




Of course, a lot can change in a couple of weeks in people's attitudes, even if the parks are still open. And likewise some photos may be unrepresentative. The question is: did any behavioral change happen that made the closures unnecessary, or was Cuomo ranting like a madman and there was no problem to begin with? 
","I don't know about NYC, I live in NC. Since our state and county governments began issuing stay at home orders, I've noticed an incredible number of people gathered in our parks - far more than what I'd see on a typical day.

The entrances to our state parks were closed, but access to lakes is still available for boats. It hasn't been uncommon to drive by a lake access point and see hundreds of people tightly gathered by the loading ramps. Trail-heads which on a great day would have 1 or 2 cars parked now have as many as 20 or 30. And I've never seen church parking lots so packed.

So, if NYC is anything like where I live, it wouldn't be at all surprising to find community parks jammed.

From what we hear on a daily basis, we need to stay home except for essential requirements. We need to stay at least 6 feet from anyone not in our immediate family (as in those living under the same roof). And even more recently, we need to be wearing masks when out in public. We shouldn't be hanging out with groups of more than 10 people (and that's not so much for viral safety, that's for social sanity). And like any virus, it makes no difference if it's passed indoors or out. The chance of infection remains the same either way.

"I didn't follow the UK news closely, so please enlighten me on how cabinet meetings were conducted by Boris Johnson while he has COVID-19. All I've read on this is that:


  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been admitted to hospital for tests, 10 days after testing positive for coronavirus, Downing Street has said.
  
  He was taken to a London hospital on Sunday evening with ""persistent symptoms"" - including a temperature.
  
  It is said to be a ""precautionary step"" taken on the advice of his doctor.
  
  The prime minister remains in charge of the government, but the foreign secretary is expected to chair a coronavirus meeting on Monday morning. [...]
  
  Mr Johnson has worked from home since it was announced that he had tested positive for coronavirus on 27 March.


So did BoJo chair the prior meetings via videconferencing, but this is no longer possible from a hospital setting (as opposed to his home)?
","The Prime Minister has been chairing meetings via videoconference, specifically using Zoom (BBC News).

It is being reported this evening (by ITV News among others) that tomorrow's COVID-19 meeting will be chaired by Dominic Raab, the First Secretary of State.

"In the Queen's address to the Commonwealth on the Corona Virus, she says at 1:15:

""The pride in who we are is not a part of our past. It defines our present and our future.""
What does the Queen mean by this? Is she saying that Britain does not have a past it can be proud of?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2klmuggOElE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=115
","The queen is saying that the pride of the British people, is not merely pride over past behavior, but is pride in themselves as they are now and as they move forward. She is not denying that the British should be proud of their past; she is suggesting that their past is not what defines their pride. Their pride is defined by who they are.
"
"Somewhat controversially, China has had temporarily relocated those infected with Covid-19 in the Wuhan area to so-called Fangcang hospitals, large communal areas transformed into make-shift hospitals. Although there were up to 13 Fangcang hospitals opened at one point in Wuhan, these were apparently all closed by March 10.


  Fangcang shelter hospitals may seem similar to the makeshift and emergency field hospitals used during previous epidemics in other countries, for example, in the USA during the 1918–19 influenza pandemic, or in African countries during the 2014–15 Ebola epidemic. However, they differ in several important ways. First, the Fangcang shelter hospitals in China were established to isolate the patients who were most likely to transmit the infection because they had only mild to moderate COVID-19 and were thus likely to be active in their daily lives and in contact with family and community members. Second, the Fangcang shelter hospitals served an important triage function, separating patients by severity of symptoms, which was not a focus of previous makeshift and emergency field hospitals. [...]


These Fangcang hospitals should not be confused with the other kind of emergency hospitals that China had built earlier, for those more seriously sick with Covid-19, such as the Huoshenshan Hospital. (The latter was a prefab hospital with separate rooms.)

I've heard that some countries are already considering converting open-space structures to some kind of emergency/extra hospitals, e.g. as seen in this US footage. While the open-space conversion resembles more a Fangcang than the other type of prefab Chinese hospital, what do know about plans to mass-quarantine the mild cases in such open-space-conversion hospitals elsewhere, i.e. do (any of) these resemble Fangcangs in (intended) function, not just in looks?
","Yes, several countries are planning to implement this approach, and in some cases, already have. On March 12th, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), an EU agency, updated its rapid risk assessment on the COVID-19 pandemic, in which it advises states to 


  designate treatment facilities both for mild and for severe COVID-19 cases with critical care capabilities (e.g. ECMO). This
  implies activation of hospital plans to the highest level to be able to cancel elective diagnostic and operative procedures and
  re-assign human resources, creating temporary treatment facilities for the mild cases or advising self-isolation until
  symptoms improve or worsen.


The WHO also released guidance to this effect on March 17th, reiterating that 


  WHO recommends that all laboratory confirmed cases be isolated and
  cared for in a health care facility.
  
  [...]
  
  If all mild cases cannot be isolated in health facilities, then those
  with mild illness and no risk factors may need to be isolated in
  non-traditional facilities, such as repurposed hotels, stadiums or
  gymnasiums where they can remain until their symptoms resolve and
  laboratory tests for COVID-19 virus are negative.


In Madrid, this advice was implemented with a temporary hospital set up in the IFEMA conference centre. The first patients arrived at the facility on March 21st, and initially had a capacity for 200 patients with 'mild' cases of COVID-19. Capacity will eventually be extended to 1300 beds, with a small number of ICU units in case these mild cases progress to severe cases.

Hotel Vía Castellana has also been converted (article in Spanish) to a temporary hospital for mild cases, with six of the hospital's floors converted to facilities for the lightly ill, and a seventh converted to house medical staff.

In South Korea, this strategy has also been used - the WSJ reports that in order to solve the issue of hospital overcrowding:


  South Korea divided confirmed patients into four categories. Only the
  sickest and elderly went to hospitals. The young and asymptomatic went
  to dormitories, which were lent by Samsung Life Insurance Co., LG
  Display Co. and others, equipped with little more than beds, Wi-Fi and
  the occasional television.
  
  The decision ensured that low-risk individuals remained quarantined
  under government watch. Thousands of South Korea’s virus patients have
  ridden out the past several weeks living in buildings where companies
  typically put up workers for off-site, multiday training.


In the Phillipines, ""Emergency Quarantine Facilities"" (EQFs) are being planned, temporary centres designed for ""patients who are waiting for test results or have mild symptoms but aren’t in dire straits — a way to keep potentially infected people separate from their communities.""

Many countries, however, have chosen not to adopt this strategy, instead advising those with mild to moderate symptoms to self-isolate, prioritising hospital beds, including field hospital beds, for those most at risk or with the worst symptoms. In Singapore, the country had enough hospital capacity to deal with all patients, including those with mild symptoms, due in part to the amount of testing and contact tracing which was used to isolate and quarantine cases.

"After last minute, party-line decisions by the US and Wisconsin Supreme Courts, Wisconsin will hold their presidential primary and a hotly-contested Supreme Court election tomorrow (April 7th) despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The state's Democratic governor has been pushing to delay the election and/or extend the window for absentee ballot collection, but the Republican controlled legislature have opposed both moves. 

In addition to the the potential for voters to get infected while voting, the vast majority of polling sites have been closed due to a lack of volunteers (most of whom are usually retirees) to run them:


  The state has faced serious questions about its ability to run an election amid the pandemic. With poll workers quitting out of fears of contracting the virus, more than 100 municipalities have said they lack enough staff to run even one polling place.
  
  Milwaukee typically has about 180 sites; this election the city plans to have five open. The head of the state elections commission raised the possibility in court testimony that some voters may have to head to a different town on Election Day because no one will be staffing the polls in their hometowns.
  
  Wisconsin Is Set to Vote on Tuesday After Court Overrules Governor’s Postponement - The New York Times


Why is the state Republican party insisting on going forward with an election where most people will be unable to vote, even if they're willing to risk their lives and health to do so? Even if they don't consider the threat of COVID-19 to be significant, the closure of so many polling places guarantees that people will be denied the opportunity to vote.
","Rural voters aren't afraid to go to the polls to keep a conservative state supreme court justice in power.

The April 2020 ballot does include the U.S. presidential primary, but that will have little effect on state politics.  After I first posted this answer, the New York Times echoed many of the points I make below, starting with:


  Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders are on the ballot in Wisconsin, but the main event is the State Supreme Court race between the conservative incumbent justice, Daniel Kelly, and a liberal challenger, Jill Karofsky.


Wisconsin has an elected state supreme court that currently has 5 conservatives and 2 liberals.  One of the conservatives (Daniel Kelly) is up for election in April 2020, and the another conservative is up in the next election after that (Pat Rogensack, 2023).  If liberals win both of those seats back, they would have a 4-3 majority and could undo the laws that keep the minority Republican party in power.


  The election determined the size of the court's conservative majority. A win for Karofsky would have reduced the conservative majority to 4-3, meaning that the next regularly scheduled election in 2023 would decide control of the court. A Kelly win would have preserved the court's 5-2 conservative majority.
  
  Ballotpedia


It's helpful to understand the political context:


For decades prior to 2010, Wisconsin was a moderate state.  The legislature and governorship each frequently flipped between the Democratic and Republican parties.  Since 1900, Wisconsin has equally chosen Republicans and Democrats for President.
Justices on the state supreme court are elected and technically nonpartisan.  Nonetheless, their conservative versus liberal ideology are often clear.  For decades prior to 2010, the state supreme court held a liberal majority.
It's worth mentioning that long ago, Wisconsin Republicans were leaders in open elections and progressive ideas.  The Republican party started in Wisconsin, as an anti-slavery party (later to be re-started in Michigan).  The word ""progressive"" was coined by Republican Robert La Follette.  Wisconsin was the first or among the first states to adopt women's suffrage, open ballots, primary elections, recall elections, referenda, outlawing child labor, worker's compensation, and income taxes; all were progressive Republican measures.  Prior to the Tea Party, the state was considered one of the most bipartisan and least corrupt states.
Led primarily by Tea Party candidates, in the fall 2010 election, Wisconsin Republicans won control of all three branches of government.  This included the election of Scott Walker as governor, a one-seat majority in the state senate, a considerable margin in the state assembly, and a 4 to 3 majority in the state supreme court.
Republicans quickly enacted a series of laws that would lock in their party's control:


Using sophisticated computer models to draw election maps for the U.S. House, state senate, and state assembly to maximize Republican seats and to pack Democratic votes into few districts.  The gerrymandering is so successful that in the 2018 elections, Republicans won 5 of 8 U.S. House seats with only 45.61% of votes, and 63 of 99 state assembly seats with only 44.75% of votes.
Adopting a voter-ID law.  Minorities and the poor -- who tend to vote for Democrats -- are less likely to have the proper types of identification.
Purged 234,000 voters from voting rolls.
Requiring early voting to be performed only at the municipal clerk's office, and not multiple sites.  Thus the 600,000 residents of Milwaukee (a Democratic stronghold) had only one site for early voting, the same as a town of 600 people would.  This law was struck down by a federal judge in 2016.


  
  A requirement that cities can have only one place for early voting. Critics have said large cities such as Milwaukee should be able to have multiple voting sites because not everyone can get downtown easily.
  

Limiting the days and hours for early and absentee voting.
Replacing the agency which oversees elections, from the Government Accountability Board composed of judges chosen by other judges, to the Wisconsin Election Commission chosen by politicians.
Moving the state supreme court elections from the fall (which have high Democratic turnout) to the spring (which have poor Democratic turnout).  This has been particularly effective at increasing the conservative control of the court, from 3-4 in 2010 to 7-2 in 2020.  Note how the election during the pandemic is a spring election, with a supreme court contest.
Holding special elections to fill vacancies on unusual dates -- when Republicans turn out -- instead of the usual fall and spring election dates when Democrats turn out.
After a series of failed recall elections for the governor and Republicans in the state senate, changes that made recalls more difficult (2015 Act 117).
A series of laws (most famously 2011 Act 10) to cripple the power and finances of labor unions, which are the primary backers of Democratic candidates.
In 2015, changing the Chief Justice position from the most senior justice (a liberal) to being chosen by a majority of the court (conservatives).
In 2015, stripping the powers of the Democratic secretary of state.
Increasing the powers of the Republican governor and attorney general.  When Democrats won back these offices in 2018, the powers of those offices were reduced in a lame duck session.

The conservatives controlling the state supreme court have upheld most of the laws described above.  This includes laws that affected the justices' own re-election.  In particular, the decision specifically about whether to continue the election during the pandemic went along ideological lines.
Moderate Republicans were treated poorly by the dominant Tea Party faction.  The previous Republican leaders of the legislature -- Dave Schultz in the assembly and Mike Ellis in the senate -- were pushed out of leadership by Tea Party leaders.  Schultz would later testify in a gerrymandering case that Republicans were brought one-by-one to a law office, and were ordered to vote for the gerrymandered maps, else their own districts would be gerrymandered to make them lose.  In the ensuing years, many moderate Republicans quit the party in disgust, and many moderate office-holders were voted out in primaries by Tea Party candidates.  The loss of moderates had drained the support of the Republican party.
Since 2010, Democrats have been gaining ground.  By number of voters statewide, the Republican party is actually a minority party in Wisconsin.  Wisconsin's top Republican even admitted that they aren't the majority:


  After the Republican Robin Vos, the speaker of the Wisconsin Statehouse, said that “if you took Madison and Milwaukee out of the state election formula, we would have a clear majority.""


However, the measures described above are so effective that the state supreme court and both houses of the state legislature still remain in Republican control.
Democrats swept every statewide office in 2018: U.S. Senate, governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, and treasurer.  They had more votes in the U.S. House, but because of gerrymandering, they won only 3 of 8 seats.  They also had more votes in the state assembly and gained one seat, but again because of gerrymandering, they did not gain control.
As has happened nationwide, the Wisconsin Republican party has aligned with rural interests and and the Democratic party with urban interests.  COVID-19 is likely to keep people in high-density (i.e. Democratic) districts at home.  Like other rural places in the U.S., rural Wisconsinites believe that COVID-19 is a ""big city"" phenomenon and are likely to show up to the polls.  Per the New York Times, about one of the least populous counties:


  Bruce Johnson, the Democratic chairman in Pepin County, along the state’s western border with Minnesota, said he pushed for absentee balloting but people were less concerned because they rarely wait in lines to vote.


Wikipedia:


  When the election went ahead on 7 April, access to easy in-person voting heavily depended on where voters were located. In smaller or more rural communities, which tend to be whiter and vote Republican, few issues were reported.


It's therefore in the interest of Republicans to keep the election going during the pandemic.
Should liberals take back the state supreme court, they can overturn the system of laws which keeps the Republican party in power.  They would then be at the mercy of the voters, who have been increasingly voting Democratic.

"Sweden has adopted a far less radical set of policies in reaction to COVID-19 than most other European states. Many other European states are in ""lock-down"", with severe restrictions on people's free movement, with people being advised to only leave their homes for food/medicine. In Sweden, by contrast, people are largely carrying on with their normal lives.


  While every other country in Europe has been ordered into ever more stringent coronavirus lockdown, Sweden has remained the exception. Schools for pupils up to 16 years, kindergartens, bars, restaurants, ski resorts, sports clubs, hairdressers: all remain open, weeks after everything closed down in next door Denmark and Norway.
  
  As the rest of Europe lives under lockdown, Sweden keeps calm and carries on - The Guardian, March 28, 2020


What social and political factors underlie this decision, and why is it so dramatically different to other European countries response?
","The reason for Sweden's rather hands-off approach compared to other European countries was summed up rather well by lead epidemiologist of the Public Health Agency of Sweden, Anders Tegnell, who said in an interview with CNBC:


  My view is that basically all European countries are trying to do the
  same thing — we’re trying to slow down the spread as much as possible
  to keep healthcare and society working ... and we have shown some
  different methods to slow down the spread, [...] Sweden has gone
  mostly for voluntary measures because that’s how we’re used to
  working, and we have a long tradition that it works rather well.


This tradition of 'laissez-faire-ism' that Tegnell talks about was explored by Johan Norberg in his 2013 essay How Laissez-Faire Made Sweden Rich. This is quite long but well worth a read. Notably, Norberg argues that rather than Sweden's economic and social successes being a result of the SAP ""managing to tax, spend, and regulate Sweden into a more equitable distribution of wealth—without hurting its productive capacity"", Sweden's greatest successes both economically and socially ""took place when Sweden had a laissez-faire economy"".

Sweden's approach to the current pandemic, then, would seem to be influenced by the political traditions of its past. I should note that although Tegnell is hopeful that the current strategy will be successful, he doesn't rule out the implementation of more stringent measures should the data suggest that the laissez-faire tactics are not working.

As far as social factors that have influenced Sweden's response go, one such factor is how sparsely spread its population is. This article from Our World in Data notes how Sweden consistently ranks near the top of metrics related to single-occupant households, and the country also ranks 50th out of 54th for Population Density amongst other European countries.

It is likely that another factor has been the reluctance of the government to negatively affect the economy more than is required. For example, although taking a hands-off approach with regard to restricting personal liberties, it has taken a far more active role in ensuring the continued functioning of business, and on March 27th announced that it will guarantee 70% of bank loans provided to companies that are experiencing financial difficulty as a result of the pandemic.

In conclusion, Sweden's response so far seems to be a combination of the reluctance of Swedes to accept restrictions on personal liberty - note the outcry by opposition parties when a proposal to rule by decree was announced, a tradition of past laissez-faire approaches, and distinct social factors that will potentially help provide a natural defence against the virus.

"I was looking at H.R.748 - CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act on the Congress website. I was surprised to find that the bill originally passed the House on July 17, 2019. I found this strange because the Coronavirus was not known until the last few months of 2019.

I looked at the original bill from the house. It is fairly short and has nothing to do with Coronavirus, but instead talks about removing a specific tax related to healthcare.

I took a looked at the Senate amendment to the bill. It says, ""Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:"" This is followed the very lengthy text of the CARES Act. It does not contain any text related to the original purpose of the bill.

Why did the Senate use this bill instead of creating a new one? What happened to the original? Since the Senate replaced it's text, can it no longer fulfill it's original purpose?
","The reason for amending this bill instead of the Senate creating a new bill was to fulfil the requirements of Article I, Section 7, Clause 1 of the Constitution, also known as the Origination or Revenue clause, which states that all bills for raising revenue must originate within the House of Representatives. Note that despite the Senate seemingly being able to dictate the content of the bill, the House still has to approve the amendment.

The Senate has decided that it is legitimate to fulfil the letter of this clause, if arguably not the spirit, by replacing the entire text of a bill originating in the House with a bill for raising revenue. The constitutionality of this decision has been examined by Rebecca M. Kysar in her 2013 paper The 'Shell Bill' Game: Avoidance and The Origination Clause. In Chapter II, subsection C2, she notes that while the Supreme Court has never ruled on this, several state courts and lower federal courts have condoned this interpretation.

The original bill is now one and the same as the CARES Act, and you are correct in saying that it can no longer fill its original purpose, as the original wording has been completely removed and replaced by the Senate amendment.

"Given that a vaccine or an effective treatment for COVID-19 is the best way out of the current crisis, it seems logical that governments would take a ""no holds barred"" approach to making it happen as soon as possible. Have any countries so far announced that they would abolish (or significantly relax) restrictions on drug/vaccine development for the duration of the pandemic?
","China has also fast-tracked their own vaccine development, with testing in humans (news of March 18):


  CanSino Bio and its collaborators at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences’ Institute of Biotechnology secured a quick Chinese regulatory go-ahead to start human testing of their recombinant coronavirus vaccine, the company said in a disclosure (PDF) to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Wednesday. [...]
  
  The green light was doled out very quickly. It was only Tuesday when CanSino said it had filed the pre-IND review application for the vaccine to authorities and was in the process of a rolling submission of technical documents. [...]
  
  Meanwhile, amid growing numbers of infections in the U.S., the FDA has allowed a phase 1 study of Moderna’s mRNA vaccine without animal data. On Monday, the biotech said researchers at the National Institutes of Health dosed the first subject. [...]
  
  Besides CanSino and Moderna, many other companies are also working on vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. [...]


I cannot tell you how much ""bending of the rules"" this is in China, since I'm not familiar with their regulations.  But the timing of the Chinese announcement was roughly two days later after the US announced the first Moderna vaccine dose having been injected into a human (on March 16). Interestingly perhaps, China is also developing a mRNA vaccine ""jointly developed by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Tongji University and Stermina in Shanghai"", but this one is still undergoing animal testing in China, with human testing announced to begin mid-April.

So yeah, the US (NIAID/Moderna) and China (CanSino) are now basically in a ""race for the [vaccine] cure"". Others will probably join. I suspect they might also benefit from regulatory fast-tracks, possibly depending how well politically connected they are in their test jurisdictions. (The EU has given Curevac a grant to work on a mRNA vaccine similar to the Moderna one; however no human tests have begun with that--they've been announced for June. The WHO said that over 40 concrete vaccine candidates have been proposed, with at least a hundred in development.)

The WSJ reported (without a lot of specifics on the regulatory side that):


  Counting drugs approved for other diseases, there are 254 clinical trials testing treatments or vaccines for the virus, many spearheaded by universities and government research agencies, with hundreds more trials planned. Researchers have squeezed timelines that usually total months into weeks or even days.

"
"From (answers to) a related question, the WHO had mostly changed their public stance on the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 after Jan 22, while giving mostly ""negative signals"" on this matter of human-to-human transmission before Jan 22.

Interestingly, on Jan 17, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) put out a rapid report saying that: 


  The occurrence of a few cases having no history of contact with the implicated market
  or other any similar market suggests the possibility of the infection source being more widely distributed, or of human-to-human transmission similar to other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The occurrence of a few family clusters also supports this latter hypothesis. However, there is currently no knowledge on the transmission mode or risk factors for transmission. Furthermore, there is no information on the disease spectrum or risk factors for severity. In light of these unknowns, we cannot exclude the possibility of low-level virus circulation in the Wuhan community and thus the possibility of other clusters occurring in the near future. [...]
  
  
  There is a high likelihood of case importation in countries with the greatest volume of people travelling to and from Wuhan (i.e. countries in Asia).
  There is a low likelihood of importation of cases in EU/EEA countries, due to the less extensive traffic of people with Wuhan. 
  


For comparison, what did the US CDC say on this matter (human-to-human transmission) within this period (i.e between Jan 14 and 21), and did they also asses back then (like the ECDC did) the likelihood of importation into the US?



Insofar I was able to find, by Jan 31, the US CDC was clearly convinced of human-to-human transmission:


  On January 31, 2020, CDC published updated PUI guidance (8) in response to the evolving global epidemiology of 2019-nCoV, including the rapid geographic expansion and documentation of person-to-person transmission (9). Updated guidance emphasizes 2019-nCoV testing for symptomatic persons in close contact with patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, persons returning from Hubei province in addition to Wuhan City, and persons from mainland China requiring hospitalization because of fever and lower respiratory tract illness. Additional refinements to this approach likely will be needed in the future as understanding of 2019-nCoV epidemiology continues to improve.


But what did they say roughly two weeks earlier, before the WHO had confirmed human-to-human transmission?
","On January 17th, the CDC announced that COVID-19 screening would begin at ""three U.S. airports that receive most of the travelers from Wuhan, China: San Francisco (SFO), New York (JFK), and Los Angeles (LAX) airports.""

They also state in this press release that:


  CDC is actively monitoring this situation for pertinent information
  about the source of outbreak, and risk for further spread through
  person-to-person or animal-to-person transmission. CDC may adjust
  screening procedures and other response activities as this outbreak
  investigation continues and more is learned about the newly emerging
  virus. Entry screening alone is not a guarantee against the possible
  importation of this new virus but is an important public health tool
  during periods of uncertainty and part of a multilayered government
  response strategy. As new information emerges, CDC will reassess entry
  screening measures and could scale activities up or down accordingly.


This indicates that an assessment of the likelihood of importation of the virus into the US was completed, and a decision was made that only the airports with the largest amount of traffic needed to be screened. They do however note that this is not a guarantee that the virus will not be imported. Further on in the briefing, they mention that:


  China health officials report that most of the patients infected with
  2019-nCoV have had exposure to a large market where live animals were
  present, suggesting this is a novel virus that has jumped the species
  barrier to infect people. Chinese authorities additionally report that
  several hundred health care workers caring for outbreak patients are
  being monitored and no spread of this virus from patients to health
  care workers has been seen. They report no sustained spread of this
  virus in the community, however there are indications that some
  limited person-to-person spread may have occurred. CDC is responding
  to this outbreak out of an abundance of caution, ready to detect
  people infected with 2019-CoV.


This briefing suggests that while the CDC was preparing for human-to-human transmission to be confirmed, and may have even thought that this was likely, it did not have the data to confirm this.

Later on, on the 21st, the CDC released another briefing after the first COVID-19 positive patient was identified in the US. The briefing notes that the patient returned from China on the 15th, before the screening mentioned above was implemented. This release, however also does not state that human-to-human transmission is confirmed, but mentions that


  While originally thought to be spreading from animal-to-person, there
  are growing indications that limited person-to-person spread is
  happening. It’s unclear how easily this virus is spreading between
  people.


At this point the CDC also implemented screening at two more airports, Atlanta and Chicago.

It seems clear, therefore, that the CDC did not have access to data which confirmed human-to-human transmission, although the steps taken to implement health screening at airports, and the advice given to healthcare providers on January 8th indicates that it certainly thought that the likelihood of this was great. Clearly the health screening also proves that spread from Wuhan was seen as a possibility, although we can infer from the fact that this was initially only set up at three airports that this was either not seen as a large possibility, or that the spread via air-travel was not expected to be high enough to warrant a complete lock-down.

"Even Donald Trump has praised India on providing the drug Hydroxychloroquine. How has India become the primary source for the drug? 
","India is a large producer of Hydroxychloroquine because, prior to the promotion of the drug as a potential treatment for COVID-19, its most widespread use was as an anti-malarial drug. India has, according to the WHO's World malaria report 2019, the largest proportion of malaria cases outside of Africa:


  Nineteen countries in sub-Saharan Africa and India carried almost
  85% of the global malaria burden.


The report also notes that India is the only one of the ""high burden to high impact"" countries (basically countries most affected by malaria) to have significant domestic investment into dealing with the disease compared to the reliance on international aid. This has manifested itself in the form of pharmaceutical manufacturers which can supply India with its domestic demand for the drug, such as Zydus Cadila and Ipca Laboratories.

This Forbes article notes that these companies in particular have significant capacity to ramp up production:


  “The priority is to manufacture this drug versus anything else,” says
  Sharvil Patel, managing director at Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila,
  which had $1.9 billion in revenues in fiscal 2019. “We have ramped up
  our production of hydroxychloroquine from 3 metric tons per month to
  20 to 30 metric tons per month and can scale it up further to 40 to 50
  metric tons if there is a requirement.”
  
  Ipca Labs, which has 20-metric-ton capacity, can produce 100 million
  tablets a month. “The Indian government has placed a significant
  order,” says Ajit Kumar Jain, joint managing director of Ipca Labs.
  “We can increase our manufacturing capacity to 26 metric tons in a
  month or two. We are also simultaneously ramping up our packing and
  labelling lines.”
  
  [...]
  
  Sudarshan Jain, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical
  Alliance, an industry group, says that “the domestic demand is 3
  million tablets a month but we have the capacity to go up to 150
  million to 200 million tablets a month easily.” He adds that “it is
  very difficult to predict demand going forward because we do not know
  how many will be affected.”


This is, of course, on top of the underlying fact that India is, according to Raconteur, the largest provider of generic drugs globally, with its pharmaceutical industry is growing by 7 to 8 per cent a year, with growth of 11 to 13 percent expected in 2020.

It seems that India's prominence in the manufacture of the drug is due to existing infrastructure due to high existing domestic demand, and a strong underlying pharmaceutical industry, giving it the ability to quickly scale up production levels.

"I was reading this article on the Culture Secretary calling for Ofcom to take action against the London Live TV station. Yesterday, April 8th, the station broadcast an interview with David Icke, the same conspiracy theorist who claimed that a link between 5G and the COVID-19 pandemic exists in a live broadcast on Youtube which caused Youtube to alter its policies on removing COVID-19 misinformation. 

In this latest broadcast, Icke reportedly accused Israel of ""using coronavirus to test its technology"". The Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, said:


  You are absolutely right these are lunatic conspiracy theories and no
  sensible person would give them a moment's thought. Clearly that
  station is regulated by Ofcom and I would be expecting Ofcom to take
  appropriate action. Clearly they're independent (Ofcom), but I will be
  in touch with them to understand what action they are taking in
  respect to that.


The article also gives the example of a 'sanction' by Ofcom:


  And a community radio station was sanctioned by Ofcom last month after
  it broadcast conspiracy theories about coronavirus.
  
  Uckfield FM was forced to apologise after a programme featured a guest
  presented to listeners as a health professional, but who made claims
  Covid-19 was linked to the rollout of 5G.


Being forced to apologise doesn't seem like that harsh a punishment personally, and with a quick search, I couldn't see whether Ofcom has any sanction powers beyond this. What powers does Ofcom have to impose sanctions, and what form can these sanctions take?
","Ofcom's powers with regard to wireless telegraphy (i.e. radio) and television broadcasts and broadcasters are provided for by the Broadcasting Acts and the Communications Act 2003.

Ofcom can issue a warning, direction or fine, suspend or restrict the broadcaster's activities, revoke the broadcaster's licence or bring criminal proceedings. 

Directions may include ""broadcast an apology / correction / statement"".

Generally the maximum fine for commercial radio is £250,000 or 5% the broadcaster's 'qualifying revenue', whichever is the greater. There is a settlement process providing for discounts.

Revocation of the licence would make it unlawful for the broadcaster to broadcast in the UK.

Ofcom's current penalty guidelines at the time of writing can be found in this PDF and its procedures for investigating alleged breaches of content standards can be found in this PDF. They are changed from time to time - both kinds of documents can be downloaded via Ofcom's Policies and Guidelines page.

Ofcom purports to want to avoid disproportionately infringing on freedom of expression, and to discourage bad behaviour and encourage good behaviour. Hence the outcome of this case, instead of something worse.

For the case to which you refer, you can read Ofcom's reasoning in this PDF found via the bulletins section of Ofcom's website.

"On Mar 12 2020, US Federal Reserve injected ""$1.5T of liquidity into the markets, rather than that amount of money"".
 On Mar 18, CARES Act came into force and  will pay out $2 trillion USD.
On Apr  8  the Federal Reserve released minutes from meeting where it took rates to zero because of coronavirus


  Miller said he expects the Fed balance sheet, currently just shy of $6 trillion, to expand to $10 trillion or more.


On Apr 9, the Federal Reserve will print $2.3 trillion USD to buy junk bonds and lend to states in a new wave of stimulus.

My questions


Why did Congress need the CARES Act? Why didn't it just recommend that the Federal Reserve spend $2T USD, which looks  way easier? I know that the Federal Reserve is autonomous and Congress can't order the Federal Reserve to do anything.
Similarly, Senate Democrats block $250 billion in small business relief, accuse McConnell of a ""political stunt"" : politics. Why didn't Congress Members just recommend the Fed spend another $250B,?
As you can see from the points above, both sides criticized and haggled before enacting the CARES Act. But the Federal Reserve has spent way more than $2.250T! Isn't this a contradiction? Why haven't Congress Members criticized or haggled the Federal Reserve like Democrats and Republicans are criticizing each other in Congress? 
Doesn't the CARES Act prove that the Fed isn't spending, or hasn't spent, enough money on the the right people?  If the Fed was giving money to the right people, then would the US need the CARES Act? 

","Broadly speaking, the Fed can only keep markets liquid by doing things like buying assets or making loans to banks against assets owned by the banks.  That's awesome if you're worried that mortgage-backed securities are tanking in value and the Fed can come along and prop up their value until the panic is over.  That's a concern today but it was a much bigger concern back in 2008 when the housing bubble burst. 
 It is useless if your goal is to get money into the hands of people or small businesses that need it to pay rent or pay their mortgages today.  If Congress wants to get money to those folks, it has to pass legislation to spend the money.

Fed spending is also very different from Congressional spending because the Fed is generally buying (or lending against) assets, it's not generating spending that drives demand.  Most of the Fed's $1.5 T involves going to banks that have some assets and saying ""Hey, nice assets.  We'd love to give you a cheap loan if you put those assets up as collateral.""  That ensures that banks have plenty of money on hand to be able to lend out and ensures that there is a willing buyer for whatever assets the Fed is lending against.  Eventually, though, banks are going to give the Fed back that $1.5 T with a small bit of interest.

"I've seen mentioned in an article from March that:


  Earlier this month, [Rand] Paul, a licensed physician, voted against a bipartisan $8 billion emergency coronavirus funding bill. He was the sole senator to vote against.


How did he vote on the subsequent, even bigger, Covid-related stimulus  packages?
","We can see here how Paul voted on the bill you mention in your question, when he was the sole Senator to vote against the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act. Subsequently, he also was one of eight Republicans who voted against the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.

As Paul tested positive for COVID-19 on or before 22nd March, and went into quarantine, he was unable to take part in the various cloture votes on the CARES Act, nor the subsequent 96-0 vote on the final bill, and is recorded as not voting.

Interestingly, he did release a statement on March 20th that said he would shortly introduce his COVID-19 Recovery Act, which he said would provide ""relief to American families and businesses without adding to the skyrocketing debt that also threatens our country.""

Given the passage of the CARES Act, this seems to have now been shelved.
"
"Given the lack of critical assessment in the US media of China's massive quarantine, I think that there are many people in the US who would view it acceptable to shut down a major American city to prevent the spreading of an outbreak.  However, I worry that no one is considering the consequences of such action.  

With major parts of the economy no longer functioning, people would have difficulty with things like finding child care.  This has trickle down effects, such as pharmacy staff staying at home with their children.  This may lead to lethal consequences.  

Examples of trickle down effects:


Cancer survivors can't access health care (this is currently happening in China). 
Lack of access to medicine.  This can be deadly to people with severe chronic conditions (e.g. heart disease).
Lack of social support (e.g. no one is checking in on Grandma).


Question: 

Do policy makers (in either China or the US) consider the unintended consequences of large quarantines?  If so whose advising them and studying those effects?  Is the decision to quarantine based off of a process or is it based off of an executive leader's 'intuition'.  

My 'intuition' is that these unintentional effects may be killing more people than covid 19.

Positive Reaction to China's response:


Donald Trump's Light touch towards China
Trump says China is handling coronavirus 'professionally'


Yes, I've heard mild criticism of China's handling of this, but it generally doesn't focus on negative effects on quarantine. They generally focus on China's lack of transparency and lack of action.
","In the US there are two federal agencies the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Federal Emergency Management Agency that have larges staffs of physicians, epidemiologists, public health, and disaster management professionals. Those staffs spend a lot of their time worrying about questions like this, and gaming out different scenarios, just like the military games out battle strategies. There is also a large academic community of public health specialists that study problems like this. See for example these academic papers:

Quarantine, isolation and the duty of easy rescue in public health


  We address the issue of whether, why and under what conditions,
  quarantine and isolation are morally justified, with a particular
  focus on measures implemented in the developing world. We argue that
  the benefits of quarantine and isolation justify some level of
  coercion or compulsion by the state, but that the state should be able
  to provide the strongest justification possible for implementing such
  measures.


The Challenge Of Mandatory Evacuation: Providing For And Deciding For


  Insufficient attention has been given to the ethical and legal
  questions surrounding mandatory evacuation in disasters and
  emergencies. We argue that mandatory evacuation orders entail a
  governmental duty both to provide for people and to decide for people:
  Government must trigger the provision of critical resources as well as
  vigorous and persistent efforts to persuade reluctant citizens to
  leave.


Of course the political powers might choose to not to follow the advice of their professional staff or outside professionals, but that comes with grave political risks if the situation goes south. The political powers might also receive contradictory advice from different groups of professionals. Which experts should they listen to?

There is also the chance that even with the best of intentions and the best available information, the experts will make the wrong call, or apply the ""lessons of the last battle"" in the wrong situation. 

These are hard questions. For example, in In August 2005 Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and over 1800 people were killed. The governments of Louisiana and New Orleans we broadly criticized for not fully evacuating the city. Later in 2005 Hurricane Rita was projected to hit Houston and a mandatory evacuation was ordered. Dozens of people died in the evacuation of Houston, from heat stroke, accidents, and a tragic bus fire. As it turned out, Hurricane Rita struck Houston only a passing blow, and fewer people died in the storm than in the evacuation. New lesson learned: don't evacuate, shelter in place, evacuate only those most at risk. Then in 2017 Hurricane Harvey hit Houston, causing massive flooding, and requiring the rescue of thousands of people trapped in floodwaters. And afterwards everyone was asking Why Didn't Houston Evacuate?.

Predicting the future is hard.

"This sort of builds up on this and this previous question. Both of them ask about if the President can block the transfer of their office to a successor.

In response to the current Coronavirus pandemic, many states are encouraging people to use “social distancing” methods and canceling large public events to prevent the spread of the disease. With large numbers of people using the same voting booths and voting machines, in-person voting seems like it could provide an effective vector for the spread of the disease, and if the pandemic continues to get worse it’s possible to imagine in-person voting being significantly disrupted.

In this situation, what would happen if the coronavirus (or another pandemic) significantly disrupted in-person voting for the Presidential election? Would the election be delayed, or are there mechanisms to enforce a change in voting methods? In this kind of hypothetical situation, how would the successor of the U.S. President be (s)elected?
","First, this has never really happened in the United States. In extreme emergencies and national disasters, elections have been held a few days late, but never suspended (unlike, for example, the United Kingdom, that suspended elections during World War II). Elections were also not canceled during the Civil War, or as a result of the War of 1812 (during which the U.S. capitol was burned to the ground by foreign military forces).

For example, elections were not prevented from being conducted by the Spanish flu of 1918 which was in all respects deadlier and more contagious than the coronavirus, despite the fact that the technology available for a response in 1918 was less advanced.

Realistically, you would need a disease that is catastrophic on the scale of the Black Plague in medieval Europe (that killed a third to a half of the population in many places), and not merely something like the coronavirus (with a 2% mortality rate), to take out the electoral process in the U.S.

A situation like that would involve the collapse of the entire regime and government, and would send us into uncharted waters.

Second, election laws can be changed quite quickly in an emergency. One could, for example, shift as Colorado has, to a system of near complete all mail in ballots, to reduce the amount of in person interactions that were needed.

The U.S. Constitution does not provide the option of not conducting an election. In the absence of an election, elected offices become vacant and the succession provisions of the law which usually kick in when there is a death during someone's term of office would kick in. U.S. Senate vacancies can be filled in most states by Governors on a temporary basis. U.S. House seats that go vacant must be filled in vacancy elections. There is a line of succession to the Presidency defined by law involving a few key Congressional leaders and the cabinet.

"Has the World Health Organisation (WHO) or any government anywhere conducted random tests for COVID-19?

It is announced today that in Britain they are going to step up the testing from 1,500 people per day to 10,000. Will any of these be from a random cohort?

It would seem to me that one random batch of say 5,000 people would tell us a lot about the extent of infection in the community, and hence the relative dangers of getting the disease.

If the results of an election can be accurately predicted from a random opinion poll survey of 1000 people, then it would seem that we could learn a lot about the virus from random testing - in different parts of the country - and something well worth doing!
","The small Italian town of Vò has tested and retested its entire population.


  Through testing and retesting of all 3,300 inhabitants of the town of Vò, near Venice, regardless of whether they were exhibiting symptoms, and rigorous quarantining of their contacts once infection was confirmed, health authorities have been able to completely stop the spread of the illness there.
  
  [...]
  
  The first testing round, carried out on the town’s entire population in late February, found 3 per cent of the population infected, though half of the carriers had no symptoms. After isolating all those infected, the second testing round about 10 days later showed the infection rate had dropped to 0.3 per cent.

"I am wondering if President Trump has the constitutional authority to ban all remaining presidential primary elections in all the states in an effort to contain the Coronavirus outbreak? 
","Probably not. The primaries are not under Federal jurisdiction (and in some states, they're actually run by the party and not the state).

In practical terms, the Trump line continues to be everything's fine and we'll be back to normal soon so it's hard to imagine him taking such a step (although this could change if he thought it would benefit him politically).

"I have the impression that Italy has adopted some if not all the ""Chinese playbook"" on COVID-19, including a large scale lock-down. That may well be justified given that the number of new cases appears to be declining in China, something that the WHO has labelled ""impressive"".

What I want to ask though: is there a more detailed ""checklist"" of measures contrasting how Italy and China's responses to the virus compare? E.g., what precise activities were restricted.
","I can give some information about the Italian lockdown. Source: the FAQ from the Italian ministry of internal affairs.

What you can do


go to work (any kind EDIT: on March 21, as an additional restriction, ""non-essential"" businesses were stopped). Telecommuting / remote working is recommended when possible.
travel for work (for instance, plumbers can go visit their clients).
commute between different cities for work reasons.
go visit the shops that are still open: food, pharmacy/chemists, newspaper's agents, tobacconists, bars and restaurants on motorways, some grocery and personal item shops, hardware stores, laundries... While doing so, customers must be at a distance of 1 m one from the other.
in particular, you can get out to buy newspapers.
return to your main residence (wherever you are).
go tend to elderly relatives.
divorced parents can go visit their children.
dispose of trash.
walk your dog (EDIT: in some regions, this was further restricted: one cannot go further than 200m from one's house for this reason), or take it to the vet for urgent matters.
go running or practicing (individual) sports (EDIT: in some regions, this was further restricted: one cannot go further than 200m from one's house for this reason).
use a bike for an authorized purpose (e.g., as a sport, or to commute).
there is no limitation to the number, length, or frequency of outside trips, as long as they are all for authorized reasons.


What you cannot do


if you have fever or other symptoms it is ""strongly recommended"" to stay at home.
go to a secondary place of residence such as a a holiday home.
go for a walk without any other purpose.
all kind of gatherings: discos, cinemas, pubs, theaters, etc. are closed.
all schools and universities are closed.
religious gatherings are suspended (e.g. Sunday mass).
""non-essential"" (see above) shops are closed.


What happens to transgressors

Police can stop people to check that they are out for a legitimate purpose. Transgressors can be arrested (up to 3 months) or fined (up to 206€), and the violation will enter their criminal record. Shops that disobey regulations will be closed for 5 up to 30 days. 

Numerous violations have already been reported: this newspaper article mentions 46000 violations reported by the authorities and 1500 closed shops in the past week of lockdown.

There have been various appeals from various artists and public figures urging Italians to stay at home and respect these measures (see e.g. this Youtube search).

Comparison with China

I do not have direct experience, but from what I understand measures in China were more severe: for instance this Wikipedia article mentions that 


  [in many cities, districts, and counties across mainland China] only one person from each household is permitted to go outside for provisions once every two days, except for medical reasons or to work at shops or pharmacies.


I welcome a similar answer from the point of view of Chinese citizens.

"Every country so far has been working on enforcing social distancing measures to tackle the COVID-19 epidemic, with El Salvador going as far as to isolate the entire country before they've received their first patient. This caused nearly ever major event to be cancelled and caused tremendous losses for the economy. But is there already a long term plan on bringing the economy back to life? Surely countries cannot just live in quarantine forever? 

Only notable exception that I'm aware of is Boris Johnson announcing that the UK will be following a different approach:


  Defending Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision not to follow other European countries by closing schools and banning mass gatherings, Patrick Vallance said it was the government’s aim to “reduce the peak of the epidemic, pull it down and broaden it” while protecting the elderly and vulnerable


So the UK's long term plan seems to be ""business as usual"", but what about others?
","
Germany has pretty supportive laws in place for people who are personally quarantined, basically paid sick days off. This will have the effect of supporting domestic demand during the crisis.
That does not cover the general economic downturn for people who are not directly sick or quarantined, so the government decided on tax deferments and a loan program for businesses.
There is also the possibility of payments from the unemployment insurance system for workers who had their working hours reduced, this allows companies to avoid layoffs.

"
"I was watching President Trump's white house daily briefing for Coronavirus and I see officials standing too close to each other which is a different issue. But one thing I am wondering is everyone staring at the president nonstop without looking at the audience? Is there a specific etiquette they are following?


","From a political psychology standpoint...

The people in the photo are the members of the president's cabinet (or their staff). That means they are all either direct reports and/or political subordinates of the president. They all serve at the pleasure of the president. Therefore, there is a certain element of political psychology at play.

Specifically, they all must uphold the appearance being a loyal member of the president's team above all. Therefore, they must show all the outward signs of respect and being a good listener. Visually, this includes focusing their attention on him while he is speaking and maintaining respectful body language. Otherwise, they undermine the president's leadership and their respective security and effectiveness in their cabinet or staff position. 
"
"I noticed that a lot of countries introducing quarantines and other measures to fight COVID-19 also included a ban on people gathering. I am wondering, how can it be enforced?

When a government wants to stop people protests and similar actions the ban can be easily enforced, because protesters must put themselves in evidence otherwise their protest would have no purpose. But in the case of an epidemic the ban should prevent also people gathering in a discreet manner in a backstreet or a public garden. No country, not even the authoritarian ones have enough policemen to monitor every single corner. 

Furthermore if people violate the ban and refuse to pay the fine, what are they going to do? Put them in a crowded prison? Wouldn't that defeat the purpose?

Last detail if there are limits in the way a ban can be enforced. How effective can a ban be at preventing public gatherings? 

Edit: 

I would like to point out something that none of the answers considers. When a government gives an order, or issues a prohibition, then they have to enforce it, it is also a strong commitment for the state itself. This means devoting a large portion of the police force to it while they could have been employed for other tasks. Furthermore the stronger the prohibition the higher the chance that some people may eventually challenge it and lead to confrontations with the police forces.

Had there been just a ban on public events plus a recommendation to people not to gather in big number, without such a strong commitment, what would have been the difference in effectiveness and pressure put on the police force and other state resources?
","
  I am wondering, how can it be enforced?


By the authorities, wielding the law and their monopoly on the use of force. I think society, the mainstream media and social media will also create social pressure and consequences.

Obviously the effectiveness of the ban depends on the proportion of people abiding by it. That a minority will inevitably flout the ban does not mean the ban is wholly useless.


  Furthermore if people violate the ban and refuse to pay the fine, what
  are they going to do? Put them in a crowded prison?


Yes, ban violators might be imprisoned.

https://english.elpais.com/spanish_news/2020-03-15/members-of-the-spanish-public-face-fines-or-even-prison-if-they-disobey-lockdown-rules.html


  Wouldn't that defeat the purpose?


If the person is not infected, the prisoners are no worse off. If the person is infected, perhaps he or she can be put in solitary confinement or a repurposed toilet paper warehouse. Whether the person is infected or not infected, society is better off. 

There is no country on the planet that can cope with large proportions of their populations being hospitalised (particularly if they need intensive care or mechanical ventilation), which is one of the things that such a ban is intended to reduce the risk of.
"
"Is there a way to objectively measure or compare how much people believe different governments?

For example, people have accused China of a propaganda campaign to cover up the origins of COVID-19. Another dictatorial regime, Iran, seems to be among the countries hit hardest by the outbreak. On the other hand, North Korea, reports zero known cases of infection.

If one were to ask about non-governmental sources of information, we can point to something like mediabiasfactcheck and other fact-checkers. But those don't exist for governments.

Is there a way to measure and objectively compare how much ""the rest of the world"" believes the information coming out of the government of any given country?
","This has been explored by Berens et al. [1], from the Reputation Institute, the publishers of the annual RepTrak country reputation rankings. In their chapter in the International Place Branding Yearbook 2011, they provide an overview of their methodology, which seeks to measure a country's reputation in much the same way that one might measure the reputation of an individual or a company. 

They argue that this reputation is linked intrinsically to the overall international trust of a country, something which is backed up by Klewes &amp; Wreschniok [2], which states that the link between reputation and trust is ""fundamental and indispensable"", arguing that "" trust is based on the experience
that an agent has fulfilled our expectations in the past.""

They list 11 different attributes, which fit into three different dimensions. These are:


Advanced Economy


An important contributor to global culture
Is technologically advanced
Is inventive
Produces high-quality products and services

Appealing Environment


Offers appealing lifestyle
An enjoyable country
A beautiful country

Effective Government 


Offers a favorable environment for doing business
Has adopted progressive social and economic policies
Is a responsible participant in the global community
Is run by an effective government



The testing methodology consisted of a large random sample (n=26,000) of consumers in the G8 countries, combined with an additional sample (n=19,000) from the country in question drawn from its own citizens. Responses were adjusted to take into account general per-country bias - for example, respondents from Greece generally will have a good opinion of Cyprus.

A further dimension which was measured was ""Supportive Behaviors"". This measured the willingness of consumers to visit, live in, invest in, work in, and buy products from the country.

In conclusion then, while the study in question is conducted by surveying populations, it seems possible that a similar study could be conducted which measures at least some of these criteria objectively. Certainly, factors such as ""willingness to invest"" and ""technological advancement"" could be measured using economic data. However, it would seem that the best way to measure the reputation of a country will probably be to survey the opinions of global respondents through large-scale polling, as the factors that the study found had the most effect on a country's reputation were attributes such as ""Offers an appealing lifestyle"", ""Is a responsible participant in the global community"", and ""Is a beautiful country"", which would seem to be more abstract factors.

"In today's press conference (3/19/2020) the President is touting the FDA's approval of using (for example) an anti-malarial as a treatment for COVID-19. This drug has been in widespread use and has been approved by the FDA for years. HOWEVER, the FDA required drug information on this drug does NOT mention COVID-19, so it's use as a pharm for COVID-19 would be considered off-label. 

Physicians commonly order these off-label applications, however they assume the risk and liability by ordering off-label pharms for their patients.

Considering today's assertion that FDA has now approved certain pharms, does it follow that these prescriptions are no longer ""off-label"", but rather are indicated uses.

No.  The president is not the FDA, and the president's statements about FDA actions are not FDA actions.  The only official source of information about drug approvals is the FDA's list of approved drugs.  See 21 CFR 314.3:


  Listed drug is a new drug product that has been approved under section 505(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for safety and effectiveness or under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which has not been withdrawn or suspended under section 505(e)(1) through (5) or section 505(j)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and which has not been withdrawn from sale for what FDA has determined are reasons of safety or effectiveness. Listed drug status is evidenced by the drug product's identification in the current edition of FDA's “Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (the list) as an approved drug. A drug product is deemed to be a listed drug on the date of approval for the NDA or ANDA for that drug product.

"Multiple sources have reported that Canada and the United States have announced that the Canada–United States border is about to close to non-essential travel in an effort to reduce the spread of Covid-19. For example, see https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/essential-travel-coronavirus/index.html


  ""Well I think essential is medical, we have military working together, we have industry working together, and again, it's not affecting trade, so things like that,"" said President Trump. ""But just leisurely 'let's go to a restaurant and have dinner,' which a lot of people do ... we have ended on a temporary basis."" 


When was the last time either Canada or the US banned citizens or residents of the other from visiting for tourism or other non-essential purposes? My guess is the War of 1812, but I can't seem to find the answer online.
","Never. Only in the early wars between France and England, but then it didn’t mind whether the enemies were in which territory and the border were unclear and the definition of the border was the cause of the war. 

How would they have been able to 

a) control a border that was the longest of the world 

b) of two countries that haven’t been fully explored

c) and the border wasn’t clearly defined. 

even not 1850.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_War_(1859)

And what sense would it make to close a border of 2 countries if you can’t control it as there are so few inhabitants like in Montana, Idaho, Wyoming etc?

Even today it must be rather a symbolic gesture to close the border: Highways, Railway, Airports.

"I have not seen articles or information on how governments - behind the scenes or in public - reflect and set up analytics and systematic information collection to prepare for the spread of a new viral pandemic.

What sources can show more information about what politicians think about preparing for future pandemics right now?
","Right now, as Covid-19 is on-going, they can't do very much to prepare for a hypothetical Covid-??. However, once the Covid-19 situation has ended, then it would be vital to do a thorough analysis of what worked, and didn't work in the Covid-19 situation.

This is one of the reasons, why the East-Asian countries, such as Hong Kong or Korea have fared so well compared to Europe; they could build on first hand experience of the SARS and MERS outbreaks.

The somewhat sad lesson is that we are smarter only afterwards. Any attempts to predict the future, and act accordingly to these predictions is bound to fail at least in part of the cases.

You find plenty of articles in the media, comparing the current, local situation to those in the East Asian countries, such as this one from the BBC. Whereever, you are from, you probably will be able to find a corresponding article from your local media, at least I have found such articles from German media.

"Italy now has the most deaths from COVID. It's even above China in that list.

Italian government asked for international help, some countries responded:


At first, China provided huge help
then, suddenly, Cuba send medical crew
and then Russia send military virusologists


It is a very surprising to me, that western media not provide information about western help programs - Italy is a NATO member since it foundation, and also member of EU.

Are there any western programs for helping Italy in fighting COVID-19? I'm sure there are - because it would be very strange if such alliances do not tight together on foreign threats.
","The latest one from Germany are 300 respiratory machines. I don't think that is labeled as either EU or NATO.

"Senator Burr is currently being accused of using insider information to sell his stock in advance of the coronavirus epidemic:


  Burr had been receiving daily coronavirus updates from the intelligence community in his role as committee chairman, per a Feb. 27 report by Reuters. After writing a Feb. 7 Fox News op-ed that said the U.S. is ""better prepared than ever before"" to face public health threats such as COVID-19, he sold between $628,000 and $1.72 million in stocks on Feb. 13, ProPublica reported.


But what non-public information did Burr receive? China being put into lockdown was public information and was discussed by the media around the world. The first American coronavirus patient was diagnosed on January 19th in Washington and this was likewise public information. The virus spreading to Italy and other European countries was in the news in late January as well.

So what exactly did Senator Burr do wrong? What information could he have possibly obtained that wasn't in the news by early-mid February?
","The information that US intelligence services warned about a likely pandemic.

It's one thing to know that there was one case in Washington or a lockdown in China, but another to know if an informed source such as US intelligence services consider it a threat.

This Politico article goes into a bit more depths about this and the difficulty in actually prosecuting cases like this.

Regarding what he did ""wrong"", there's also the issue of him not speaking out about Trumps misleading statements downplaying the crisis when he seemingly knew better.
"
"The ""Daily"" NY Times podcast for 3/12/20 described two effective management schemes for handling the epidemic.  Briefly:

Chinese: Check everyone's temperature frequently on a massive scale.  Track individuals with QR codes.  Use a flow chart procedure to confirm or eliminate a COVID hypothesis, and put affected individuals in government quarantine as needed, separating confirmed cases within a family so as to minimize contagion within families.

The flow chart procedure was describe as follows: screen for body temperature and cough. Eliminate bacterial infection and allergy as possible. Cat scan for pneumonia.

Also an NPR report described an online support group led by a social worker that included quarantine graduates who gave descriptions of quarantine living conditions, including food, and gave advice about what to take along to quarantine.  These services apparently helped people cope positively with fears of quarantine.

South Korean: Extensive testing and thorough, meticulous exposure tracing.

My question is, would it be possible to implement one or both of these in the United States (or Europe)?
","""From the helicopter"" there is now a more general claim (e.g. in the following McKinsey slide) that Western countries are trying to emulate China and/or South Korea's response:



The devil might be in the details, of course. Getting to the details might be too involved/broad in a question like this, not specific to a pair of countries. There's for example a China-US comparison in a recent BI article, too long to quote here in its entirety, of course. But some things that were probably not done in the West was a complete shutdown of travel, e.g.


  ""These draconian measures seem to have worked to bring down the cases in a very short period of time in China,"" Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Business Insider. ""Although there is a cost to the economy, to society, not to mention also the second-order problems, like access to health care for people without the coronavirus. The question is whether the United States is willing to pay such a high price."" [...] Huang says he cannot imagine an America where many of these measures are implemented. [...]
  
  During the height of the outbreak, trains didn't stop at the disease's epicenter, Wuhan. [...] ""Cutting off transportation was considered on the top three measures to contain the spread of the virus,"" Huang told Business Insider. ""But it would hard to imagine the complete shutdown of an American city due to government order.""


And regarding tracking of people's movement


  ""It would be a big change right for the US people to get accustomed to,"" said Huang, ""if the government wants to use this high tech means, like using the cell phones to monitor the movement of the people.""
  
  Huang added that even though there is little technological barrier to doing this, this kind of behavior is considered a form of digital authoritarianism, that involves uses privacy issues. Huang would be hard-pressed to imagine the US government using this approach to containing the spread of the coronavirus.


China also apparently co-opted every (""private"") security guard in the effort to keep people in their homes:


  ""In America, you have to stay at home, but there's no police,"" said Huang. ""There's no one actively enforcing that rule, but in China, you have what are basically security guards on patrol of every residence to make sure they don't violate the government containment measures. That's a kind of approach I think can't be copied here in the United States.""


Likewise for suspending ""non-essential"" medical access:


  In China, elective surgeries and other non-critical doctors visits were delayed, and many medical services were moved online. [...]  But the move hasn't been without negative consequences. One man with kidney disease in China jumped to his death, Human Rights Watch reported. He couldn't get dialysis during the outbreak. Another boy with cerebral palsy died after being left alone for six days while his father was quarantined in China. 


A similar opinion was voiced in a Time interview:


  “No other nation (western or otherwise) can or should seek to replicate China’s actions,” Thomas Bollyky, the director of the Global Health Program at the Washington D.C.-based Council on Foreign Relations, tells TIME via email. “The disregard for civil liberties and human rights that the government has demonstrated in its quarantine and censorship activities are inseparable from the policies and actions of the government that contributed to the outbreak in the first place.”


Other experts quoted earlier in a Science (news) piece were also skeptical that the full extent of China's measures could be copied in the West:


  The question now is whether the world can take lessons from China’s apparent success—and whether the massive lockdowns and electronic surveillance measures imposed by an authoritarian government would work in other countries. [...]
  
  “This report poses difficult questions for all countries currently considering their response to COVID-19,” says Steven Riley, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London. “The joint mission was highly productive and gave a unique insight into China’s efforts to stem the virus from spread within mainland China and globally,” adds Lawrence Gostin, a global health law scholar at Georgetown University. But Gostin warns against applying the model elsewhere. “I think there are very good reasons for countries to hesitate using these kinds of extreme measures.”
  
  There’s also uncertainty about what the virus, dubbed SARS-CoV-2, will do in China after the country inevitably lifts some of its strictest control measures and restarts its economy. COVID-19 cases may well increase again.


More recent cases from Hong Kong indicate that that fear of re-emergence may well be have been justified. So Hong Kong is back into lock down after it was largely lifted at the beginning of March.

Similar expert opinion on restrictions timing:


  Epidemiologists say China’s mammoth response had one glaring flaw: it started too late. In the initial weeks of the outbreak in December and January, Wuhan authorities were slow to report cases of the mysterious infection, which delayed measures to contain it, says Howard Markel, a public-health researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “The delay of China to act is probably responsible for this world event,” says Markel.
  
  A model simulation by Lai Shengjie and Andrew Tatem, emerging-disease researchers at the University of Southampton, UK, shows that if China had implemented its control measures a week earlier, it could have prevented 67% of all cases there. Implementing the measures 3 weeks earlier, from the beginning of January, would have cut the number of infections to 5% of the total. [...]
  
  But between 16 and 30 January, a period that included the first 7 days of the lockdown, the number of people each infected individual gave the virus to dropped to 1.05, estimates Adam Kucharski, who models infectious-disease spread at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “That was amazing,” he says. [...]
  
  “These extreme limitations on population movement have been quite successful,” says Michael Osterholm, an infectious-disease scientist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. [... However,] China is suppressing the virus, not eradicating it, says Osterholm. The world will need to wait until about eight weeks after China resumes to some form of normality to know what it did or didn’t accomplish with its population-movement limitations, he says.
  
  There is probably a fierce debate going on in China about when to relax the lockdown measures, says Roy Anderson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London. He suggests there could be a second wave of new infections when they are lifted.


So whether it's possible to (fully) emulate China's response (in the West) depends not only on the political framework, but also to which experts the (Western) governments might be paying [most] attention to.

I realize this is a long answer already, but there was a recent interview with one of China's [own] CDC officials (whom seldom get interviewed in the West). Some interesting points from there:


  Q: What mistakes are other countries making?
  
  A: The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren’t wearing masks. [...]
  
  Q: People who tested positive in Wuhan but only had mild disease were sent into isolation in large facilities and were not allowed to have visits from family. Is this something other countries should consider?
  
  A: Infected people must be isolated. [...]
  
  Q: Spread in China has dwindled to a crawl, and the new confirmed cases are mainly people entering the country, correct?
  
  A: Yes. At the moment, we don’t have any local transmission, but the problem for China now is the imported cases. So many infected travelers are coming into China.




More recently (April 2) it has been reported by DW that Germany is considering a voluntary phone app similar to the (mandatory?) one[s] used in China:


  The most famous health app was developed by the tech giant Alibaba in conjunction with the Chinese authorities. Other companies have also developed similar software, however. It was possible to work swiftly because the Chinese state already has access regarding citizens' movements and programmers did not have to worry about data protection laws. [...]
  
  There are many who hope that Germany will soon be using such an app. The Health Ministry and researchers at the Robert Koch Institute are developing similar software. The idea is to introduce a non-compulsory app that will not be able to detect who met whom and where but will be able to identify if a phone user was in close contact with another infected user.
  
  The app will only really be able to function if 60 percent of the population uses it. In Germany, it won't be as easy as in Asia to reach such a percentage.
  
  Will Germans cooperate?
  
  Half of the respondents to a recent poll said they would not oppose an app to help warn users who had come into contact with someone infected with COVID-19. 


They don't link to the poll, but I guess in was a poll in Germany given that this was an article on DW.

There's now a BBC video discussing Chinese-inspired surveillance measures to combat the outbreak. This is of course somewhat subjective, but they only short-listed Singapore, Israel, Iran, Taiwan and Russia as being closest to China-style surveillance measures used to combat the epidemic, like using CCTV cameras and phone tracking.
"
"At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization initially opposed countries instituting travel or trade restrictions.



Why did they oppose these policies at that time? Is there any evidence that non-medical considerations such as political pressure played a role in the World Health Organization's decision?
","Probably because prior WHO research was rather skeptical of their ultimate effectiveness:  


  Screening and quarantining entering travelers at international borders did not substantially delay virus introduction in past pandemics, except in some island countries, and will likely be even less effective in the modern era.


That paper was co-authored (on behalf of the WHO) by employees of the [US] CDC (lead author actually), the ECDC, the UK's HPA, Australian DHA, and some of WHO's own employees. So you could say it was a fairly broad consensus at the time it was written (2006).

The WHO has actually explained/defended their reasoning in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak in more detail in a February press release:


  WHO continues to advise against the application of travel or trade restrictions to countries experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks.
  
  In general, evidence shows that restricting the movement of people and goods during public health emergencies is ineffective in most situations and may divert resources from other interventions. Furthermore, restrictions may interrupt needed aid and technical support, may disrupt businesses, and may have negative social and economic effects on the affected countries. However, in certain circumstances, measures that restrict the movement of people may prove temporarily useful, such as in settings with few international connections and limited response capacities.
  
  Travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic may only be justified at the beginning of an outbreak, as they may allow countries to gain time, even if only a few days, to rapidly implement effective preparedness measures. Such restrictions must be based on a careful risk assessment, be proportionate to the public health risk, be short in duration, and be reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves.
  
  Travel bans to affected areas or denial of entry to passengers coming from affected areas are usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases but may have a significant economic and social impact. Since WHO declaration of a public health emergency of international concern in relation to COVID-19, and as of 27 February, 38 countries have reported to WHO additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic in relation to travel to and from China or other countries, ranging from denial of entry of passengers, visa restrictions or quarantine for returning travellers. Several countries that denied entry of travellers or who have suspended the flights to and from China or other affected countries, are now reporting cases of COVID-19.
  
  Temperature screening alone, at exit or entry, is not an effective way to stop international spread, since infected individuals may be in incubation period, may not express apparent symptoms early on in the course of the disease, or may dissimulate fever through the use of antipyretics; in addition, such measures require substantial investments for what may bear little benefits. [...]


I haven't found more recent press releases on this matter, especially after the US and the EU have imposed much more wider travel bans. I do wonder the extent to which the WHO might have reconsidered that initial approach...

Aside, comment on the question... I wonder why you found it necessary to use ""that guy from India"" as the motivator for this question when (in the US) a poll published on March 26 says...


  In thinking about specific steps that have been announced to address the coronavirus outbreak, majorities of Republicans and Democrats view a range of measures as necessary to stem the spread of the virus. For example, overwhelming majorities of both Republicans (96%) and Democrats (94%) say restricting international travel to the U.S. is necessary.

"
"The US has enacted law H.R.6201 - Families First Coronavirus Response Act which seems to mainly tackle elementary/secondary students' food availability, but also expanded FMLA among other things. I've seen various posts on Facebook that are, at best, outdated or, at worst, straight-up false. Some of the posts I've seen state that the US is requiring 2-week paid leave. But the summary of the law makes it sound like that falls to the state's unemployment program. When reading the actual text of the law regarding paid leave, it states that the first 10 days are unpaid; any leave after that is paid. So what does paid leave look like then?

For example, my place of business is shutting down next week, March 30th, and maybe subsequent weeks. I'm told that I can use PTO (of which I have none) or draw unemployment. Assuming that COVID-19 cases skyrocket in my county and we shutdown for more than 10 days, do I start getting paid on Day 11?

To further muddy the water, there is an exemption for businesses with fewer than 50 employees. I think this replaces the previous exemption of businesses with more than 500 employees. 

If the above is correct, let's say my factory (in Kansas) has 150 employees, but is owned by a company (national, but headquartered in Michigan) with >>500 employees. The company is a subsidiary of a larger, international corporation (I have no idea how many are employed under the corporation). 

Do I still qualify for paid leave on Day 1? Day 11? Not at all (this is America; bootstraps etc)? 

Assume that I am a healthy, essential employee with no children. Why we're still shutting down despite being deemed essential is beyond me.
","The Department of Labor has a nifty Q&amp;A page (Questions 2 and 3 in particular). In short, private sector corporations are considered as a single employer and thus count each employee within the company. If the employee count is greater than 500 the corporation in question is exempt from paid leave due to COVID-19

For what kind of coverage a smaller company can expect, this fact sheet also provided by DoL states that:


  Generally, the Act provides that employees of covered employers are eligible for:
  
  
  Two weeks (up to 80 hours) of paid sick leave at the employee’s regular rate of pay where the employee is unable to work because the employee is quarantined (pursuant to Federal, State, or local government order or advice of a health care provider), and/or experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and seeking a medical diagnosis; or
  Two weeks (up to 80 hours) of paid sick leave at two-thirds the employee’s regular rate of pay because the employee is unable to work because of a bona fide need to care for an individual subject to quarantine (pursuant to Federal, State, or local government order or advice of a health care provider), or to care for a child (under 18 years of age) whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19, and/or the employee is experiencing a substantially similar condition as specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretaries of the Treasury and Labor; and
  Up to an additional 10 weeks of paid expanded family and medical leave at two-thirds the employee’s regular rate of pay where an employee, who has been employed for at least 30 calendar days, is unable to work due to a bona fide need for leave to care for a child whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19.
  


To summarize, paid leave applies if the private sector employee shows symptoms of COVID-19, is told to self-quarantine by health care provider, is quarantined by federal/state/local order, or if employee is taking care of a family member that qualifies for one of the above reasons or if employee's child(ren) is stuck at home due to school/daycare closures related to COVID-19.

Federal employees are still covered by Title II of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which was not amended by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.
"
"With the news that Boris Johnson has tested positive for COVID-19, and was later hospitalised, a question occurred to me: 

What happens if the UK Prime Minister suddenly dies?  

I know that the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the party with the most seats, and presumably the party would somehow choose a new leader as soon as they can.  However, organizing a vote of the Conservative part membership would still require at least a few days under normal circumstances;  and under the current circumstances, it might take significantly longer.  

Is there simply no Prime Minister until the governing party can choose another one?  If so, how are the functions of the head of government performed during this time?

I'd be interested in knowing how this would work (if it's any different) in other Westminster systems as well.  I saw the question on What happens if the UK Prime Minister resigns?, but the answer there assumes a orderly transition period during which the incumbent continues to serve while a new party leader is chosen.  
","Your understanding is correct - there is no UK Prime Minister until one is appointed by the Queen. In the meantime, the Civil Contingencies Act (2004) gives the Monarch (in practice, government ministers) powers to make emergency regulations, and COBRA meetings can be chaired by any Cabinet minister - after 9/11, these were chaired by the Cabinet Secretary until the PM could attend himself.

The Queen will appoint as PM the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons. In practice, this is the person chosen as the leader of the party with the most MPs - in this case, the party that the deceased PM previously led. How this is chosen, and how quickly, will depend on the party in question, although in these circumstances it seems likely that an interim leader would be speedily chosen. The Labour Party's rules for this are described in Steve Melnikoff's answer here. In the case of the Conservative Party, their constitution states under Schedule 2 - Rules for the Election of the Leader that:


  
  Upon the initiation of an election for the Leader, it shall be the
  duty of the 1922 Committee to present to the Party, as soon as
  reasonably practicable, a choice of candidates for election as Leader.
  The rules for deciding the procedure by which the 1922 Committee
  selects candidates for submission for election shall be determined by
  the Executive Committee of the 1922 Committee after consultation of
  the Board. 
  If there is only one candidate at the time laid down for
  the close of nominations, that candidate shall be declared Leader of
  the Party.
  


It would be possible, then, for MPs to be strongly encouraged to only nominate one candidate in order to conclude this process as quickly as possible, without a full membership vote. You may remember in 2016, for example, Andrea Leadson withdrew from the leadership contest leaving Theresa May as the sole candidate, which meant that there was no ballot of the party membership.

In the specific case you raise, however, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was given the role of 'Designated Survivor' on March 22nd, and will carry out Johnson's duties that he can't perform himself while he is affected by the virus. It should be noted that this role is not an official post, and if Johnson were to die from the virus then it is not a given that Raab would be appointed leader of the party and therefore the new PM. In fact, the article notes that this designation was challenged by some in the Cabinet, who thought that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, should have been given the role, and  indeed; Gove replaced Johnson at the daily press briefing on March 27th. Another contender might be Jeremy Hunt, against whom Johnson won the Conservative  Party leadership election in 2019.

As for other Westminster systems, there is no blanket answer to that question. It is perfectly possible for a bill to be introduced that immediately designates the new Prime Minister on their death, as in the US system. Indeed, in 2013, Peter Bone MP introduced the Prime Minister (Replacement) Bill, which contains the following provision:


  In the event of the death or incapacitation of a person holding the
  title of Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury, the title,
  salary and functions of that role shall be conferred upon another
  Secretary or Minister of State in accordance with the following order
  of precedence— 
  
  
  (a) person bearing the designation of Deputy Prime
  Minister; 
  (b) Secretary of State with responsibility for Home Affairs;
  (c) Secretary of State with responsibility for Defence;
  ...
  


This bill did not make it onto the statute books, but it proves the point that it is possible for an order of succession to exist in a Westminster system.

"So far the Western nations I'm aware of seem to be trending towards the Chinese/South Korean plan for coronavirus containment:


Lockdown the entire country until the number of new cases is manageable
Introduce localized quarantines and contact tracing to minimize the number of new infections
Wait for the vaccine or cure


However point #3 is risky, as no one is sure if a vaccine can be at all created or if an effective enough cure can be developed. Therefore it might be tempting for some countries to go for an alternative approach in an attempt to balance the risks. Have any countries officially (or at least indirectly) announced such a plan? Some alternative solutions I'm aware of:


""Do nothing"" 
Isolating the elderly, but no general quarantine
Chickenpox style variolation, similar to the pox parties of the past
Maintaining a full lockdown from the world without having the virus locally - 22 countries report this so far


I am aware that the situation is currently evolving around the world, so I expect new answers to trickle in within the next months. 
","If depends quite a bit what you mean by ""plans other than quarantine"". There are of course efforts to test anti-virals and develop a vaccine. But the amount antivirals available might not suffice in the short run, even if they prove [safe and] effective.

Generally speaking however


  Given the lack of testing in Europe and the US, the only way to keep the sick and healthy apart is to keep everyone apart. And that produces a recession.


And the alternative for that would be to test everyone. It's been done at small scale (you'll be amused where) in Italy, in the very first region hit, i.e. in the town of Vò. But the trouble is that testing capacity doesn't quite scale to the ""test everyone in the country"" presently... except maybe in Iceland, the only country I know of that that is doing random testing on a serious scale (relative to the country's size); but it's worth noting that there's convergence between random testing and the chunk of the population that gets tested in Iceland:


  Iceland has tested a far greater proportion of its population than anywhere else on earth, including South Korea — another country touted for its effective response to the pandemic.
  
  But what makes Iceland unique is that test samples are not only taken from ‘high risk’ individuals who have exhibited symptoms, came into contact with known carriers, or returned from countries such as China and Italy, they are also offered to thousands of ordinary members of its general population, who are nonsymptomatic.


On should not discount the level of quarantines imposed in Iceland either though:


  Across this remote and rugged island nation of a little more than 364,000, as of Friday morning there were almost 10,000 men, women and children — equivalent to 9 million Americans — under this form of state-enforced lock and key.


So it's more like ""more of everything"" being done over there rather than ""alternative plans"".



If by plans you mean plans to relax the lockdowns at some point, every country is probably thinking/considering when they can do that. Economists have been spurred into providing answers to hard-choice questions that need to balance economic damage/recession with the lives saved (in the short run). See e.g.


""Managing economic lockdowns in an epidemic"", or in more depth
""The Macroeconomics of Epidemics"" (Eichenbaum et al.); also covered in (the latter half of a) NYT article.


Alas the experience of Hong Kong last week shows that lockdowns may [need to] return in some cases/areas...



I somehow missed the ""odd man out"", in this case, Bolsonaro:


  In a televised address last week, he repeated a now well-worn phrase. ""It's just a little flu or the sniffles,"" he said, blaming the media once again for the hysteria and panic over Covid-19.
  
  A few days later, he clearly demonstrated his prioritisation of the economy over isolation measures favoured by the rest of the world.
  
  ""People are going to die, I'm sorry,"" he said. ""But we can't stop a car factory because there are traffic accidents.""
  
  ""Jair Bolsonaro is alone right now,"" says Brian Winter, editor-in-chief of the publication Americas Quarterly. ""No other major world leader is denying the severity of this to the extent [...]
  
  A few days ago, a video was shared by Jair Bolsonaro's son, Flavio - a politician himself.
  
  The video's message, which claimed to come from the Brazilian government, was that ""BRAZIL CAN'T STOP"" (in Portuguese, #obrasilnãopodeparar). People need to keep working to keep the country safe and the economy growing.
  
  So much so, in fact, that a federal judge on Saturday banned the government from campaigning against isolation measures. Government posts on social media using the hashtag were hastily removed.
  
  ""He's clearly laying the foundation of being able to say six months to a year from now that he did not agree with tough distancing measures, with the lockdown,"" says Oliver Stuenkel, Associate Professor of International Relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Sao Paulo.


That kind of internal power struggle has happened to some extent in Pakistan too, although the military apparently gained the upper hand and managed to impose some level of lockdowns despite opposition from some politicians and clerics. And Khan (like Bolsonaro) also seems to hedge his bets:


  Prime Minister Imran Khan, however, has appeared out of step with local provincial governments. He had previously said a ""lockdown"" would not be sustainable in Pakistan, as it would cause too much harm to those on low incomes.
  
  After provincial governments went ahead and introduced measures tantamount to a ""lockdown"" anyway, Mr Khan attempted to explain he only opposed what he described as a ""curfew,"" while also outlining some measures to protect the poorest in society, who are dependent on daily wages to feed their families. Unlike other Muslim countries, his government has not ordered an end to congregational prayers on Fridays.

"
"CNBC reported that:


  [Dan] Patrick, the Texas lieutenant governor, said Monday on Fox News, “As a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren? And if that is the exchange, I’m all in.”


Apparently on the same show another fairly high profile US politician said


  SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): For a small segment of our population, it's true, the coronavirus can kill you. For a small segment.
  
  But you know what else can kill you? Poverty. Hunger. Losing the entire economy.
  
  And we need to stop thinking about the next election and try to think a little more about the next generation and what we leave to them, which is going to be the little end of nothing if we let this economy collapse.


According to CNN (which alas doesn't link to the actual polls they mention):


  The often-dismissive messaging from Fox News hosts was notable, given that the viewers who make up the network's audience skew older and are thus more vulnerable to the disease.
  
  Polls from both Gallup and Pew Research revealed that Republicans — who are largely distrustful of mainstream news organizations and primarily turn to Fox News and other right-wing sources for information on current events — were much less likely to take the risks of the coronavirus as seriously as their Democratic counterparts.


Of course, this being a rather emotionally charged judgement, it probably matters a lot how one phrases such a question/choice. Still, I want to know if there any surveys in the US on how much the public sees the mortality risk posed by COVID-19 (which as we know is most elevated for the elderly) as acceptable in balance with preserving the ""American way of life"", ""keeping America great"", or some other equivalently formulated socioeconomic normality [for the US]?



Before I get anymore downvotes, please note that I'm not endorsing those views... but they do exist in various shapes, e.g.


  As fears of COVID-19 spread, so too have ageist messages suggesting that the coronavirus is a disease of the old, with internet memes referring to the virus as a ‘boomer remover.’ 


On the less frivolous side, the NYT has an article [sub]titled: ""Shutdown Spotlights Economic Cost of Saving Lives. President Trump and others have asked if halting normal life and commerce to fight the coronavirus is worth the cost. Here’s how economists figure it. [...]


  “Economists should be doing this cost-benefit analysis,” said Walter Scheidel, an economic historian at Stanford University. “Why is nobody putting some numbers on the economic costs of a monthlong or a yearlong shutdown against the lives saved? The whole discipline is well equipped for it. But there is some reluctance for people to stick their neck out.”


(For more on economics aspects of the crisis, see this econ SE question.)

So I think I'm well justified in asking this question, i.e. how widespread such views might be, especially when it comes to making a [hard] choice.
","In the most recent polls I found (and there are a helluva lot of polls on coronavirus in the US) from March 26:


  About seven-in-ten adults (71%) say that to address the coronavirus, it is necessary to require most businesses other than grocery stores or pharmacies to close. A larger share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (81%) than Republicans and GOP leaners (61%) view this requirement as necessary.


So most are (now) approving of not-business-as-usual measures to combat the epidemic. Actually, a bit later, this Pew poll details the public response to a few more specific measures, although this is aftery had been anounced/implemented:



As some [polling] pundits predicted a week ago after commenting on those old-by-now polls (of March 20 or so):


  Pew shows that 59% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say the ""outbreak is a major threat to the health of the U.S. population as a whole,"" while only 33% of Republicans and Republican leaners agree.
  
  It is certainly possible that this significant partisan gap in views of the coronavirus situation will narrow in the weeks ahead. Partisans take cues from the statements of their leaders, and Trump and other Republican politicians initially were publicly skeptical of the significance of the virus, in some instances claiming that it reflected a partisan effort by Democrats and ""the media"" to criticize Trump. Now, Trump and his allies have begun to move away from that previous posture and are at the forefront of proclaiming the seriousness of the crisis. As media observers have noted, this in turn has brought about shifts in the tone of the coverage by Fox News, and these shifts may narrow the partisanship gap in the days and weeks to come if rank-and-file Republicans follow the cues given by their favored thought leaders.

"
"This question posted recently makes a lot of assumptions, including 


  the US President is currently making a trade-off of human lives for the economy 


or 


  Trump's pro-economy death-permissive stance during the COVID-19 crisis


What are the facts backing this claim?
","I can't speak for Rebecca's judgement in interpreting those words of Trump, but for instance a NYT article says:


  “Our people want to return to work,” Mr. Trump declared Tuesday on Twitter, adding, “THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM!”
  
  In essence, he was raising an issue that economists have long grappled with: How can a society assess the trade-off between economic well-being and health? [...]
  
  “We put a lot of weight on saving lives,” said Casey Mulligan, a University of Chicago economist who spent a year as chief economist on Mr. Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers. “But it’s not the only consideration. That’s why we don’t shut down the economy every flu season. They’re ignoring the costs of what they’re doing. They also have very little clue how many lives they’re saving.” [...]
  
  “Making people poorer has health consequences as well,” said Kip Viscusi, an economist at Vanderbilt University who has spent his career using economic techniques to assess the costs and benefits of government regulations.
  
  Jobless people sometimes commit suicide. The poor are likelier to die if they get sick. Mr. Viscusi estimates that across the population, every loss of income of $100 million in the economy causes one additional death.
  
  Government agencies calculate these trade-offs regularly. The Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, has established a cost of about $9.5 million per life saved as a benchmark for determining whether to clean up a toxic waste site.
  
  Other agencies use similar values to assess whether to invest in reducing accidents at an intersection or to tighten safety standards in a workplace. The Department of Agriculture has a calculator to estimate the economic costs — medical care, premature deaths, productivity loss from nonfatal cases — of food-borne disease.


So, the argument [in there] is that governments always make such trade-offs/choices, whether they are incredibly open about them or less so.



I should also mention (here, in case comments get purged again) that the NYT article discusses in a bit more depth the finer points of balancing the economic losses from lockdowns with those that would occur in an unchecked epidemic. This topic has been a addressed in some recent economics publications, e.g. Eichenbaum et al. discussed in the NYT article; but see also a simpler ""lockdowns 101 economics"". For the broader economic aspects of the crisis see also ""The Economics of Coronavirus"" on Econ SE.
"
"From the outside it appears that the coronavirus (CoViD-19) outbreak has caught the USA off guard and that it's been handled quite poorly to date. So my assumption is that this would have a negative effect on what people think about Donald Trump; however, it appears his popularity does not seem to follow a typical set of expectations, so I'd like a more objective assessment of how it's affected the public perception of him. 
","Trump has never had better ratings - but that's not the whole story.

This analysis from the CBC shows a fuller picture.


  Donald Trump has the highest approval ratings since the first few weeks of his presidency.


a 47% approval rating

However he has also had the lowest approval ratings of any president on average, never once having had an approval rate of more than 50%, and averaging around 43%. The last few weeks is the first time since March 2017 his approval has been higher than his disapproval.

Also all leaders have been polling better in this crisis, and most have been polling much higher than Trump . In a Fox News poll:


  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health; local officials got 75 per cent; state governments 74 per cent; Vice-President Mike Pence 55 per cent; and Trump 51 per cent.
  
  The federal and provincial governments in Canada are getting high marks for their handling of the crisis, with approval ratings mainly in the 60s...France's unpopular president, Emmanuel Macron, has gotten a bounce, with polls showing him gaining as much as 14 per cent during the crisis. Italy's governing party is polling better, too.


A high approval in a crisis does not mean re-election.


  Take George H.W. Bush, who had an approval rating around 90 per cent after winning the first Gulf War in 1991 but lost re-election the following year. A soft economy quickly pulled his Gallup approval down as low as 29 per cent.

"The WHO was against travel restrictions as they detailed in a press release at the end of February. But in the month past (March) practically every country on earth has instituted travel restrictions, most recently China, which is now afraid of being reinfected from abroad.

So, has the WHO changed their public stance in any way about travel restrictions by now? I searched a bit, but it seems they've gone mum on the topic of travel, while (of course) strongly advocating for social distancing in general. (Aside: the WHO wants us to use ""physical distancing"" as the more appropriate term for that.)

I haven't done anything like a survey on this, but clearly some governments include ""minimize travel"" in the physical distantincing advice they give, e.g. Australia's 


  Government advice for implementing physical distancing has mainly urged people to isolate themselves in space: staying at least 1.5 metres apart, working from home, avoiding gatherings, and minimising travel.


So maybe the WHO has done the same somewhere in their recommendations and I've missed it.

Likewise, there have been at least three (high-profile) publications in Science this month on this:


March 6


  the travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in Mainland China, but has a more marked effect at the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.

March 25


  It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.

March 31


  The Wuhan shutdown was associated with the delayed arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days (95%CI: 2.54-3.29). [...] This analysis provided no evidence that the prohibition of travel between cities, which was implemented after and in addition to the Wuhan shutdown on 23 January, reduced the number of cases in other cities across China. These results are robust to the choice of statistical regression model. [It also analyzes, and finds effective (via association), most city-level social-distancing measures:] Our model suggests that, without the Wuhan travel ban or the national emergency response, there would have been 744,000 (± 156,000) confirmed COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan by 19 February, day 50 of the epidemic. With the Wuhan travel ban alone, this number would have decreased to 202,000 (± 10,000) cases. With the national emergency response alone (without the Wuhan travel ban), the number of cases would have decreased to 199,000 (± 8500). Thus, neither of these interventions would, on their own, have reversed the rise in incidence by 19 February. But together and interactively, these control measures offer an explanation of why the rise in incidence was halted and reversed, limiting the number of confirmed cases reported to 29,839 (fitted model estimate 28,000 ± 1400 cases), 96% fewer than expected in the absence of interventions.



So maybe there's a ""wind of change"" in the scientific community on this, maybe not, but perhaps it's too early to tell what the consensus might become on this. So I'm ""holding off"" on accepting the answer below for now (based on a non-mention in a March 11 WHO statement) as rather inconclusive.
","The WHO released a joined statement with the ICAO ([on the WHO website it's dated 11 March 2020). It does not mention travel restrictions directly. It does, however, stress cooperation at different levels, for example between ""aviation and health authorities"". 

My interpretation is that the WHO is leaving such restrictions up to the states, at least in their public statements. 
"
"In wealthy first-world countries, although social distancing hurts on a social and economic basis, it is at least feasible for a certain time. Basically every country world-wide has now implemented such measures. 

Reports from outside the first-world, however, make it seem like this is a much more challenging policy to implement. Police in South Africa are firing rubber bullets at shoppers who are violating lockdown and in India there are literally millions on the march home despite the country's lockdown order. Staying at home and keeping distance is impossible in slums with huts and no running water. Furthermore, poor people also much less able to survive a period without income and poorer countries are less able to provide them with support during this period.

Is there good evidence whether or not current lockdown/social distancing measures are sustainable in poorer third-world countries? If not, are there any other options for such countries to fight global pandemic that can be sustained and enforced?  
","In many ""poorer non-first world countries"" it's going to be very challenging. People often need to work every day in order to ""eat"" the next day, which prohibits social distancing measures. They have a problem with the availability of sanitation - for hand cleaning. The density of the population in some of these countries is also very significant, which can provide an additional risk factor for a greater spread of the virus.

From past epidemics for example in sub-Saharan Africa, they needed a lot of mostly international humanitarian help. Medical systems in poor countries usually have little capacity to deal with a huge number of cases. They also don't have a way for effective testing for the virus, laboratories... The question is to what extent can humanitarian help be made available.  

""Rich countries"" and international organizations providing governance, medicine, and other resources are currently in the core of epidemics themselves. This crisis is also economically challenging, which adds prohibitive cost to invest in humanitarian help for poorer countries. IMF is currently planning to lend around $1trn to developing countries, and hopefully, G20 will also provide at least some humanitarian capacity to help them. From a political point of perspective, China can use this as an opportunity to extend its influence over developing economies requiring help with fighting Covid virus.

Prohibitive measures could also be used by some of the political regimes to tighten their grip on power which could lead to destabilization.

On the other hand for example in India, you have a huge pharmaceutical sector which makes medicine, which can help in providing antibiotics or other types of medicine which could be beneficial for sick people.

The virus could also be weakened by a warm climate, which is not yet scientifically proven. Population structure in poor countries is usually much younger, which is another benefit, although people can be malnourished and have different medical problems which could make things worse if they were to become infected by Coronavirus.

"Why have some governments banned outbound international flights in response to COVID-19?

For example, the Philippines initially announced (but later reversed) a ban on outbound flights:


  Airports in Luzon [large island in Philippines where the capital, Manila, is located] will stop all outbound international flights starting Friday after the government gave a 72-hour window to all those who wish to leave the country after heightened measures were put in place to control the spread of COVID-19.
  
  https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/3/17/Philippines-international-flights-coronavirus-Luzon-quarantine.html


The New York Times has an article on travel bans that identifies a few other cases of countries with outbound travel bans, including:


Namibia: ""suspending inbound and outbound flights from Qatar, Ethiopia and Germany for 30 days""
Bolivia: ""cessation of all flights to and from Europe""
Peru: ""The measure means all international flights will be canceled. ""


I understand the ban of inbound international flights to prevent contaminated individuals from entering the country, but banning outbound flights seems less obvious to me.
","Another possibility, ignoring fears of infection, is that the country doesn't want their citizens to become stranded in another country if flights are suspended at a later date. For example, on Monday, March 30th, the UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced a £75m plan to charter flights to repatriate stranded Britons, and also advised any citizens still in countries where commercial flights remain available to fly home as soon as possible.

If a country's citizens become stranded abroad it will usually end up being the government's responsibility to fly them home.

"It is generally assumed that an FDA approval is conditioned on the demonstrated safety and effectiveness of a product. However, when the FDA authorizes the use of a product due to an emergency condition, does that mean that there is no requirement to demonstrate safety and effectiveness?

Presumably the FDA has some regulatory threshold between ""not proven safe"" and ""proven safe"" where it issues emergency use authorizations. So, to what degree are safety standards relaxed when an FDA Emergency Use Authorization is used in lieu of a standard FDA approval?

Second question: while it is obviously that the relaxation of standards is influenced by the severity of the emergency, but does that relaxation threshold also vary with political and or corporate pressures? 
","Looking on the FDA website, I found this: 

Notice of Declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for medical countermeasures against COVID-19

In brief, it lays out that the Secretary of Health and Human Services is offering limited immunity from lawsuits and prosecution — at his considered discretion — for medicines and equipment to be used against the Covid-19 pandemic. It allows approved equipment and medicines to be used in 'off-label' or unapproved ways, and allows drugs that are being researched under 'investigative' exemptions, or even drugs or products that the Secretary decides could reasonably be on the market within 10 years (meaning drugs that are early in development, and not yet thoroughly tested). The FDA is still holding the reigns — it has the final say in determining that a drug or device is at least marginally safe — but it is setting aside the exhaustive testing and approval processes it normally requires before allowing general use.

Section IV to VI spell out what is and is not covered by this immunity during the Crisis, but it seems the standard being used is that the drug or device has a credible purpose in dealing with some aspect of Covid-19 and is not grossly or flagrantly irresponsible to use.

"It is widely considered that the passing of the corona virus bill in Hungary is a huge step towards dictatorship. (See, for example, here: https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-viktor-orban-rule-by-decree/)

The main argument is that:


The bill allows prime minister Orban to rule by decree infinitely (at least as long as he sees fit) and that
There is no real need for these measures even during the current COVID-19 pandemic.


But what remains is the question whether there is any need for such measures. From my view as a outsider, I can't really see any benefits concerning the fight against the pandemic. Fidesz already has a two-third majority in parliament, enabling it to rule mostly unhindered and is even  able to change the constitution if deemed necessary. Any (tough) measures could probably be passed easily by Fidesz without Orbán having to be able to rule by decree.

Of course, if someone would like to transform the country into a dictatorship, these measures would make a lot of sense. But are there other reasons that may justify the necessity of the bill?
","Well, one obvious justification is that it means the parliament does not have to assemble. 


It is difficult to organize a parliamentary debate while keeping social distancing.
What if some legislators get into contact with an infected person. Could they still speak and cast their vote, or would they be banned during the quarantine period?


Of course the parliament could e.g. have put a narrow expiry date on the rules, but who knows how feasible a session would be three or six months from now? An expiry of ""after the pandemic"" would be too fuzzy. 



My personal opinion is that the parliament should have found a way to stay relevant, but the question asked for possible justifications.

An option might have been to change parliamentary rules to reduce the quorum, possibly combined with pairing, or to allow online debates and voting, but those are difficult for democracy as well.
"
"Decision on how long to keep the economy ""shut down"" depends on the evaluation of how deadly/infectious coronavirus is. 

So I would assume that countries would try to test random members of ""healthy""(no sign of illness) population to determine the spread in the population.

I assume this was not done because tests are in high demand for people that exhibit symptoms, but could not find any confirmation for my thesis.

There is this question from 3 weeks ago, but from what I understand no answer claims there is a generalized sampling.
","This may seem counterintuitive, but constructing and administering a properly random testing paradigm is difficult and time-consuming. It's not as though we can gather everyone in a big room, put their names in a hat, and then call them out one-by-one to get tested. There are a number of different issues that need to be resolved, e.g.:


People are not randomly distributed. In the real world they cluster by race, religion, economic status, political affiliation, occupation, and other demographic factors. A purely random sample (unless it's immense) will likely underrepresent or overrepresent specific populations.
People are not easy to find. Say that Joe Smith is someone randomly chosen to be tested. What if we can't reach him by phone or email? What if we send a testing kit to him and he neglects to return it, or uses the kit incorrectly? What if we send a 'swabber' to his house, only to find he isn't home, or refuses to open the door? Depending on methodology, sampling in this context can have massive non-participation, and the more non-participants we see, the weaker our statistical results are.
People are not infected entirely randomly. Infections are a Markov chain, where one must be in specific kinds of contact with an infected person to have a chance of being infected, and then (if infected) must be in the same specific kinds of contact with uninfected people to pass it on. Modeling a Markov chain as though it were purely random misses important aspects of the way a disease is spread, and will skew results badly.
Perhaps most importantly, the spread of a pandemic is a fluid situation, not a stable characteristic of individuals. Collecting physical samples from people requires a tremendous amount of time and labor (driving to a home and collecting a sample, driving to another home and collecting a sample, repeat, repeat, drive back to homes where people were absent and try again). Even if we could muster a veritable army of 'swabbers' for our random sampling of nearly 400 million people, we can expect the actually swabbing to take at least a week (generously), and in a week the number of infections has doubled and doubled again. The first people swabbed are not being drawn from the same statistical population as the last people swabbed, and our statistics will suffer. And then we have to ask about our swabbers, who are all part of the population we are sampling, and all of whom have been exposed to large numbers of potentially infected people...


The upshot is that if we were to take the time to properly construct and implement a large-scale random sample, the disease would be spreading while we were designing the methodology, the disease would be spreading while we were implementing the testing, and by the time we finished running the data we collected the disease would have spread further, making our results all but useless. I'm not saying they would be entirely useless — with appropriate statistical manipulations we can account for many of these issues — but whatever use it has will be for future epidemiologists looking back on this pandemic.

"FactCheck.org considers Trumps claim that he inherited a broken CDC system to be 'misleading', and has given a long description of why they  made that ruling.  It effectively boils down to the claim that the CDC was never intended to be the sole producer of tests.  Instead they claim that the CDC was always intended to work with third parties and private sector to support the production of tests and other resources if a pandemic happened, and that the delays with testing was due to the CDC not allowing private sector agencies to build tests originally.

If it's true that the intent of the CDC was to support/regulate private sector test development, and that the CDC failed to do that, then the next question is why didn't it?  Why did the CDC not immediately open up production of tests to the private sector and support and vet those tests as factcheck.org claims was the original design intent?

Is there a specific individual or group of individuals who had the ability to decide to open up testing to private sector and failed to do it?  Was Trump or the white house in any way responsible for this decision to not open up testing to the private sector?
","Shorter answer: The Departments of the CDC, FDA, and HHS all are under the direction and guidance of the Trump administration. Failures of any one of these departments is the direct responsibility of the President. Parsing which department is most responsible for failure to immediately mobilize and deploy mass testing, while interesting, is an exercise in searching for a scapegoat.

"Currently farmers in Western countries are warning governments that without foreign workers their fields will be impossible to harvest:


  “We are in need of a lot of foreign workers,” Eystein Ruud, a greenhouse farm owner and chairman of the Norwegian Horticultural Association, told The Globe and Mail. “If we cannot get these workers in the coming weeks, our farmers won’t risk putting a lot of plants in the soil. That may affect the food supply.”


At the same time Western nations are about to face unprecedented levels of unemployment due to the COVID-related shutdowns. On the face of it, this seems like a perfect match - people who lost their jobs could now work their local fields, earning a salary and supplying much needed food for the nation. So why is this considered a problem, rather than a blessing in disguise? Shouldn't governments be happy they have job openings for the unemployed?

I do understand that working the fields is difficult and only young people could do it, but currently a lot of young people lack a job too, so that looks like a manageable problem.
","I think these countries are in fact approaching this as a problem that has an obvious solution, as you suggest. The issue lies, however, with convincing their populace to work these seasonal jobs, and the inherent nature of seasonal agricultural work.

Firstly, the levels of unemployment are not necessarily going to be as bad as you might think, at least in some countries. Many western countries, including Norway, which you mention, and later, the UK, have implemented schemes which will allow companies to keep employees who have been furloughed due to the crisis on the payroll by covering a large portion of their wages. These schemes don't stop claimants from taking another job, at least in the UK's case, but potentially reduce the need for them to do so.

Secondly, the nature of this work means that for this to be a long-term job choice, workers need to be flexible and able to travel around the country. The BBC points out that 


  One reason overseas workers are recruited for these picking roles is
  that farmers require temporary, flexible workers who will move around
  the country following the crops.
  It is often difficult for local people to fill these roles as they are
  extremely busy for a short space of time - for example, two months to
  pick apples - with no work for the rest of the year.


So while it might be easy to find workers in one area of the country, it is currently infeasible given the COVID-19 crisis for workers to travel around the country as previously. Therefore, a much larger number of local workers need to be found in order to meet with local demand, rather than smaller groups of seasonal workers meeting the demand nationally.

Additionally, western Europeans are unused to this sort of work. According to the Independent:


  It's fair to say that British workers have turned their noses up at
  seasonal farm work in recent years, perhaps partly due to the
  availability of other, more secure jobs in more comfortable
  surroundings.
  
  ""It's hard work and the Eastern Europeans are experienced at what they
  do,"" says Oliver Shooter, owner of AE Lenton, which runs a group of
  farms between Skegness and Boston in Lincolnshire, the centre of
  England's vegetable production.
  
  ""It's not rocket science but it is quite a skilled job that these guys
  do,"" he says. A top picker needs to know and apply supermarkets'
  exacting standards for exactly how fruit and veg must look, as well as
  how to cut it and pack it. For that they'll earn £12 an hour if
  they're good. Many farms also provide free or subsidised
  accommodation.


The seasonal workers that farms usually rely on, that know their trade and are experienced are unable to be used, so farmers are again being forced to engage a larger workforce than normal, in order to achieve a similar standard of work. This will, of course, entail higher costs, a longer training period, and presumably, a lower yield as mistakes are made.

Governments are trying to deal with this problem by pushing the solution you suggest - the Independent reports again:


  So acute is the need that the government is reportedly readying its
  own ""Pick for Britain"" campaign taking inspiration from the Land Army
  that tilled the fields during the Second World War.


In Norway, the government has introduced a scheme which will encourage employees laid off by their employer to work in agricultural roles:


  New legislation means that if a worker is laid off and takes up an
  agricultural role, he or she will be able to earn both a salary from
  the farmer as well as half his or her unemployment benefit.


It's not so much that the solution to the problem isn't obvious, it's that due to a combination of the nature of seasonal agricultural work, and the complications introduced by the current crisis, the problem is harder to solve than at first glance.
"
"Romania has virtually the worst public health system in EU and there is no surprise that it is far from being prepared for tackling the coronavirus infection.

On major issue is that corruption (e.g. among hospital managers) has led to hospitals to not have the minimum equipment (masks, gloves) not even for a week or two. 

In this context lots of medical workers got infected and quite a lot decided to quit. The government wants to tackle this issue by either withdrawing their right to practice medicine or expanding their notice period.

Since Romania already has a significant medical staff deficit, the second option is more likely. Currently the law mentions a 20 working days period notice (~ 1 month), but the government is considering 60 working days (~ 3 months). Based on some epidemic spreading simulations this will cover the worst period of the epidemics. This means de facto forcing the medical staff to face the infection without proper equipment.

Working without proper equipment means a much higher chance of getting infected, infecting colleagues and patients.

There was a lot of debate over this issue and I am wondering if such measures are compatible with EU laws or the emergency sate can simply override some EU laws that have priority over national laws. 

Question: Can an EU country government force its medical doctors work with SARS-CoV2 infected patients without the proper equipment?

Note: Some equipment was indeed received very recently, a few weeks after the first coronavirus case was officially confirmed in Romania.
","The EU directives and regulations with respect to ""Workplaces, equipment, signs and personal protective equipment"" can be found here. The directive that I think is most relevant is Directive 89/656/EEC - use of personal protective equipment.

This directive sets minimum standards for PPE used by workers, and states the obligations that employers have on this matter:


  Personal protective equipment must be used when the risks cannot be
  avoided or sufficiently limited by technical means of collective
  protection or procedures of work organization.
  
  All personal protective equipment must:
  
  
  be appropriate for the risks involved, without itself leading to any increased risk
  correspond to existing conditions at the workplace
  take account of ergonomic requirements and the worker's state of health
  fit the wearer correctly after any necessary adjustment.
  
  
  The employer must provide the appropriate equipment free of charge and
  must ensure that it is in good working order and hygienic condition.


When defining what this directive covers, the following exceptions are noted:


  The definition in paragraph 1 excludes:
  
  (a) ordinary working clothes and uniforms not specifically designed to
  protect the safety and health of the worker;
  
  (b) equipment used by emergency and rescue services;
  
  (c) personal protective equipment worn or used by the military, the
  police and other public order agencies;
  
  (d) personal protective equipment for means of road transport;
  
  (e) sports equipment;
  
  (f) self-defence or deterrent equipment;
  
  (g) portable devices for detecting and signalling risks and nuisances.


None of these exceptions would seem to cover medical workers except the rather non-specific ""emergency and rescue services"". I would take that to mean paramedics, ambulance staff, and mountain rescue workers and the like, however it is possible that this clause could be used to exempt general medical workers from this protection.

Specifically in the case of Romania, this directive has been implemented in national law by ""Hotărâre privind cerinţele minime de securitate şi sănătate pentru utilizarea de către lucrători a echipamentelor individuale de protecţie la locul de muncă"", or ""Decision concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use by workers of personal protective equipment at the workplace"". From my rudimentary translation of the law, this appears to be pretty much word for word a translation of the original directive.

At first glance then, it seems that failing to provide adequate PPE for hospital staff is a breach of the employer's obligations under this EU directive. However, there are a number of exceptions noted in the directive, not to mention exceptions in national law, which could be used to exclude hospital workers from the protection. In addition, a few national governments have not implemented the directive into national law yet. This makes it difficult to give a definitive answer before this is tested in the courts, as a Spanish doctor's union is attempting.

"CONTEXT

While no government wants there to be a pandemic, and would certainly prefer (hope) for it to just go away, they can only downplay it for a short time before it overwhelms the population and they must address it from a significantly weaker position than if they had acted decisively at the beginning.

In the smartphone era, information propagates instantly through informal networks (Facebook, WeChat, StackExchange, etc.) and is difficult to suppress.

QUESTIONS

After witnessing the COVID epidemic and failure to contain it in Asia, it spread to Europe and was poised to infect the west. Why did western hemisphere leaders downplay the pandemic’s threat instead of acknowledging the problem and communicating what would be done to reverse the issue?  What is the political incentive for deferring acknowledgement and action?
","In hindsight it's clear that many governments should have taken the risk of a Covid19 pandemic much more seriously, but it's not that easy to anticipate the reach and intensity of the epidemic before it happens. There have been other serious threats before for which the containment strategy proved sufficient, and if a government allocates resources (for instance massive purchases of masks and ventilators) which end up wasted they are going to be criticized as well. 

This article in the Guardian argues that most European countries were not as well prepared as some Asian countries because:


There was no recent experience of a serious epidemic in the country,
causing leaders to subconsciously underestimate the seriousness of
the threat.
There is a potential political cost for a government if they invest
resources by precaution and the risk doesn't materialize:


  ""The challenge faced by government is whether and when to act on a health threat. If you act swiftly and the outbreak isn’t as bad as
  feared, then government gets criticised for overreacting. If you
  adopt a wait-and-see approach and move too slowly, then government
  gets criticised for underreacting,"" says Steve Taylor, professor at
  the University of British Columbia and author of The Psychology of
  Pandemics.


As an example, during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic
Roselyne Bachelot was Minister of Health in the French
government. She purchased 94 million vaccines, but only a small
proportion turned out to be actually used. As a result she was
widely criticized for wasting public money. I assume that there are
other examples of this kind, where a politician loses some political
points because they made a safe but costly decision.


It seems that when an epidemic threat presents itself a government must make a call between:


Taking the threat seriously and therefore mobilizing important resources for an overall unlikely epidemic crisis, with a high risk to appear as overreacting and wasting public money.
Taking minimal conservative measures, which is unlikely to be sufficient if the crisis materializes. However this will likely appear as the ""normal"" choice to make, since nobody could objectively have anticipated the intensity of the crisis.


Note: this answer is made of recycled material from a closed question of mine.
"
"I have heard about the saying “It’s the economy stupid”, but I’m not sure about how true it is now. 

Let’s use Trump’s approval as an example. Even though there is a “rally around the flag effect” that is typical of leaders during crises (it is a lot smaller than governors and foreign leaders and especially President Bush in 2001), it does show that despite the stock market crashing, his approval continued to rise before presumably hitting a ceiling of about 46% on 538. For more context, in the years before, at 538, his approval was hovering at around 43% despite a relatively strong economy. 

I have read that the economy is not affecting people’s voting habits nearly as much as it used to. Is that true?
","Firstly, to address the example of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its effect on the popularity of Donald Trump; the level of correlation between the performance of the economy and US presidential popularity is well studied. For example, LSE research in 2013 found that presidential approval is highly sensitive to changes in the share index:


  A positive change in the index, when controlling for other relevant
  factors, on average produces an increase in the President’s approval. 
  Interestingly, the effect is even more pronounced when we look at
  market acceleration or deceleration. When the market is growing at an
  increasing rate, voters reward the president, but when growth is
  decelerating, the president is punished.


You are right that President Trump's current opinion polls would seem to buck this trend, as the stock market has plummeted, with the Dow Jones crashing around 8000 points since the end of February, while the President enjoys record high approval ratings of 49% according to Gallup. However, I would argue that instead of an indication that these two measures are no longer intrinsically linked, they are rather an exception to the rule, precedent for which already exists.

We can, for example, consider the performance of the stock market in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, with the NYSE and the Nasdaq closing for almost a week, the Dow Jones falling 14%, and the NYSE market falling by 7.1%, a record at the time. Clearly in normal times, this would have led to a dramatic fall in presidential approval. However, as you note in your question, President Bush's approval rating soared to around 90%, the highest ever for a US president, and would go on to gradually lower over his tenure as President.

Another example might be the Gulf War in 1991. Although this took place in the middle of a recession, which had lowered the approval of President Bush Snr., his victory in the crisis gave him record approval ratings. This lead was, however, squandered over the next year, as Gallup puts it: ""Americans' attention shifted from the Persian Gulf to the struggling U.S. economy"". He would, of course, go on to lose the 1992 election to Bill Clinton.

It seems, therefore, that rather than this incongruency representing a break from the established conventional wisdom that presidential approval, and as a result, US political outcomes, mirrors the stock market, it is at least at the moment a reflection of previous examples of the 'rally around the flag' effect that you note in your question. Whether or not Trump's approval rating continues to stay at this high level will depend on how his response to the crisis is judged by the American public.

Secondly, to evaluate the scope of your question more generally, there is a growing body of research which seems to support your notion that the aforementioned link between the performance of the economy and the electoral outcomes of incumbent politicians is becoming weaker, at least in the US. 

For example, the NYT conducted a survey (notably before the current pandemic) weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States, in which public opinion regarding Trump's handling of the economy was tested. The full results can be found here. Their analysis suggests that:


  Economic conditions have historically been among the best predictors
  of presidential elections, and models based on those patterns suggest
  that Mr. Trump would be favored to win re-election if the economy
  remains more or less on its current path through Election Day. But it
  is unclear whether historical lessons hold in an era of heightened
  partisanship.


In particular, SurveyMonkey, who conducted the poll, note that


  When asked which political party in general does a better job handling
  the economy, the public is locked in a 45-45 deadlock. Republicans
  overwhelmingly (95%) favor the Republican party, while Democrats
  overwhelmingly (88%) favor the Democratic party. Independents are
  split, with 39% favoring the Democrats and 36% favoring the
  Republicans.


It would seem according to this research, that although ""Jobs and the economy"" remains the most important issue for the largest proportion (24%) of the survey participants, their other partisan beliefs are unlikely to shake their party loyalty in the wake of a change in economic fortunes.

In addition, 538 has a great article on this, which I won't go into too much detail on because this answer is already pretty long, but in particular, Silver notes that:


  In particular, we don’t have enough data to make overly specific
  claims about the economy. That is, any time you see what you might
  call a “magic bullet” claim, such as that second-quarter GDP is
  crucial or that per-capita disposable income is the key economic
  variable, you should be wary.


Although he also echoes the misgivings of the NYT article, that partisanship could dull the response to a recession, he maintains that the performance of the economy is still very important to the outcome for the incumbent party - ""The better off America is by November, the more likely he is to be re-elected.""

In conclusion, then, although there is evidence to suggest that the conventional link between the economy and the fate of incumbent officials is weakening due to increased polarization and partisanship, the link is still undeniably extant. While in this specific case around the COVID-19 pandemic the incongruency can perhaps be explained by the 'rally 'round the flag' effect, it seems likely that the ultimate fate of Trump's 2020 campaign will be defined by his response to the pandemic and the underlying economical issues over the coming months. It is still far too early, in my opinion, to write off our conventional knowledge based on a few opinion polls conducted during a crisis.

"Everyone agrees that COVID-19 did not originate in India and came from international travellers. Why didn't India ban incoming flights in early Feb 2020 till the virus problem is over ? Is there any international travel rule which prohibits a country from refusing entry to its own citizens?
","
  Is there any international travel rule which prohibits a country from refusing entry to its own citizens?


Yes.


  The Right of return  is a principle in international law which guarantees everyone's right of voluntary return to or re-enter their country of origin or of citizenship. 
  
  The right is formulated in several modern treaties and conventions, most notably in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 1948 Fourth Geneva Convention. The Geneva Conventions, it has been argued, have passed into customary international law and that the right of return is binding on non-signatories to the conventions




The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights says


  Article 13.
  
  (1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.
  (2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.

"Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic Senator from Massachusetts, is generally considered a top contender to be Joe Biden's running mate. If she was elected Vice President, she would have to resign her seat in the Senate. How would her replacement be chosen?

While I know the governor names an initial replacement, followed by a special election, but what determines the timing of this? Can the governor's decision be overruled by the legislature? 
","The ""official"" rule is


  [A special election] 145-160 days after vacancy occurs. If a vacancy occurs after April 10 but on or before the 70th day before the regular state primary, the office shall appear on the regular state primary ballot. If a vacancy occurs after that time, the office shall appear on the state election ballot that November.
  
  [...]
  
  In Massachusetts a bill was passed in response to the death of Senator Edward Kennedy and his request that the current law be changed.  Previous law in Massachusetts called for a special election to be held, but not until five months after the vacancy occurs.  The new law retains the special election, but permits the governor to appoint a temporary successor in the interim.


https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vacancies-in-the-united-states-senate.aspx

In 2004, to prevent the Republican Governor from appointing a Republican, the Democrat legislature passed laws which mandated a special election.  However in 2009, when Ted Kennedy died, there was a desire that the post should be filled promptly, and the law was amended so that the Governor could make an interim appointment.

The timings are further complicated by the postponement of elections due to COVID-19 restrictions.  However it seems reasonably clear that 


The Governor can only appoint an interim senator.
The Governor cannot be overruled by the legislature, but the legislature can amend the law before the Governor makes their choice.
The timing of the special election is about 5 months after the post falls vacant.

"
"As reported on the BBC today:


  The [US] president accused the WHO of being ""very China-centric"" and said they ""really blew"" their pandemic response.
  
  Dr Tedros has now dismissed the comments, insisting: ""We are close to every nation, we are colour-blind.""
  
  After first attacking the WHO on Tuesday, President Trump renewed his criticism at his press briefing on Wednesday, saying the organization must ""get its priorities right"". He said the US would conduct a study to decide whether the US would continue paying contributions [...]
  
  On Tuesday, President Trump had said the WHO appeared to be ""very biased toward China"".
  
  ""They called it wrong. They really - they missed the call,"" he said. ""And we're going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO. We're going to put a very powerful hold on it, and we're going to see.""


Clearly (from the same article) Tedros has rejected the notion that the WHO has a China-bias, but have they said anything more specifically rejecting the other accusations, i.e. that they ""really blew"" their response and that they ""missed the call"" (when the pandemic started)?

Similarly,


  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Trump, vowed there would not be any funding for the WHO in the next Senate appropriations bill.
  
  ""I'm in charge of the appropriations subcommittee. I'm not going to support funding the WHO under its current leadership. They've been deceptive, they've been slow, and they've been Chinese apologists,"" Graham said in an interview with Fox News.
  
  Last week, Republican Senator Marco Rubio called for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, saying ""he allowed Beijing to use the WHO to mislead the global community"".


These latter accusations from Republican senators are even more direct and specific (than ""blew""), accusing the WHO of deliberate deception, in cahoots with Beijing, besides being ""slow"".

Thanks to @ItalianPhilosophers for finding this, Fox News has been emphasizing this bit in their coverage of the Republican-WHO spat:


  Last month, Taiwan accused the WHO of ignoring a warning it sent in December about human-to-human transmission of coronavirus. “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China,” the organization tweeted in January.


Which may be what the US Republicans are alluding to with ""slow"".

Somewhat more obvious/predictible, Fox News is critical of the WHO's criticism of the US travel ban:


  the WHO responded to Trump’s travel ban on foreign nationals coming from China by saying that “travel bans to affected areas or denial of entry to passengers coming from affected areas are usually not effective in preventing the importation” of coronavirus cases and instead could have a “have a significant economic and social impact.”
  
  Criticism of the travel ban and other pro-China statements have brought renewed questions about the U.S. funding the agency.


(The latter issue has been the topic of two separate questions here e.g., so I don't want to reash that.)

If the WHO itself has not replied to those (other) allegations of Trump/Republicans/Fox-News/Taiwan more specifically, has the WHO's record in this respect been defended by others, e.g. has the press said anything in support/defence of WHO's actions in response to the pandemic that can address some of Trump's accusations (from those quotes that I have emphasized)?
","For what's worth it, Al Jazeera quoted a third-party defence of the WHO:


  Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, said the last thing the US and the WHO need right now is this sort of a fight.
  
  ""It is a distraction from the need to focus on defeating this pandemic,"" he told Al Jazeera.
  
  ""No virus has a nationality and it is down to how the countries have handled the threat. The core information that was needed to understand this risk was available by the end of January - and it was available through the WHO. That information still is very accurate in terms of transmissibility and lethality of this disease, so that really should have been all for any country to take it seriously,"" Konyndyk said.
  
  ""In general, I think the WHO has been further ahead of the curve and understanding the risk of the virus than Trump's own administration has, so I don't think WHO is to be blamed for the US's sluggish response."" 


And also added this on their own:


  The WHO declared COVID-19 a public health emergency on January 30, nearly a month before Trump tweeted: ""The coronavirus is very much under control in the USA,"" and a full 43 days before he declared a national emergency in the US.


I'll accept a better answer in the sense that I asked in the question, i.e. if the WHO themselves explicitly defended their record/actions in response to those Republican accusations.



Similarly the Guardian has an article defending the WHO with extensive quotes from experts and among those they've quoted a WHO official too  (Lawrence Gostin):


  WHO’s total annual budget is about $2.5bn, and contributions from member states have not significantly increased over three decades.
  
  “The WHO’s budget is around the equivalent of a large US hospital, which is utterly incommensurate with its global responsibilities,” said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law professor at Georgetown University. [He also holds a WHO position, as made clear later in the article.] “So, if the US president were a global health leader, he’d be leading a call to at minimum double the WHO budget in the face of this pandemic.” [...]
  
  “I have been a longstanding critic and I’ve described their performance on Ebola as catastrophic. But I think overall their performance on this outbreak has been, not perfect, but pretty good,” Ashish Jha, a public health professor at Harvard, said.
  
  “They’ve been very transparent as much as they have known the data. They have had daily calls, they have been very clear about the severity of this illness, and how the global community has to respond.”
  
  Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Robert Redfield, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, took part in WHO conference calls about coronavirus from 7 January, according to sources familiar with the conversations.
  
  Gavin Yamey, the director of Duke University’s center for policy impact in global health, said: “If the United States had followed the WHO’s very clear advice on identifying cases, isolating cases and conducting contact tracing, then it wouldn’t be in the appalling situation that it is in today.”
  
  Despite its declaration, the WHO did not advocate travel restrictions of the sort imposed by Trump a day later on non-American travellers arriving from China. The president has pointed to this as an example of bad advice. But Gostin, who is director of the WHO centre on global health law, said that the organisation cannot generally call for travel bans under international law – and such bans can be counterproductive, leading countries to withhold vital information for fear of economic isolation.
  
  “To blame the WHO for acting on the basis of international law and science in ways that are entirely consistent with what WHO practices have been for decades is the height of hypocrisy,” he said.
  
  Trump claimed that his ban “shut down” intercontinental transmission of the virus, but an ABC television investigation found that there were 3,200 flights from China to the US in the critical period between December and March.


The Guardian article does grant the WHO critics some points on Taiwan:


  The US president’s accusations that the WHO is “China-centric” have more resonance with public health scholars. The WHO has largely excluded Taiwan from its discussions, and dodged questions about the Taiwanese response, which has been one of the most effective. But because of pressure from Beijing – which sees Taiwan as an integral part of its territory and opposes any form of recognition – the blindspot is a UN-wide phenomenon.
  
  “I think the effusive praise for China, in the early days, was probably unnecessary,” Jha said.
  
  Amanda Glassman, the executive vice-president and senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, said a deeper problem is the WHO’s low budget and relatively toothless structure. Unlike the nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, it has no redress against governments that do not cooperate.
  
  “It operates in countries at the pleasure and permission of the host country governments. So in the case of China, to be allowed to enter China, it was a negotiation to get there,” Glassman said.

"
"A January 14 WHO tweet that has been widely re-broadcast months later by the right-wing US press (e.g. NYPost, WashExam but not exclusively by them, e.g. Bloomberg opinion piece, Politico o.p.) said that:


  Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China.


The WHO is lampooned for this moment by the aforementioned media pieces, but these don't really say when the WHO came to a different conclusion regarding human-to-human transmission. So when did that happen, and what information source did the WHO use for the latter determination?
","The WHO was clearly wary that human-to-human transmission may be a factor at the beginning of January - although their initial Disease Outbreak News (DON) of January 5th entitled ""Pneumonia of unknown cause – China"" states that:


  According to the authorities, some patients were operating dealers or
  vendors in the Huanan Seafood market. Based on the preliminary
  information from the Chinese investigation team, no evidence of
  significant human-to-human transmission and no health care worker
  infections have been reported.


They also note that all patients are being isolated, and that close contacts of patients are being identified and monitored, which indicates that this avenue was being investigated.

Further advice published on 10th January also indicated that:


  From the currently available information, preliminary investigation
  suggests that there is no significant human-to-human transmission, and
  no infections among health care workers have occurred.


But again, warned that travellers should take measures such as


  
  avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections;
  frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment;
  travellers with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes
  with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).
  


According to the WHO COVID-19 Timeline's entry for January 14th:


  Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove noted in a press briefing there had been
  limited human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus (in the 41
  confirmed cases), mainly through family members, and that there was a
  risk of a possible wider outbreak. Dr. Kerkhove noted that
  human-to-human transmission would not be surprising given our
  experience with SARS, MERS and other respiratory pathogens.


After WHO officials from its China and Western Pacific regional offices conducted a brief field visit to Wuhan from the 20th-21st of Jan, the latter office published a twitter thread on January 21st stating that as a result of the increasing number of cases of the virus; ""It is now very clear [...] that there is at least some human-to-human transmission of #nCoV2019"". The thread also states that ""more information and analysis are needed on this new virus to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission and other important details"". 

Additionally, on the 21st of January, the DON for the spread of the disease in the Republic of Korea contained the phrase ""the extent of human-to-human transmission"", the first DON not to question the existence of human-to-human transmission, but rather its extent.

A more formal announcement was made by the WHO mission to China on the 22nd of January which states that:


  Data collected through detailed epidemiological investigation and
  through the deployment of the new test kit nationally suggests that
  human-to-human transmission is taking place in Wuhan. More analysis of
  the epidemiological data is needed to understand the full extent of
  human-to-human transmission. WHO stands ready to provide support to
  China to conduct further detailed analysis.


In conclusion then, while human-to-human transmission was suspected to be present from the initial WHO DON on January 5th, this was not confirmed until after data observed in the field in Wuhan by members of the WHO China &amp; Western Pacific regional offices was thought to show that human-to-human transmission was clearly a factor. These field investigations took place on the 20th-21st of January, and announcements acknowledging this conclusion were first made on the 21st.

"This article shows us that some US institutions rely on very old systems (written decades ago, which is very long in IT time perspective):


  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy says that the state is looking for
  volunteers with skills that can be used to help in the COVID-19
  coronavirus outbreak, and one of those skills is knowing your way
  around a 61-year-old programming language used on big, old, mainframe
  computers. 
  
  COBOL is an old computer programming language that was first developed
  in the 1950′s in conjunction with the Department of Defense. Today,
  most programmers prefer and use more modern languages, but there are
  pockets where old software written in COBOL remains in use,
  particularly financial applications and in large enterprises or
  government agencies.


I understand that state institutions are typically much slower that private companies when it comes to IT investments, but having such old systems seems strange. Relying on systems written so much time ago incurs lots of issues which translates to wasted time and money:


initial developments done way before modern software development frameworks were around us
it is much harder to find specialists which know the language, but also are able to adapt to such an old software development style
inability to act in a timely fashion when changes or maintenance must be performed (e.g. Coronavirus outbreak)


It makes for banks to be reluctant to rewriting their systems due to big costs and risks, since they must also make profit. But a public institution is not profit based and in theory can easier invest in modernizing their software systems.

Question: Why did some US institutions not migrate their very old software systems to use somewhat newer ones?

Note: I am not thinking about big leaps, but at least to work with languages and frameworks that are at most 20 years old, not 60 years old. 



While the main arguments are related to software development risks, I am interested in the political aspect of the ""why"", since we are talking about public institutions making the decision to partially / totally rewrite some systems. Such aspects might be related to the size of projects or quality of management in the public sector.
","It's not just US institutions, there are many countries, institutions - including banks - and companies running on ancient software and hardware.

There are multiple reasons for that:

First, from the business standpoint, replacing software costs money. Why spend money to replace something that already meets requirements? If you have software A that does what you want, already exists and is ""free"", since you already own it, and software B, which doesn't exist yet, costs years of development time, probably requires new hardware and has the associated costs for all of that, which would your boss or your (often very much non-technical) boss
's boss approve? What would a government employee with a tight budget approve? What would a politician calling for less government spending approve?

Secondly, the exact workings of the system are often lost in time. No one actually knows what the system does exactly, but it interfaces with dozens of other systems through APIs that are equally unknown, obscure or deprecated. Creating a specification for such a system that a contractor/contracted company can work with is difficult, if not impossible. There is a huge risk that the resulting system will not replicate the behavior of the old system and stuff will stop working. It might do things like round .5 up instead of rounding to even like the old system, which could cause all the bills or transactions to suddenly be off by 1 cent compared to the previous system.
In government, a broken system could mean that the unemployed might not get their benefits, the tax payers not their yearly tax payback or any number of things that will lead to an elected politician not being reelected. Politicians like being reelected, so even if they understand the technical need, which is rare anyways, they might avoid the risks for political reasons. Often there were attempts at replacing the system, which then failed and then those failures get pointed at whenever someone proposes replacing the system.

Thirdly, the old systems usually have a very bad user interface. A new system will have a shiny, new interface, sometimes because creating the old interface wouldn't even be feasible in a new application. This requires training people. People that have worked in the company or institution for 40-50 years and are very set in their ways. Those people often have a lot of blocking power, which can completely halt development on the new system, because their requirements, i.e. ""don't change anything,"" aren't met. They are usually also very hard to fire and replace, so the institution has to hire new people without firing them, which requires a bigger budget, which comes back to the first point.

In summary, as technical people we might understand that those systems will someday inevitably go ""poof"" and everything will break down catastrophically. Other people either don't know that it can happen, or they just hope that it will happen after their time, because in the end no one wants to pay the money, take the risk and take the blame for a project that will probably fail.

"There are numerous articles talking about how people are tired of staying in lockdown:


  As Greece enters its third week since restrictive measures were first
  imposed to combat the spread of coronavirus, there is mounting concern
  that fatigue is setting in amid signs of people beginning to flout the
  policies.
  
  Speaking to ANT1 TV, the government spokesman Stelios Petsas said the
  centre-right administration was now considering placing a time limit
  on the movement of citizens outdoors, the Guardian reports.


Are there any polls which attempt to track how much people are content with staying under lockdown?
","The day after lockdown measures were implemented in the UK, YouGov conducted a poll of 2788 adults testing whether they supported or opposed the imposition of the measures.

They found that 76% of respondents strongly supported the measures, 17% somewhat supported them, and only a combined 4% opposed them in any way.

Just over two weeks later, on April 9th, they conducted another poll which asked respondents whether they would support or oppose lockdown restrictions being extended further than the initial three week period.

It found that while strength of support may have dropped slightly, the public was still overwhelmingly in favour of an extended lockdown, and that any drop in support was fairly negligible - combined opposition was found to be 5%, with combined support at 91%.

Indeed, YouGov has also found that at least in one part of the UK, respondents think that the lockdown doesn't go far enough - a poll published on April 10th that surveyed adults in Wales found that a majority (53%) thought that the lockdown measures should be tightened, with only 6% thinking that the measures should be relaxed.

I think we can conclude from this that although there may be a small amount of quarantine fatigue given the slight drop in strength of support for the lockdown measures between March 24th and April 9th, the public still remains overwhelmingly content with the measures at the moment, and there is evidence that at least one constituent country of the UK may support a tightening of the lockdown measures.

"In libertarianism, each person is responsible for their own health.  Nobody is forced to take health insurance, and a hospital is not obliged to provide care to an individual who cannot pay for the bill (either by themselves, via insurance, or hoping for donations).  If you break your leg and can't pay for treatment, you don't get treatment.

How does the inherently individualistic libertarianism deal with the inherently collective threat of a contagious disease, which may become an epidemic?  If a sick individual is not treated, they may infect hundreds of others.  Quarantining the sick individual against their will goes against individual freedom.  In theory one could argue they may be liable for the medical costs of everyone they infect, but that is not helpful when people don't know who infected them and the infected individual can't afford treatment for hundreds of others.

Most countries deal with this threat by collectively paying for healthcare and drastically reducing the freedom of infected individuals, effectively putting them under house arrest or forcing them into hospital against their will.  Even the freedom of many healthy people is substantially reduced.  What alternatives does libertarianism propose to this, if any?
","While I haven't found a reference discussing the libertarian approach to pandemics more generally, I did find one about vaccines, which should be relevant enough, because it's another, related ""collective action problem"":


  Libertarianism and collective action: is there a libertarian case for mandatory vaccination?
  
  In his paper ‘A libertarian case for mandatory vaccination’, Jason Brennan argues that even libertarians, who are very averse to coercive measures, should support mandatory vaccination to combat the harmful disease outbreaks that can be caused by non-vaccination. He argues that libertarians should accept the clean hands principle, which would justify mandatory vaccination. The principle states that there is a (sometimes enforceable) moral obligation not to participate in collectively harmful activities. Once libertarians accept the principle, they will be compelled to support mandatory vaccination. In my paper, I argue that the cases Brennan uses to justify this principle are disanalogous to the case of non-vaccination and that they are not compelling to libertarians. The cases Brennan offers can be explained by a libertarian using the individual sufficiency principle: which states that if an individual’s action is sufficient to cause harm, then there is a (sometimes enforceable) moral obligation not to carry out that action. I argue that this principle is more appropriate to Brennan’s examples, and more appealing to the libertarian, than the clean hands principle. In order to get libertarians to accept the clean hands principle, I present a modified version of one of Brennan’s cases that is analogous to the case of non-vaccination. Using this case, I argue that whether the clean hands principle will justify mandatory vaccination is dependent on whether the herd immunity rate in a given population is approaching a threshold after which a collective risk of harm will be imposed onto others.


So, one could say ""libertarians disagree"" [on the exact approach] to such matters based on that discussion. (And it would not be the only thing they disagree about.)

Actually, there is an article in the Telegraph that even says:


  How can libertarians ever support mandatory quarantine and nationwide lockdowns? 
  
  Quite easily, as it happens. I can’t speak for all libertarians (who can?) but I see libertarianism as applied economics. The government should leave businesses alone unless there are demonstrable market failures and it should leave people alone unless they are doing direct harm to others.
  
  In case it is not obvious, infecting somebody with a potentially fatal virus counts as direct harm to others....


I haven't read the rest, but I'm guessing he's going to argue from externalities viewpoint... which according to other libertarians (Ryan Bourne of Cato in this case) is rapid descent on the slippery slope:


  The classic recommended government remedy for this problem is to try to calculate the marginal external costs or benefits associated with a given activity (beyond the private costs or benefits) and implement taxes or subsidies so these externalities are priced in when consumption or production decisions are made. Joseph Stiglitz’s Nobel lecture is a good description of this policy solution.
  
  Given the pervasiveness of externalities, applying this logic consistently and universally would result in an extremely intrusive government.  [...]
  
  The logic of banning or adopting prohibitively high sin taxes, in contrast, is that the optimal consumption level of anything with external costs is zero. This is an absurd principle, albeit one that is regularly espoused. It is common, for example, to hear commentators and policymakers advocate for a zero-carbon economy. The UK government’s recent announcement that it plans to ban all gas and diesel vehicles by the year 2040 is an example of a policy that will almost certainly impose net social costs on society.


So yeah, from this latter ""more"" libertarian viewpoint, how do you account for the fact that infecting others is only a probability, not a certainty?

As an intermission, it would be interesting if the ""father"" of ""paleolibertarianism"" had something concrete to say on this ([the probability] of infection [of others]), but insofar I wasn't able to find out that, but only some imperfect analogies that he made:


  Probably the most widely accepted doctrine within libertarianism is the “nonaggression” principle, which Rothbard uses as the central theme of his book. The “nonaggression” principle states that “no man or group of men may aggress against the person or
  property of anyone else” (27). Thus, slavery was considered to be intrinsically evil because it
  violated property rights, or the right of a person to be secure in themselves. Yelling “Fire!” in a
  crowded theater, Rothbard argues, should not be restricted because free speech is only a relative
  right; rather, it is criminal because it violates the private property rights of others in the theater
  (52). Essentially, he ascribes to the belief that individuals have an absolute right to be secure in
  their persons and goes on to apply it to numerous other aspects of life. Whether it be education,
  roads, courts, foreign policy, or critiquing the ever-popular Keynesian theory of economics,
  Rothbard consistently believes that the rights of the individual are incontrovertible. His beliefs
  are best summed up as follows:
  
  
    And, indeed, what is the State anyway but organized banditry? What is taxation but theft
    on a gigantic, unchecked, scale? What is war but mass murder on a scale impossible by
    private police forces? What is conscription but mass enslavement? Can anyone envision a private police force getting away with a tiny fraction of what States get away with, and
    do habitually, year after year, century after century? (293-294)
  
  
  This argument continues to be the bedrock of radical libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism, as it
  provides a consistent philosophy that can be applied across all aspects of life. Moderate
  libertarian thinkers tend to diverge from Rothbard, however, on the issue of how to implement
  these ideals. Some, like Rothbard, want sweeping change and scoff at others who argue for
  gradualism. Others, however, realize that government is needed in some limited capacity to
  retain order and that the free market has limits.


Actually Lew Rockwell interprets Rothbard for us in the present context:


  The fundamental rule for deciding whether anyone, including the government, is justified in using force to make us do something we don’t want to do is the nonaggression principle (NAP). As Murray put in in “War, Peace, and the State,” “No one may threaten or commit violence (‘aggress’) against another man’s person or property. Violence may be employed only against the man who commits such violence; that is, only defensively against the aggressive violence of another. In short, no violence may be employed against a nonaggressor.”
  
  You might at first think that you can use the NAP to justify forced quarantines against the coronavirus. Suppose someone had a deadly disease that would always spread to others if he came in contact with them. Probably the person would want to isolate himself and not infect others, but if he refused, wouldn’t the people in danger be justified in isolating him? He is a threat to others, even if he doesn’t intend to harm them. 
  
  Thinking about this case can lead us astray, and here is where Murray can help us most. In his great book The Ethics of Liberty, he says, “It is important to insist, however, that the threat of aggression be palpable, immediate, and direct, in short, that it be embodied in the initiation of an overt act. Any remote or indirect criterion—any ‘risk’ or ‘threat’—is simply an excuse for invasive action by the supposed ‘defender’ against the alleged ‘threat.’” Murray hammers home the point later in the book. He says, “Once one can use force against someone because of his ‘risky’ activities, the sky is the limit, and there is virtually no limit to aggression against the rights of others. Once permit someone’s ‘fear’ of the ‘risky’ activities of others to lead to coercive action, then any tyranny becomes justified.”
  
  When we apply what Murray says to the coronavirus situation, we can answer our question about forced quarantines. People are not threatening others with immediate death by contagion. Rather, if you have the disease, you might pass it on to others. Or you might not. What happens if someone gets the disease is also uncertain.


Bourne (whom one might peg in the less ""paleo"" camp) also comments on the Covid-19 issue as well (on Apr 6):


  the longer lockdowns go on, the more the income losses for businesses and households turn into bankruptcies and defaults, risking a depression. So economists recognise that the costs and benefits of policy will change over time. They will look for ways of maintaining low health risks but at lower economic and social cost than crude shutdowns, recognising this balance changes as the pandemic evolves.
  
  Indeed, once the transmission rate has been brought down and more people recover from the virus, the calculations could change drastically. If I were one of the last 50 people in the whole country to have not yet been infected, I would not expect a destructive national lockdown to protect me. So, clearly, there comes a point when it’s better to relax things from an economic welfare perspective. That could come much sooner than we think.


Interestingly, it still considers a/the notion of welfare to society as a whole as relevant... but in view of how much [herd] immunity there is... which  actually is quite to the similar argument from the opening quote I gave in this answer. 

And it's easy to get sucked into the myriad variation of responses to Covid-19 of US libertarian writers/personalities/politicians (thus make this answer way too long), but I'll mention here anyway that Ron Paul (who ran for president on a Libertarian Party ticket at one point), has called (April 10) for Fauci to be fired because (according to Paul) Fauci infringed on American liberties by overestimating the number of potential deaths from Covid-19.


  ""[...] they made these dire predictions so that they could go ahead and destroy peoples’ civil liberties and spend a lot of money and make up an excuse on why the stock market actually went down — all kinds of things by having this coronavirus event blown way out of proportion,” Mr. Paul said. “He should be fired,” Mr. Paul said about Dr. Fauci. [...]


Personality polemics aside, it seems that in most libertarian discourse the probability of infection (and death) needs to be considered, so it's not too different from how others approach the matter, but perhaps the probability is (subjectively?) ""tuned down"" at least in some US libertarian discourse. However, the most hardcore/paleo libertarians seem to reject that quantines could ever be justified.

"I have Trek Marlin 5, Today I broke rear hub axle. unfortunately, shops are closed nearby, because of COVID-19, I only have solid hub axle.
Is it okay to use solid axle instead of quick release?
","Yes, QR axles can be replaced at will with solid axles for all standard axle hubs. (Standard axle means a hub that can accept a generic third party axle. Many hubs are not.)

Be mindful that the common toothed type axle nuts are good at tearing up aluminum and carbon frames. Use washers and grease the threads.
"
"I own two tourers which I normally relubricate their aluminium alloy seatposts every spring with high quality grease. Due to moving to Cambridge and the coronavirus outbreak, both cycles are being kept safe 10 miles away but if I miss this lubrication will their seatposts become seized?
","No they won't. It is often enough to lubricate once when the bike was built unless it is used/kept for a very long time. Especially if the bike is kept in a dry place. It is not necessary to lube it once a year. The lube stays there and protects the interface for a long time. If you pull a bike that hasn't been used for ten years from a shed, many things could be seized but even then seizing of the seat tube is far from guaranteed. It is even unlikely if it was well conserved before the storage.

Interface of two different metals could change it due to electrochemical potentials and rusting. I assumed aluminium alloy on both sides or steel on both sides.

Just do it the next year or when you get to your bike.

"I am building my first road bike. I have been an avid biker rider for quite sometime and always thought about getting a road bike, just never got around to it.

Fast forward to now, my neighbor (pro rider) threw his Scott CR1 carbon fiber frame in the dumpster along with a MOST carbon handlebar and Cosmic wheel set.  Now that I acquired all this stuff for free, time to finally build a bike!

My point of this post is first to get some advice on ... where to start? How do I find out what is compatible to this bike from a component group, to putting everything together etc.

I know I won't be able to do everything but I know I can get pretty far then I am planning on taking it to a local guy to do a tuneup before I get her out on the road.

I want to build as tough and reliable as possible on a budget (don't want to spend a ton but want a quality bike). Let me know if anyone can help out with where to get started, also if you have parts for sale or anything or want to trade for something, I am wide open to that as well. Picture is attached, let me know what year as well if anyone knows. 

Thanks David


","
This frame is about 10 years old (the model was sold for a few years). There is a chance that there's a crack in the carbon fiber, which would be cause for concern. There are services that will perform non-destructive testing, and there are ways to perform inspections at home with somewhat less reliability, but that would be my first concern.
It looks like the bottom bracket is intact. If the bearings turn smoothly, keep them. If not, you'll want to replace them, which would probably be the most complex part of your build. It looks like this bike takes a PF86 bottom bracket (there are numerous standards).
This bike was sold with a Shimano 105 group (possibly other groups as well). 105 has good performance and good value, so you won't go wrong with that. You'll obviously need caliper brakes, not disk, but that's about the only requirement from the options that will be available to you.
It looks like it has a front derailleur braze-on, so you'll need to make sure you get a compatible derailleur.
There are a lot of other options that will be matters of personal taste. Crankarm length, chainring tooth counts, cassette tooth counts, saddle, pedals, bar tape color, etc.
This is not a marketplace or swap meet, so not a good place to find the parts you'll need.

"In light of the coronavirus outbreak centred in Wuhan, many countries have taken steps to either prevent entry or require a quarantine period for arrivals from the affected area. 

Canada relies on arrivals declaring whether or not they have been to Wuhan in the past 14 days. Yes, some people will tell the truth. But some won't. With 2019 nCoV, someone who was in Wuhan the past two weeks can just lie. 

Why don't G8 countries just assume most people will lie and prepare for worst? 
","I have not heard about any country denying entry or quarantining all travellers from affected areas. Isolation (at home) is recommended for people who have been in the area and present relevant symptoms. Refusing entry wholesale would be a hugely disruptive and largely self-defeating measure: it encourages people to lie, could spread the disease further by making potentially contagious victims stay longer in a public place — the airport — and through another international flight, would make (crucial) collaboration with airlines or affected countries a lot more difficult.

Extending it to all travellers from China (since you don't want to rely on people self-reported itinerary) would be pure madness (and there are already cases reported in Japan and the US… so you might as well shut down international air travel entirely). It also raises the question of returning nationals or third-country citizens, who cannot easily be refused entry and put back on a plane to the affected area.

Consequently, the question is not designed to catch people who try to defeat screening but to inform people who might not otherwise understand they are at risk and make sure they realize this information is relevant. It's more efficient than asking every passenger verbally and helps officials respond appropriately in situations where oral communication might be more difficult. It's also potentially a database you can come back to for contact tracing.

"Screening doesn't work — BBC reports Coronavirus: Chinese embassy in Paris finds woman who 'cheated' checks


  The woman boasted on social media that she had been suffering from a fever, but managed to reduce her symptoms with medicine. She later posted pictures showing herself dining at what she claimed was a Michelin-starred restaurant in Lyon.The embassy has now confirmed that her symptoms are under control. >The woman left Wuhan - where the new coronavrius emerged late last year - before flights were suspended, but when thermal scanning was in place. 
  
  5) Airport screening after SARS didn’t catch a single case


I don't believe Wuhan coronavirus: Travel bans for diseases like this don’t work - Vox. First, it just quotes past cases, but past performance doesn't predict future. Second, isn't obvious that lowering Wuhan people means lowering risk.  I know banning China flights won't stop every case. 
","They may do so at some point if the risk is deemed high enough (remember that WHO still doesn’t consider this as a severe enough pandemic at the international level).

However:


Why would they ban flights from all over China, when a majority of the cases are concentrated in a much, much smaller area? Remember that China is quite large. It would be akin to banning travel from all of Europe after an outbreak in a single city.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you consider that the virus has reached many places outside of China, why only ban flights from China rather than any country where there may have been any cases?
Unless all countries coordinate to completely isolate China (or whatever area is considered “infected”), then people will just travel via a third country, so the ban will be ineffective.


The difficult task of the health authorities is to balance reducing the risk that the virus spreads all over while not infringing on the freedoms to travel. They are constantly re-evaluating the risks based on the available info regarding number of cases, incubation period, ease of transmission, mortality rate, etc. It may be the case that this virus, even though new, is just no worse than the flu.

Remember that a travel ban not only could be a problem in terms of freedoms and rights of the affected people (try telling US citizens they can’t return home – the US government would be taken to court before you finished reading this sentence), but it also has a strong impact on the economy, which itself may have severe health repercussions.

There are probably millions of people who catch the flu, and thousand who die from it every year in your country (I know that is the case in mine). Do you think all travel in or out (or even within) yours should be stopped during the winter because of this?

"I am flying this week from Munich to London, and Bavaria just got the first contaminated person, who now has the Coronavirus 2019-nCoV after interacting with Chinese colleague. Two cases of the novel coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK, and the number of cases in Germany has grown. Moreover, the Coronavirus has now been declared a global health emergency by WHO.

I got a bunch of emails from SOS International and such, on what methodology I should follow to mitigate the risk of getting infected, but none of them addresses the following (hopefully extreme) hypothetical scenario:


  I go to my seat, and I suspect the person next to me (or in neighboring seats) has the Coronavirus related symptoms (high fever, short breath, etc.). How should I react, without being too paranoid? 


Go in the back to secretly communicate that to the flight attendant, and request a seat change? 



Update (Feb 2): I am now in Munich airport, and both pharmacies (before and after security check) have no typical plastic masks (sold-out). They only have some conical-sized ones. The airport does not provide masks (asked in the Information). I advise you to buy a typical plastic mask before coming to the airport.
","A cabin crewmember here.

This is different from airline to another, and country to another, but I can safely assume there are a lot of similarities when it comes to this, as most of the airlines get the instructions from local Civil Aviation Authorities and local health ministries, both authorities get the information from higher global organizations. 

The airline I work for supplied its fleet recently with a contagious disease kit, which shall be used by the cabin crew once there are signs of an infected passenger. This kit includes masks to be distributed once needed, a disinfectant liquid (the same as in hospitals) to clean surfaces around the sick passenger, gloves, etc. Also, my airline allowed its crewmembers to wear masks if they wish to on flights from/to certain destinations.

As I said, not sure if the same is being followed by other airlines. Regardless of that, you should inform the cabin crew right away, they are in this with you, they will know what to do. These days our mailboxes are being filled with health information and updates regarding this, and because we are exposed more than the average person, we really care about this.

Finally, what you should worry about is the infected people during the incubation period with no symptoms at all (this has been confirmed), they are as contagious with no way of knowing that. People with fever (a common symptom after the virus incubation period) will not be allowed to board. Therefore, it's advised that you follow basic prevention measures, such as washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth, cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, wear a mask (N-95 mask), etc.

This seems like a virus masterpiece, only the coming few days will let us know how serious this is.

"This community wiki explains the current restrictions by the United States of America on the entry of individuals who may pose a risk of transmission of the Novel Coronavirus discovered recently in Wuhan City, Hubei, People's Republic of China.
","This answer currently lists nationwide entry restrictions imposed by the United States federal (national) government. A majority of states as well as counties, municipalities, towns, and cities have imposed entry bans or automatic quarantine-upon-entry orders as well as stay-at-home orders that may prevent your intended travel. This answer cannot index all of these orders, which have slight differences, technicalities, and effective dates that must be consulted to determine if your planned travel activity is allowed under state and local law. NBC News provides a basic overview as of April 5, 2020. Additionally, travelers should be aware that their home countries consulates in the US may not be operating normally.

Under the new rules, all flights carrying at least one non-crew passenger that has been physically present anywhere in mainland China, Iran, the Schengen Area, or the Common Travel Area (UK/Ireland) within the past 14 days must land at one of the following airports:


JFK - New York, NY
ORD - Chicago, IL
SFO - San Francisco, CA
SEA - Seattle/Tacoma, WA
HNL - Honolulu, HI
LAX - Los Angeles, CA
ATL - Atlanta, GA
IAD - Washington, DC


The following airports were added February 3, 2020:


EWR - Newark, NJ
DFW - Dallas/Fort Worth, TX
DTW - Detroit, MI


The following airports were added March 14, 2020:


BOS - Boston, MA
MIA - Miami, FL


Additionally, such individuals cannot travel to the US at all unless they meet one of these exceptions:


US citizens and nationals
lawful permanent residents (green card holders)
spouses of citizens or LPRs
parents of unmarried citizens/LPRs under 21
siblings of citizens/LPRs, both unmarried and under 21
children, foster children, and adoptees of citizens/LPRs
air and sea crew members
diplomats and foreign officials
those granted exceptions by high-level officials


Upon arrival, such excepted passengers will be subject to public health screenings by US Public Health Service personnel. At a press briefing on Jan. 31, 2020 (transcript), Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced that individuals who have been to Hubei Province in the 14 days preceding entry will be sent to a 14-day quarantine, and individuals who have been to other parts of mainland China in the 14 days preceding entry will self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days at home. This is the first major federal quarantine action since the 1960s.

This action does not affect aliens (immigrants or nonimmigrants) already in the US. It does not cancel or revoke valid visas, though it temporarily prevents their use and may prevent the issuance of new visas in some cases.

Additionally, entering the US through land borders from Canada or Mexico is limited to ""essential travel"":


US citizens and permanent residents returning to the US
Travel for medical purposes
Travel to attend educational institutions
Travel to work in the US
Travel for emergency response and public health purposes
Lawful cross-border trade
Official government or diplomatic travel
US armed forces and their family returning to the US

Questions and Answers

Does this include only mainland China, or other territories as well? The 14-day rule does not apply the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau. It does apply to the disputed province of Tibet. It does not apply to Taiwan, the Republic of China, which is claimed by the People's Republic of China but is not functionally a part of that country.

Does this include British territories as well? The proclamation covering the UK excludes ""overseas territories outside of Europe"". This seems to mean that Gibraltar and the Crown Dependencies are included, but other British territories are excluded.

Do the US-Canada and US-Mexico border restrictions apply to air travel? Not at this time.

When do these restrictions take effect?


For China: February 2, 2020 at 5:00pm EST
For Iran: March 2, 2020 at 5:00pm EST
For the Schengen Area: March 13, 2020 at 11:59pm EDT.
For the Common Travel Area: March 16, 2020 at 11:59pm EDT.
Land border restrictions: March 20, 2020 at 11:59pm EDT.


Where are these regulations found? The Department of Homeland Security has a page on air travel restrictions, a fact sheet, and a list of news and updates. The CDC has a page on procedures for travelers from the affected countries.

The recent extension of restrictions to the Common Travel Area, consisting of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, was announced by US Vice President Pence at a press conference Saturday the 14th. Official regulations have yet to be promulgated.

Regulations on flights arriving in the US needing to be redirected to certain airports, published in the Federal Register:


For China: this document, with additional airports provided in this document
For Iran: this document
For the Schengen Area: this document with additional airports
For the UK and Ireland: this document


The Presidential Proclamations banning entry of certain sub-classes of these individuals:


For China: here
For Iran: here
For the Schengen Area: here
For the UK and Ireland: here


DHS has announcements for the US-Canada and US-Mexico land border restrictions, and the rules can be found in the Federal Register:


For US-Canada land border: this document
For US-Mexico land border: this document


How long will these restrictions last? The restrictions will remain in effect until further notice from the government. With respect to the entry ban specifically, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to advise the President at least every 15 days whether or not the ban should be changed or cancelled. The land border restrictions last until April 20, 11:59pm EDT.

Who made this decision, why, and what is there authority to do so? The Secretary of Homeland Security made the decision to impose new travel restrictions. The Secretary has the legal authority to designate the places at which flights inbound to the US may land for inspection. The Secretary decided that this measure was necessary to prevent serious harm to the national security.

The President has the authority to suspend the entry of aliens into the US as needed for national security. President Trump found that the federal government is incapable of monitoring all of the 14,000 daily travels between China and the US. Therefore, this rule is needed to protect the public health and safety of America.

The CDC has authority to enact quarantines under the Public Health Service Act.

What if I do not comply with these rules? If you lie to officials about your presence in China to avoid the regulations, you could face serious immigration consequences including expedited removal from the country and a permanent inadmissibility in the future. If you attempt to escape quarantine, the government may use lawful force to prevent you from doing so.

"I have booked flight KLM 4303 from Frankfurt to Beijing. All KLM flights to Beijing  have been suspended until 15 March 2020. But on my online ticket it says that my flight is operated by China Southern Airlines. Does that mean that the flight will still take place?
","Official Announcement from China Government:


  In light of the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (nCov), we
  would like to inform you that Tianhe International Airport (WUH) in
  Wuhan, Hubei Province, China is shut down to limit the possibility of
  the virus to spread to other places. As for now, other Chinese
  airports are still operating.


Due to this situation, there are a few consequences:

If you have a flight ticket from/to Wuhan: your flight is canceled until further notice. You are entitled to a full refund.

If you have a flight ticket from/to other Chinese cities: your flight is still operating, unless if there is an announcement from the airline about your flight.

If you are arriving from China: you will be subject to further screening at the destination airport as the authorities want to ensure the virus will not enter the country. Please bear the extra process for safety reasons.

You can simply check your flight status from China Southern Airlines too by putting your Booking Number or ticket number. 

It will also show the status. In addition, simply call China Southern Airlines to confirm which is the best and reliable way in this situation. 
"
"Due to the coronavirus KLM canceled all flights from China about a week ago. Naturally we are entitled to a full refund. According to European Union air passenger rights, passengers are also entitled to up to €600 Of compensation in the case of a canceled flight. However, we requested a cancellation of our tickets five days before they announced the cancellation of our flight but after it became public that China closed down Wuhan with the risk of other cities. So we wanted to leave as early as we could. KLM had given notice that they offer rebookings and cancellations at that time. 

Are we therefore also entitled to a 600€ refund Or would we have had to first give KLM the chance to offer us an earlier flight before booking a flight with another airline and canceling theirs? Or should we have waited 5 days until they cancelled the flight to be entitled to receive both the refund + compensation?

So in short, what does the compensation depend on? Also, does the corona virus qualify for the airline to waive the compensation penalty because it’s an “extraordinary circumstance” in the legal sense?

Edit: the cancellation &amp; approval of the refund claim of my ticket came into effect yesterday, 5 days after the flight would have taken place. We received no confirmation of cancellation neither for our specific request nor any warning of the airline itself that the flight was cancelled in general. This suggests that they A cancelled our tickets and therefore B didn’t consider us a passenger anymore at the time of cancellation. Still, it’s odd that they never gave us confirmation of the ticket cancellation. Just a “pending approval for refund request” state. 
","The airline did NOT cancel your flight.  They cancelled a flight that you were not booked on at the time of the cancellation.  It is as simple as this.  You were not booked on the flight, so you are due no compensation.

IF you had not already canceled your tickets, and you were still booked on the flight at the time of the cancellation, then you might have been due compensation under EU261, but it's very likely that the airline would consider an epidemic to be ""extraordinary circumstances"" which removes the need for the airline to provide compensation.

Addition to address the update to the question :
Simplistically speaking, airline bookings have two parts - a ""reservation"" which covers the booking on specific flight segments on specific days, and a ""ticket"" which basically shows that you have paid for those flights.  When you book a flight, first a reservation is created, then you pay, and then a ticket is issued.

When you cancel flights, the reservation of those flights is cancelled.  At that point, you are no longer booked on those flights, although you still potentially hold a ticket.  This will happen immediately that you ask for the flights to be cancelled, as the airline wants to be able to free up the seats so they can sell them to someone else.  No refund will be made as a part of cancelling a reservation.

At this point, you hold a ticket that states you've paid $X for, but which contains no flight segments as they have been cancelled.  Depending on the airline, the actual ticket you purchased, and any special conditions the airline might allow (such as allowing refunds during an event like an epidemic even if the ticket doesn't normally allow refunds), the value on that ticket might be lost entirely, might be only able to be used to book a future flight, or might allow a refund.

In order to actually get the refund, whoever issued the ticket (which might be the airline you were flying, another airline, or a travel agency) will need to cancel it and process the refund back to you.  This is a separate step in the process, and it could happen hours, days, or even months after the reservation was cancelled.

However none of that changes the fact that once the reservation has been updated, you were no longer booked on that flight, and thus no longer due compensation.

"I am an international student, supposed to start graduate studies this Fall in Hong Kong, mid August onwards. With the ongoing 2019 novel-CoV (Corona Virus) crisis in Hong Kong, I am getting concerned about what will happen. I have stopped applying to graduate schools since I already got my first priority offer from Hong Kong in early January. 

I realize it might be petty in light of the current events in China and the SARs to talk about my graduate studies options when people are getting infected daily in the thousands, but are there any predictions as to whether the Virus will be contained soon? Should I start looking for backups?
","Even the most cautious models right now models the virus to be contained towards the end of May.

Give that you then have a few more months until August I would say this is not so much of a worry for you if you are a normal middle age person with no prior heart or respiratory conditions and even so in August the risk should be minimal.

I am currently in the middle of it all in Mainland China, and with common sense and hygiene I am not at all worried about this virus.

Follow the recommendations, do not spend in needed time in public places etc and things are totally fine.

So keep up to date with the news but for August timeframes I would not worry to much.

"I am from Bangladesh. I recently applied for a non-immigrant type visa for entering Thailand for WordCamp Asia 2020 event. However, the event was cancelled recently for coronavirus outbreak.

Since my air ticket is non-refundable and hotel refund cost etc are too much, I thought why not to go there still and spend a week over there.

However, I am confused for the immigration procedure since I have got a non-immigrant visa under ED category, so I may not be allowed to travel after the event was cancelled.

So, do any one of you have similar experience and suggest me anything on this?
","you may travel on non-ed visa already issued.

If the [non-ed] visa itself is already issued in the passport, you will enter as normal and get 89 days + day of arrival permission to stay. Make sure to have 20k THB equivalent in cash or traveler's cheques just in case immigration asks for proof of ability to support oneself. 

Enjoy your holiday. 

Related: Will you be able to extend your permission to stay at a local immigration office??  Unlikely as you wouldnt have a school/event/etc.  to give you a reason to extend.

"I am going to Japan from Western Europe in March (by plane). I have a stop in Shanghai (~2h. long so I'll stay in airport). Due to the Coronavirus related protective measures, will I be quarantined when arriving to Japan?

UPDATE - 02-03-2020

I was able to reschedule my flights for later with no charge, so I chose another company and have direct flights now.
","No, you will not. Japan has banned entry of all foreigners who have travelled to Zhejiang and Hubei provinces within 14 days of travelling to Japan, but Shanghai, a provincial-level city, does not belong to either. You are (so far) safe.

It is, nevertheless, highly possible that Japan will soon extend this travel ban to the entirety of China. Keep updated. As a comment suggests, you are encouraged to keep an eye on the Timatic news feed, as well as the news.

Note: Take care of where is your next destination (transit or otherwise). For example, if it is Singapore and its within 14 days, Singapore will deny you transit or entry for the 2 hour you spent in China.

"I am American and my girlfriend is a Chinese citizen who lives in the US. However, we were both in China in December and January (leaving on January 2nd, 2020) in areas that were unaffected by COVID-19 at the time.

We have a trip booked to Mexico City for spring break, so should we anticipate any issues with both traveling to Mexico and returning to the US? I assume I'll be fine, but should we prepare proof that my GF will have been in the US for 2.5 months before going to Mexico (and returning)?
","I was just reading a post by a frequent traveler on a private travel forum (so unfortunately I can't link it here).  They are a US citizen (with Global Entry, Known traveler etc.) who traveled to China in early January (and returned to the US then).  When returning recently from another trip (to a different country) they were flagged and questioned by CDC about the trip to China in Jan, even though this trip was unrelated.  They were told to expect to be questioned every time they re-enter the US now until the virus threat dies down.
From their description it sounds like they were sent by CBP immigration officer to meet with someone from CDC, and then were sent back through to immigration (a matter of minutes to maybe an hour, although they don't specify) - they were able to easily proceed to connecting flights without issue.

So I would say that Yes you should both prepare to be questioned over your travel to China when re-entering the US.  Nothing to do with being Chinese citizen, more to do with the questions for anyone who has been to China recently.
"
"Due to the outbreak of nCoV-19 (Novel Coronavirus) many Countries have imposed several entry restrictions. But these are quite confusing for a lot of people. Some countries allow transit through parts of China (like Shanghai) but some restrict transit even through Hong Kong/Macau. Philippines restricted passengers coming from Taiwan too, but I think that that was later changed.

Where can one find a list of such restrictions for all the countries, ideally a source that is updated frequently

"I am going on holiday very soon and I have a mild temperature, I feel quite well and in my honest opinion, I am fit to travel. I will take my medication with me etc. I also look quite well.

I have a worry though. Can airport metal detectors/x-rays in the UK or in any airport detect temperature? If so and they want to pull me over for a check I will allow more time for airport security. 

Also, do you think they might have to test/quarantine me for coronavirus as the symptoms according to the NHS are:


  
  a cough
  a high temperature
  shortness of breath
  


I have a medium temperature and a mild cough (2 of 3 symptoms). It would be a pain and really upsetting to ruin my holiday.
","Neither the metal detectors, nor the full body scanners currently in use at UK airports are designed to measure or detect body temperature. However infrared camera systems designed to do so are fairly simple to install, and are known to be installed at various airports worldwide to catch fever sufferers. On a far simpler level the same kind of non-contact technology is also being used  in handheld thermometers.

At the moment this is primarily targeted at travellers from the highest-risk areas (i.e. mainland China). Since known cases in the UK are still extremely rare, it's likely you would be recognised as having a high probability of having some other virus (they are rather common after all). Having said that, the situation is subject to change, so keep following the news, and consider the worries of your fellow passengers (e.g. carry tissues &amp; hand sanitizer)
"
"We're traveling to Roma this Monday and we're kinda scared with what is happening in the North of Italy with the coronavirus.

A lot of news on the internet say that it's not advised but I feel like they're making a big deal of it and there's nothing to worry

Should we stay or can we travel there safely?
","The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the US government's public health agency, currently gives the following advice about travel to Italy:


  Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel—Widespread Community Transmission
  
  CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Italy. There is limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.  ... If you must travel:
  
  
  Avoid contact with sick people.
  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
  Clean your hands often by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at 60%–95% alcohol. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.
  
  
  It is especially important to clean hands after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.
  Supplies of hand sanitizer, tissues, and other hygiene products may be limited, so consider bringing them with you.
  
  Pay attention to your health during travel and for 14 days after you leave.
  


It is probably advisable to postpone travel to Italy at this time.

Note that this advice is comparable to the ""Level 3"" advice for China and South Korea.  For those countries, the CDC recommends that everyone avoid all nonessential travel.

"I need to cancel or possibly change an international flight on United with a non-refundable ticket (class T). When I log in to the app and hit cancel, the credit shown is the exact amount I paid for the ticket - $953. Within the credit box, it says ""change fees may apply,"" but doesn't show any sort of deduction. I've read online they can charge up to $400 in change fees.

I'm scared to hit the confirmation button. Will I get back a full credit of $953? Thanks!
","United Airlines uses a ""New Money"" concept for change fees.

Basically this means that you can cancel your flight at this time and receive a $953 credit voucher.  However in order to use that voucher at a later stage you will need to pay $400 ""new money"" (ie, the $400 can't come out of the voucher value), and then you'll be able to use the full $953 value of the credit.

Depending on when the trip is, you may want to wait until it's a little closer to the date to see if they add Rome to their waiver list for areas affected by the Coronavirus. If they do that you will likely be able to (at least) avoid paying the change fee.  The refund amount/change fee won't change over time, so as long as you cancel at least a day or two before the flight there's no reason not to wait.

"Some news reports suggested Czech Republic stopped issuing visa to Chinese citizens/nationals and closed visa centres in China after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.

The latter is of course understandable. But are all Chinese nationals, regardless of travel history/place of residence, affected by this?


https://news.expats.cz/weekly-czech-news/the-czech-republic-has-stopped-issuing-visas-to-chinese-citizens-over-coronavirus-fears/
https://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/coronavirus-czechs-suspend-visas-for-chinese-citizens-flight-ban-considered

","From what I can find of official information, the Czech Republic has suspended the processing of visa applications and issuance of visa at the embassy in Beijing and the consulates in China (Shanghai, Chengdu) and Hong Kong. It is worth to notice that this restriction affects also non-chinese residents of China, who are now also not able to apply for a visa.

Some media have indeed reported that the visa ban applies to all Chinese citizens, but there is no official information supporting that and I believe these reports to be mistakes. It seems very well possible for Chinese citizens who are resident outside China to get a Czech visa from the consulates at their place of residence and there seem to be no ban for residents of China to enter the Czech Republic if they are already in posession of a visa.

Unless the Czech Republic is the main destination in the Schengen area, it should also still be possible for Chinese residents to obtain a Schengen visa from other consulates and then use that visa for travel to the Czech Republic. It will probably have little impact on actual travel patterns for a single Schengen country to impose restrictions as have been done here.

"I'll fly to London again for work, and I look Asian. The Coronavirus is making racists target Asians in London - reported in Sky, Guardian. See my other question.


It's better not to make eye contact, or reply to any racist taunts or remarks. Right? 
Note well the Bystander Apathy Effect. Even if I yell for help, people may not assist especially if they're racists too! 

Postulate that
I keep walking, but these racists follow me.  I'm 51 and can't out-run  these chavs for long. 
I'm too far from a police or fire station.

Then what do I do? Even if I find a fire extinguisher, spraying it at them won't cripple them.  

","First of all, let's emphasise that this remains the actions of a very small minority of people. The media have a general tendency to amplify things. If you look at reporting of events in many places, you sometimes have the impression there's a widespread civil war going on when there are actually only small isolated incidents.

Then, you need to distinguish the type of abuse. The first situation is verbal abuse. It is of course not something you want to deal with, but at least there's no physical harm. I'd say you should not confront the authors of that abuse (to avoid getting into the physical harm part below). Walk away and report it to the police.

If it comes to threats of physical harm, again, try to de-escalate the situation, then report it to the police. You could tell your aggressors that if they touch you they incur the risk of catching said virus (even though it's most probably completely false, but those people are stupid enough), so they should refrain from doing so.

The emergency number is 999 or 112 from a mobile. If you need help, call them. If you need help from bystanders, be direct. Don't say ""someone please help"", designate someone and instruct them to call 999.

"I am travelling to Bangkok and just got to know that I will be flying on a  22 year old Thai Airways Boeing 777-200, how safe is it to fly on a plane this old?


","I think the myth here is that an older aircraft isn't safer because of wear and tear. That's not really true due to maintenance requirements. If you want to, you could fly in a Douglas DC-3 (1930s aircraft) today if you had enough time and money to find the operator. Any aircraft can be operated if it is still maintained.

The reason aircraft get retired from commercial airlines is generally they become expensive to maintain, not because they stopped being airworthy. Airlines don't buy one airplane, they buy a fleet, which includes the maintenance portion. The larger picture there is you need


Trained pilots
Mechanics to repair them
Available parts


It's #3 that will eventually drive an aircraft out of general use. Delta, which flies the MD-80/88/90 series, is set to retire the aircraft in 2022.


  Delta will remove the MD-90 two-years earlier than previous plans to “realize fleet simplification benefits,” said Jacobson during the airline’s second quarter earnings call on July 11. The airline will replace the aircraft with ones from its current orderbook, which includes 77 Airbus A220s(sic, likely A320) and 144 Airbus A321s and A321neos, he added.
  
  The early retirement of some MD-90s was understood to be to support the in-service fleet, with parts from the removed aircraft available to support operational aircraft.


In other words, Delta cannibalized some of its fleet for parts, and may be actively doing so with its rolling retirement. McDonnell-Douglass (who made the planes) is now owned by Boeing, and production of the MD-90 ceased in 2000. These planes can still be flown after Delta retires them, but Delta will have a hard time (i.e. expensive) sourcing new parts, which makes less sense for an active carrier airline operating thousands of aircraft around the world. Other aircraft of similar size are in production and their parts are more plentiful.

The planes will be sold to secondary carriers. You might have seen one in the news recently, when the US government chartered a flight with Kalitta Air (likely operating a 747-400) to evacuate US citizens exposed to the coronavirus. These companies operate smaller fleets and, since they get cheaper used aircraft, the increased cost of finding parts will be offset.

TL;DR

The Boeing 777 is still in production. It is as safe as any aircraft in commercial airline use, regardless of age.

"I will be travelling for more than 13 hours through South East Asia, most of the time in a crowded environment like airplane or transiting at the airport. What precautions should I take to reduce the chances of contracting any contagious disease, such as Corona Virus COVID-19?
","In February, I flew into Singapore through Seoul, and back the same way to Toronto. Singapore had a jump in cases just as we arrived; Seoul's jump was happening while we were in Singapore. Here is what we did:


hand washing pretty much every chance we got. (I say pretty much because if you walk a long way in an airport you will walk past multiple bathrooms; we didn't go in to each and every one and have a wash.) But we did sometimes go and wash even though we didn't need to use the bathroom. For example, every time we returned to our hotel room after being out.
hand sanitizer after handling money, before eating, or when sitting waiting
use sanitizing wipes to clean the airplane screen and trays immediately on getting to the seats. I should have done the seatbelt and arm rests too and will on my next trip.
try to pay by credit card, using contactless, and holding my own card instead of handing it to someone to tap for me, whenever possible. Avoid cash -- it really is filthy
don't touch handrails and other ""public"" surfaces unless you actually need them for support. Keep your hands to yourself as much as you can. In Singapore there was a lot of wiping going on, but in other places I have not seen that
really try to touch your face less. It's hard, you just need to watch videos of people telling you not to touch their face while people behind them touch their faces, and then moments later the speaker does too. It's hard. That's why all the handwashing and hand sanitizing is important
if you cough or sneeze, use a tissue or your elbow to confine it, so as to cause less distress to those around you and lower overall stress - to do this, you'll need a loose tissue in your pocket that you can grab quickly. If there's no nearby garbage, you'll need another pocket you can designate for dirty tissues. When you see a garbage, empty the dirty pocket and sanitize your hands to lessen the chance you're passing anything along.
monitor your temperature. In Singapore this was done for me many times a day. On return home I checked my temperature twice a day or so for 14 days to be sure I was not running a fever.
tell the truth when you come home. Don't be that person who lies about where they have been. 


In addition, at least one friend has taken a laptop on vacation, not because she might need it during the vacation, but in case she was quarantined in her destination or on return before she could get to her home. 

There are enough cases in Ontario now that when I go to Toronto and ride the public transit, I'm going to take all these same precautions. This is really not just a travel issue any more.

"Can my ESTA waiver visitor from Japan extend her stay here with us until it is safe to return to Japan?
","Someone who entered on the Visa Waiver Program cannot apply for Extension of Status (i.e. extend their stay on VWP) or Change of Status (i.e. change to another nonimmigrant status, e.g. B2 visitor). However, there is something called ""satisfactory departure"" which can be granted to VWP visitors who cannot leave within their 90 days of admission due to an emergency like hospitalization or natural disaster in the US, to allow them to stay for an additional period of at most 30 days. I am not sure whether a fear of returning to a country with some disease transmission will qualify.

The US has also sometimes granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for years to people in the US who are nationals of developing countries that have suffered a major disaster with long-term effect on the country's infrastructure like a major earthquake, civil war, or Ebola outbreak, etc. However, I highly doubt that they would do that for COVID-19, as it is a short-term problem that does not significantly damage the country's infrastructure, and has mostly been in relatively developed countries. Also, Republicans have been wary of granting TPS.

"What would be the situation for a visitor should they contract Covid-19 and require hospitalisation whilst in the US?


Would it be classed as an emergency or secondary care? Does the US provide emergency care free of charge?
Do charges vary e.g. by state or hospital?


My question was prompted by this one Is it safe for an ESTA waiver visitor to return to Japan until the corona virus has been contained?, which made me wonder about the financial risks of extending a visit, given that many travel insurance policies limit the length of each trip. For example, I have an annual travel policy but cover is limited to 45 days. It also excludes any epidemic or pandemic.
","Answering my own question:


As stated in a comment by @DJClayworth, the US does not provide emergency care free of charge. Charges do vary between hospitals, and US healthcare is the most expensive in the world.
Visitors contemplating extending their stay in the US because of worries about the extent of the epidemic in their country of residence should check that they have adequate insurance for the entire length of stay, starting from the date they arrived in the US.

"My BF flies on Monday Athens-Zurich-Miami, with Swiss. He recently received an email saying that his flight details have changed, and he finds out that Lufthansa, ATH-ZRH operator, will most likely cancel the flight due to the COVID-19 coronavirus. The other flight is scheduled.

He went to the airport, but the booth told him that they assist only with today's flights, and gave him the central contact number. He calls, but fails getting through, most likely because of the heavy load of calls these days... He'll email them too, but with weekend ahead, it'll probably go without an on time response.

","He shouldn't get stressed too much. Lufthansa/Swiss are rearranging their schedule a bit, due to decreased demand. And yes, this will mean that some flights are cancelled. That does not mean that all flights are cancelled or that they won't take him at all. 

He has a ticket with Swiss, and they have to transport him to his destination, even if on a different flight. He does not have to worry about being ""left behind"" if he doesn't make his first flight.

Is the flight cancelled?

Currently, he does not know. He can (and should) check the flight status online (Swiss timetable and Lufthansa Flight Status).

As long as the flight isn't officially cancelled, it makes little sense to call or go to the airport - they can't tell you much. Also, it makes little sense to re-book if you don't know which flights are going to operate.

What happens if it is cancelled?

If the flight is cancelled, the airline will offer to re-book him on a different one: There are multiple flights from Athens to Zurich, but they could rebook him completely (e.g. going through Frankfurt on Lufthansa). If isn't happy with the new itinerary, they will usually offer other options. He could also get a refund, but it seems like he wants to travel.

If he booked it through a third party (e.g. Expedia), he'll have to go through them for any re-booking.

If the flight isn't cancelled, he should be at the airport early so that he can directly talk to the agents in case of a last-minute cancellation.

Other things

On their information page Swiss currently informs passengers that they can freely re-book all tickets bought before March 5th. (However, it seems like your BF wants to travel).

In case of a delay or cancellation your BF may also have a right to compensation under the EU rules - at least in this case, when the outbreak directly the reason for the cancellation.
"
"Has anyone had success getting airlines to issue refunds, or at least extend the value of unused tickets, for upcoming travel that had been booked long before the COVID-19 outbreak?  

My question specifically concerns United Airlines and non-refundable tickets to destinations that are not otherwise covered by any explicit guidance.  I'd be interested in hearing about others though.

It seems like airlines are offering flexibility for new travel bookings but not ones made a while back.  And travel insurance will only cover you if your travel is individually impacted due to illness or quarantine.  
","Your question is very generic, so I answer in general:

In general if a government (or an airline) doesn't stop travellers or planes, you will have no direct refund. It means that both think that there is no danger.

So usually it is recommended to have a travel insurance (for important/expensive travel, like far away for holidays). On the other hand, also a travel insurance may not allow you to cancel: it depends on the kind of insurance you get: some (the more expensive) doesn't ask reasons, other are more restrictive (and again, if you are not in a risk category, and there is no recommendation from government) they will not refund you.

On the other hand, this is a special (and global) thing, so to get good news coverage, they may end to refund you. Cruise lines are starting this (also for old bookings), let's hope also the airlines will follow.

The reason about having such rules for new booking: they are trying to convince new people to book. Without such incentives, many passengers will not book (and after booking many will travel anyway), this will keep cashflow. Old booking: they have already paid, so if they do something, it is just to get good publicity.

Because the airlines will reduce flights, you may hope that they will effect your flight, so that you can cancel/rebook (or having credit for next flight).

"Do you know any website(s) where I could check how many COVID-19 cases Italy had 10 days ago?

Let me explain: We are travelling to the Dominican Republic at the end of this month with transfer in Germany (Frankfurt). At the start of this week, my country (Slovakia) banned all flights to and from Italy.

So I would like to check how many cases were there in Italy about 10 days ago, to maybe predict the future cases in Germany (possibility that all flights to Germany will be banned too). At this moment, our travel agency doesn't want to cancel our trip, and neither do we, because we would lose 80% of our money.

"I shall be traveling to the US from India on 10th June this year for an internship, accompanied by my family. I booked a round-trip Delta flight recently; it has a ~2 hr layover at Paris Charles de Gaulle. I'm deliberating on whether to cancel my tickets and choose some other route. Currently, there seem to 334 COVID-19 cases in Île-de-France (source: Wikipedia) but that does not appear to be a considerable percentage considering the ~12 million population in the region. 

I'm looking for some advice here, preferably from someone who has visited Charles de Gaulle recently or is well aware of the situation there. Obviously no one can accurately predict what the situation will be in June, but perhaps one can extrapolate a few things from the current scenario.  
","At the moment, assuming you are not a US citizen or permanent resident, or in a fairly small set of other aliens, you cannot enter the US within 14 days of being physically present in the Schengen area.  If that restriction is still in place on June 10th, you will have to cancel or re-route your flight.

But who knows: in three months' time, maybe the Schengen area restrictions will be lifted. 
 Maybe India will have millions of infections and be added to the restricted list.  It's impossible to say.

If I were you, I'd just keep my plans in place and adjust them as necessary closer to the actual trip, based on the public health measures in place at the time.

"Jamaica did a refusal of entry for Germany due to Covid 19 situation (cf. https://kingston.diplo.de/jm-de/aktuelles/-/2316366 | German source).
I have booked a flight that goes from Frankfurt to Atlanta with KLM Airlines and from Atlanta to Montego Bay with Delta Airlines.
But I booked the complete flight directly at Delta Airlines.

Will the flight be cancelled or do I have misfortune since I am from Germany? In theory I could still travel to Atlanta ...

Or is this question just speculative since it depends on Delta's goodwill?
","Update 12/03/20: The USA is now refusing entry to anyone coming from Europe, for 30 days. So you won't even make it to Atlanta. 



According to the link to the embassy you provided you will be denied entry to Jamaica. This will most likely already be executed by KLM staff in Frankfurt. This means you will be denied boarding in the first place.

The only exception would be if you are (also) a Jamaican citizen.
You did not mention when you are flying, so if your flight is only going to be in a few weeks or even days, the situation might have changed completely. Then you just have to wait and go an a day-by-day basis and see what the embassy has to say.

As per your suggestion that you could still only travel to Atlanta, I suggest you search for ""skipping one leg of a journey"" here on this site. This usually always turns out bad (especially for a possible return flight which will be cancelled by the airline). Since in the US you always have to check your bags again on an international transfer, you could get your bags at least and given the right Esta/Visa for the US you could leave the airport and wait two weeks there. Two weeks would be the minimum period you'd have to wait before being allowed entry into Jamaica. You would then have to buy a new ticket to Jamaica, of course and your return flight would have been cancelled and you would have to buy that one again, too.

With all this said, it might be best to call the airline (Delta in this case, since you booked with them) and see if they can give you a (full) refund.

  Going out to buy food is considered an essential purpose, Garcia said.
  
  Garcia said they are also mulling to recommend bars, establishments and other related entertainment shops to shut down during the 30-day quarantine which runs from March 15 to April 14.

However, it has been announced on 2020-03-16 evening a total lockdown, which is supposed to 1) lead to the cancellation of all outbound international flights departing MNL starting in around 72 hours. 2) might reduce/remove all taxi traffic?

I am currently in Jamaica with TUI all inclusive holiday. Just an hour ago I got email from Gov.Uk Travel advice stating following.


  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advise against all but essential travel to Jamaica due to restrictions imposed by the Jamaican authorities in response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. British nationals who wish to leave Jamaica are encouraged to make travel arrangements urgently before airlines reduce direct and indirect flight options. (‘Summary’ and ‘Health’ page)
  
  Time updated
  11:12pm, 14 March 2020

Does this mean or is there an indirect signals that UK government would be closing borders for all affected countries soon?

I reached out to TUI asking specifically that whether TUI would be arranging immediate flight in case of sudden news from UK gov to close borders in short period of time? Their response was lengthy but in essence they said they will try their best to bring everyone home if such case occurs. 

In addition I also got to know that outgoing flights from UK to Jamaica are suspended from 16th of March.

I myself and my partner are immigrant in UK and resident on Tier 2. Given the situation I am very confused on what should be my next move?

Should I arrange other flights immediately to return home or wait until next update?

Ps. I do have travel insurance, my scheduled flight is on 20th of March
","
  Does this mean or is there an indirect signals that UK government would be closing borders for all affected countries soon?


No, it means that due to Jamaica's restrictions there may be less planes available to return with.


  Their response was lengthy but in essence they said they will try their best to bring everyone home if such case occurs.


This is, for them, a logistic problem. Will the plane needed be there on the 20th for your scheduled return flight?.

Having a reservation relatively soon after the 16th is a positive point for you. Somebody who would be casually traveling from island to island less so. 

Assume nobody is interested in keeping peaple stranded. It may not work out exactly as planned, but as seen in the recent past, everybody was able to return.

Keep in close contact with your travel agent and make sure you are available at short notice to leave. 

If you are not satisfied with this arraignment, you can make your own. But assume this may be difficult. 

Also make sure that your travel insurance covers this situation if you expect them to cover the costs of your private arrangements.

"A friend of mine is currently in Cuba and was due to return to the UK on 2 April travelling Holguin> Montreal with Air Canada, and onwards to London Gatwick with BA (single PNR, booking made direct via the Air Canada website).

Yesterday she received an email cancelling her flight but without giving any alternative. Long-distance communication from Cuba can be difficult, so far she has been unable to contact the airline to find out if they will re-book her on an earlier flight.

I have tried to help her from the UK, but the ‘manage my booking’ option just directs me to a toll free number that doesn’t connect. I tried calling their Customer Services number in Canada but, unsurprisingly I suppose, could not get through.

FWIW, she is a UK citizen married to a Cuban citizen/resident but will need to try to extend her 60 day visitor visa (usually the maximum allowed) if she is trapped in Cuba. She is a 15 hour bus journey away from Havana and if possible needs to depart from Holguin. Only a few airlines fly into Holguin, the only realistic alternative would be Condor via Frankfurt, then Lufthansa to UK.

To date I don’t recall seeing many questions about Air Canada and flight cancellations. I am aware that they are offering a flexible change policy right now. 

My question is: 


has anyone else been in this situation with Air Canada since the COVID-19 emergency erupted? Given that her cancelled flight was more than 48 hours away, can we expect Air Canada to email her again in the next couple of days with information about an alternative flight? Any advice (apart from the obvious around continuing efforts to contact the airline)?

","Answering my own question:


No further contact from Air Canada following the cancellation email
It was impossible to contact them via any means
With assistance from friends back in the UK (eg looking up flight availability, checking on the status of travel restrictions relevant to potential routing options), my friend managed to get home to the UK by travelling overnight Monday to Havana to board an Iberia flight Havana>Madrid>London, arriving home after c48 hours travelling.


Her spouse does not have residency in the UK so remains behind in Cuba.

So, the answer to what to do in the unprecedented situation we’re all facing is be proactive, don’t wait for events to overtake you. Make your own arrangements to get home.

"My wife (a Kazakh national) is visiting in the UK on a Standard Visitor Visa, staying with my family. She arrived on Feb 1st. Her original intention was to stay for approximately 3 months, until April 30th, and stated as such on her application form. She had been to the UK twice already, and had always departed in line with her intentions as originally stated during her previous applications. Her current visa expires in July.  

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Kazahkstan will institute a one-month travel ban from tonight, preventing flights into the country. I'm a little concerned about what should happen if the ban is extended beyond that. 

I understand that the Home Office generally frowns upon visitors who stay longer than their stated intentions, even if they do not overstay their visa lengths. But if the Kazakh travel ban prevents her from travelling back to her country until a date beyond April 30th, might this cause a problem in her future visa applications? Or is it a reasonable excuse, and provided she explains the extended duration of her previous stay during the future application, might it be okay? 

Edit: On that note, she applied for this UK visa from China (where we lived at the time). Obviously, returning to China at this point, while theoretically possible (though we'd have to apply for new Chinese visas; they expired in February, a fact that she readily disclosed in her application), is hardly desirable. This is a circumstance that we could hardly have predicted beforehand. Her Chinese visa was temporary and she acknowledged this fact during her application. Might the UK officials think ""well, you couldn't fly to Kazakhstan, sure, but why not go back to China? After all, you applied from there"" ? I must stress that she never stated during her application that she intended to go back to China; indeed our plan was always for her to fly to Kazakhstan around April 30th, the original envisaged date of departure. Am I overthinking this, and would the specific country that she'd go to after departing the UK be of no concern to them whatsoever? 
","Normally, the UK authorities take a dim view of significant changes because they consider that someone who applies for a short visit but then stays very much longer is probably working illegally.

However, these are extraordinary times, and if your wife finds herself stuck because of travel restrictions she should have no problem if she explains that in future visa applications.

Note, however, that if she finds that she needs to stay beyond her visa she must contact the authorities to make arrangements for a longer stay.

FWIW, the countries that have imposed travel bans (there's a list on the NY Times) have not applied them to their own citizens. Your wife is likely to be allowed to travel, but might find it impossible to do so because flights are not available.

"I made a non-refundable hotel room booking through hotels.com. The hotel has contacted me to inform me that they will not be open for business during my stay because of the Coronavirus. I know I made the booking under the title ""non-refundable"", but my understanding is that I am not entitled to a refund only if I am the one to cancel the booking. I assume that, given the fact that the cancellation is not being made at my end and instead my order is not being fulfilled, I am entitled to a refund under EU contract law.

Edit: The hotel did not charge me for the booking. My card has been charged by hotels.com. If I cancel the booking through hotels.com's website it says I will not be refunded any money.

"I had a flight ticket from Madrid (MAD, Spain) to Miami (MIA, US) to fly in March with AirEuropa. I got an email saying the flight was cancelled 13 days and 21 hours before the flight. Am I eligible to get a cash refund? Am I entitled to further compensation?

The flight was cancelled the day after Donald Trump forbade the entrance of non-residents to the US because of COVID-19.

The answer from an AirEuropa agent is no, I am not. They offer a voucher that has to be spent within 2020, which IMO is very limited.

As I understand the EU rules, I can choose to get a refund unless the carrier can prove the cancellation was because of extraordinary circumstances. I guess COVID-19 is extraordinary, but Trump did not forbid flights to the US, but the entrance of some people, so AirEuropa could have flown that day.
","Under EU rules you always get a refund. The extraordinary circumstances only mean that they don't have to pay any additional compensation. So far for the legal side.

Their homepage does only offer vouchers, though. The reason is likely that they want to hold on to the cash - espececially since they are not selling any new tickets right now.

Scenario one is that they do it because they aren't customer-friendly and they assume that only a fraction of the passengers will fight for their money. Scenario two is that they don't have the money to refund everyone and don't want to go bust.

My guess is that they are likely to fight any claim for monetary refunds. Basically your options are to take the voucher (hoping they will still be around when you want to use it), or to fight for a refund.

"I booked an easyJet flight from London to Zurich several months ago. I also have an annual Coverwise travel insurance policy. I am a Swiss citizen but resident in the UK. 

I was scheduled to return back on the 23rd of March but easyJet has cancelled that flight. I am able to get a refund or change my flight date on easyJet but the next available date is not clear and looks like it will be after the 23rd.

Is there any compensation for the extra expenses of hotels (not yet booked) and subsistence for the extra days in Switzerland from either the airline or the travel insurance?
","I assume you have already travelled London - Zurich, and it is your return which has been cancelled, stranding you in Switzerland.

Whilst Switzerland is not in the EU, it is a signatory to EC261/2004. Thus cancellation of a departure from Zurich is covered by that regulation. 

Since these are extraordinary circumstances, you will be unlikely to receive the usual levels of compensation for a cancellation within 14 days of scheduled departure. 

However, this is distinct from the duty of care provisions. Provided you have not opted for refund on your cancelled flight, then guidance issued just yesterday confirms that this still applies, despite (or arguably, because of) a potentially lengthy stay: 


  According to Article 9 of the Regulation, which provides all relevant details, passengers
  who are affected by a flight cancellation must also be offered care by the operating air
  carrier, free of charge. This consists of meals and refreshments in a reasonable relation to
  the waiting time; hotel accommodation if necessary, and transport to the place of
  accommodation. Moreover, airports are to provide assistance to disabled passengers and
  passengers with reduced mobility in accordance with Regulation 1107/20069
  .
  
  It is worth recalling that when the passenger opts for reimbursement of the full cost of the
  ticket, the right to care ends. The same happens when the passenger chooses re-routing at
  a later date at the passenger's convenience (Article 5(1)(b) in conjunction with Article
  8(1)(c)).
  
  The right to care subsists only as long as passengers have to wait for a rerouting at the
  earliest convenience (Article 5(1)(b) in conjunction with Article 8(1)(b)).
  
  The intention underlying the Regulation is that the needs of passengers waiting for their
  return flight or re-routing are adequately addressed. The extent of adequate care will have
  to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the needs of passengers in the
  circumstances and the principle of proportionality (i.e.: according to the waiting time).
  The price paid for the ticket or the length of the inconvenience suffered should not
  interfere with the right to care (Interpretative Guidelines Point 4.3.2).
  
  According to the Regulation, the air carrier is obliged to fulfil the obligation of care even
  when the cancellation of a flight is caused by extraordinary circumstances, that is to say
  circumstances that could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been
  taken.
  
  The Regulation contains nothing that recognises a separate category of 'particularly
  extraordinary' events, beyond the 'extraordinary circumstances' referred to in Article 5(3)
  of the Regulation. The air carrier is therefore not exempted from all of its obligations,
  including those under Article 9 of the Regulation, even during a long period. Passengers
  are especially vulnerable in such circumstances and events.10 In exceptional events, the
  intention of the Regulation is to ensure that adequate care is provided in particular to
  passengers waiting for re-routing under Article 8(1)(b) of the Regulation.

"Recently due to COVID-19 outbreak, India prime minister Narendra Modi declared ""Janatha Curfew"" on March 22 2020 (sunday). Even Indian Railways won't run. How to travel long distance in India during ""Janatha Curfew""?

If you are part of the essential services, you should ask the relevant authorities how would it be possible to travel on that day, and if you can do your travel on Saturday instead (for example if you absolutely need to be somewhere on Sunday).

For example, if you are a medical doctor and need to go somewhere, there might be private buses/shuttles to move essential personel around the country, and will probably be controlled to make certain no one with signs of the virus gets on board.

"I've just read the official communication from the European Commission on EU passenger rights during the coronavirus crisis and think the information will be very helpful here since I have been seeing quite a few questions popping up on it and no good source of information.
","The full communication can be found here in English:
https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/legislation/c20201830_en.pdf

The parts I think will be of most interest to the most people are those concerning cancellations by the airline, cancellations by the passengers themselves and compensation for delays and cancellations.

Flight Cancellations by Airline

In the case of a flight cancellation by the airlines (no matter what the cause is), Article 5
obliges the operating air carrier to offer the passengers the choice among:

a) reimbursement (refund);

b) re-routing at the earliest opportunity, or

c) re-routing at a later date at the passenger's convenience.

The guidance also makes very clear that if an airline offers a voucher instead of the choice between refund or re-routing, this does not affect the passenger's right to opt for a refund.

Flight Cancellation by Passenger

In cases where a passenger cannot or no longer wants to travel, whether or not the passenger is refunded or re-routed depends on the ticket type as specified by the airline's terms and conditions.

In short...a passenger is not entitled to EU261 compensation  for to delays or cancellations related to the pandemic. The airline still has a duty of care to their passengers who are travelling, which you can read more about.

"My wife and I live in a major US city (Chicago) and are considering leaving for now to stay with family in a rural area a few hours away. Our reasons for this are mostly safety, seeing some of the reactions to toilet paper/groceries being low makes us both very concerned for what kind of civil unrest might happen in the coming weeks.

Our thoughts for why it would be good to go:


Avoid possible looting/rioting/violence
Emotional reasons (being with family, having more space)
Easier to keep distance from people with a much smaller population around you


Possible reasons to stay where we are:


Possibly spreading the virus (my wife has had a light cough for a few days, but no other symptoms)
Health organizations asking us to stay put (although we would remain inside once we got to the new place)
Maybe we're just overreacting and the chance of civil unrest right now is very low


I would like to know if there are any official recommendations on if this kind of travel is discouraged/forbidden, or even unofficial reasons why one option might be better than the other. Please let me know if this belongs in another network or if I should add/remove anything.

UPDATE:

Thanks for the advice, you've all made us reconsider and we'll be staying put to not risk spreading anything.
","Travel of this sort is either permitted or it's not. If there are restrictions on travel in your area you should follow them. If there are not then it's allowed.

For example, if you were in Italy or France on this day (March 21 2020) then such travel would be forbidden - it's not essential travel. As I understand it there are no restrictions on internal travel in the US - but that's the situation today and it could be different tomorrow.

You should also listen to the advice of medical professional about what is discouraged. Anything you do that increases contact increases the chance of spreading Covid-19 is going to make the overall situation worse - and most kinds of travel will result in increased contact. If your medical professionals are asking you not to travel unnecessarily, don't do it.

"I'm in the UK. I'd like to flee to China to avoid the Coronavirus outbreak.

What would be the best way to achieve this? I was applying for a TEFL program there earlier this year- it is currently not cancelled but who knows at this point. The program does not begin until August however, and that's assuming I am accepted.

If this is the best option, how can I best ensure that the outbreak here won't limit my chances? (Besides the obvious ""don't die of Coronavirus"").
","At this time it is best to stay home, self isolate and only go out if you really need to.   

In some countries the number of infected people is lower, or already going down, as in the first area that had been infected, but that is because of containment and isolation measures.
It is expected that a new or second wave will come, again leading to restrictions. And likely no country in the world will escape while accepting people to visit or move in.  

If you travel from the UK to somewhere else in the world, there is a huge risk of you spreading the virus. That will be for the for the next few months at least, but more likely for at least a year, or even a few years. (This is the negative view, but it is realistic.)  

For now there are huge travel restrictions, to avoid spreading the virus but also not to get people stuck far from home in a country where they do not have a support structure and an established life.
That might have changed by summer but it may also stay longer, nobody can predict things like that at the moment.

"My mom has come to US on a tourist visa and her I-94 expires on the first week of May. 

Due to the coronavirus, travel restrictions have been imposed in our home country (India). Also we want to avoid the risk of traveling in flights at this time.

Is there an easy way to to extend her stay in the US by one or two months?

I am aware that we should fill out an I-539 to extend our stay. But in-order to submit the online application it requires a fee of $370. 


Is filing I-539 the easiest way to extend her stay at this time?
If so, is it possible to waive the fee due to the coronavirus
situation? 
After filing I-539 should she wait for an approval to continue her
stay? Or is the receipt good enough?


Can you please help me with these? Thanks!

[Edit 1]: 
With the current situation of the virus, traveling anywhere sounds like a very risky operation, especially for elders. 

That is the main reason behind this question. If the US government will allow visitors to overstay until Covid-19 settles down!
","
  Is filing I-539 the easiest way to extend her stay at this time?


Yes.  It's also the hardest way.  It's the only way.

More seriously, there could be some sort of amnesty or other program offered to nonimmigrants in the US who are affected by the pandemic.  If that happens, it could save you a few hundred dollars.

But I wouldn't count on it.  I certainly haven't heard any mention of it, and the current administration is profoundly anti-immigrant, so it's unlikely to happen without political pressure.

In terms of risk analysis, the application fee will be well spent.


  If so, is it possible to waive the fee due to the Corona virus situation?


Applying for a fee waiver is going to make her look like someone with financial problems, which will have a negative impact on her application as well as future applications for admission to the US.  I would not do it.


  After filing I-539 should she wait for an approval to continue her stay? Or is the receipt good enough?


Once the application is filed, she can remain until it is refused, or, if it is granted, until the end of the period of extended stay that is granted.

"Back in January, I booked to stay in Hotel Disneyland Santa Fe in March (in Paris). Due to the effect Covid-19 has had in everyday life and travel, Disneyland Paris had to close including the hotels for guests who were not there at the time of the closing down decision. I contacted Booking.com 5 days before my stay at the Hotel and explained the situation and they said they would get back to me in 24 hours. 

In the meantime, I contacted the hotel and they said that I should only deal with Booking.com as it's their booking to manage. The hotels in Disneyland Paris also announced that for the visitors affected they would offer either a full refund or a chance to reschedule for a later date whilst keeping the same charge for the rooms as the ones in their original booking. 

Now Booking.com says that since the reservation wasn't cancelled beforehand and they're unable to cancel it after the arrival date has passed, they can only offer me half of the money back. I should note that on my initial phone call with them I wasn't told to cancel the booking or do anything for that matter, as they would have to investigate the best way to resolve this. 

The booking was made using my credit card, but since it was made in January, I'm now out of the period that I can ask them to step in and withdraw the money and return them back to my account. 

Is there anything that I can do at this point to make sure I get my money back for a travel that I was not allowed to make considering the hotel was not accepting guests and the French government was cancelling my Eurostar trains at the same time (Eurostar, by the way, has issued a full refund since my trains got cancelled). Alternatively is there any official route to report this behaviour or complain about it?

I live in the UK if that's relevant at all.
","You might be out of the period when you can request a chargeback, but you can still contact your credit card provider and require them to honour their obligations under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act if the cost was more than £100, as there is no time limit on that.

"Air France states that for COVID-19 related cancellations:


  ""... or complete the online form below to obtain a travel voucher. This voucher is valid for 1 year on all Air France, KLM, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic flights. This voucher will be refundable after one year if it is not used.""


Source

That seems like a ploy to circumvent EU261 regulations which I believe require a full refund in cases of cancellations. Air France is offering sort of a refund but with one year delay built in. 

Background: we have an US&lt;->India ticket booked on Expedia with an Air France ticket. We obviously can't fly this and some legs have already been cancelled anyway. We like a full refund, not airline credit.

Question: What's the best strategy to approach this? We shouldn't really call Expedia until 72-hours before departure, Air France says ""call your travel agent"" and I'm worried that Expedia will simply say ""airline is offering credit: take it or leave it. EU261 is not our problem"". Does anyone have some experience with Air France cancellations recently?
","I would say that at least Air France is being fairly up front in light of the (probable) fact that their cash flow does not suffice for the refunds that they are obliged to provide.  If they hadn't come up with this voucher policy and instead decided to acknowledge their obligations up front, they would probably nonetheless drag their feet a year or more before actually giving you the money.

That said, the regulation does in fact specify reimbursement within seven days.  So you could pursue them if you want to.  Short of hiring a lawyer, the regulation provides that you can seek enforcement through the national enforcement body designated under Article 16(1).  A list of such bodies is found on the website of the European Commission.

"In response to the current pandemic, the government of Canada recently said to:


  Avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada


Other governments have made similar statements restricting travel.

So, if one is to avoid non-essential travel: What essential travel is allowed?

Below are some examples that came to mind but what are exactly determines if travel is in fact essential?

Things that come to mind:


Journalists going to where they want to investigate for a report.
Going to help isolated family members
Business meetings and factory visits, whether to establish policy or oversee measures that related to the COVID-19 or other task related to production.


Is any proper documentation needed to show that travel is essential? Or do we expect gate and border agents to evaluate on the spot based on your word?
","Some examples that I have seen in the media:


a healthcare worker who lives in Windsor, Canada and works in Detroit, USA. There are thousands of such people and they cross the border every day. They are doing so to deliver an essential service (healthcare) so their travel is essential
a truck driver pulling a load of food, medical supplies or other essential goods. While in theory the delivery company could have the truck handed off to a different driver at the border, more realistically the truck and driver will be allowed in as essential travel
a patient returning to their home city to keep an appointment for needed surgery. Most elective surgeries, dentist appointments and such are being cancelled, but a person could have been away just before their scheduled surgery
farm workers from Central America are going to be allowed in to Canada because our farms can't function without them


What is not essential?


tourism
business or work that does not serve an essential purpose (making a movie, looking for new restaurant locations to buy or rent in another city, negotiating a big purchase business-to-business of something non-essential like bathing suits or makeup)
people who feel they would be less likely to catch this if they went to their second home in the country
people who prefer the weather in Ontario to the weather in Alberta at this time of year


If I was going to do some essential travel I would bring whatever proof I could, and I would prepare for a significant wait while my explanation was evaluated. I am tempted to say, if you have to ask, it's not essential. I personally have cancelled a followup CAT scan and MRI scan required by a clinical study I am in. Everything's been stable for a while, so I'm not going to the big city. It doesn't feel essential to me. 

March 28th, the CBSA tweeted this image:



Keep in mind that in many Canadian provinces, non-essential workplaces are closed, so where this image says ""work"" it means ""essential work"".

Also, this applies only to people without symptoms. People with symptoms, whether citizens returning home, truck drivers pulling essential supplies, anyone will be refused or (more likely) taken into quarantine until they test negative. Also March 28th people with symptoms will be refused boarding on domestic flights and trains, regardless of the reason for travel.

  That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes:   
  
  
  Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible  
  One form of exercise a day - for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household;  
  Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person; and   
  Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home.

"During July 2019, I booked flight UA7938 for March 30 through United Airlines for my honeymoon. With everything involving Covid-19 happening, I'm trying to see if I can get a refund for the ticket or an extension on the ticket. My main issue is that I do not know who is responsible for a potential refund. United is the marketing airline and ANA is the operating airline.

United is waiving change fees for flights booked prior to March, which I can apply to my ticket online, but I would have to travel before July 2020. I don't know what kind of travel I can do before July and I do not want my money to go to waste. On the other hand, ANA has been issuing refunds for all international flights booked prior to March. Do I follow United's policies or can I follow ANA's? Has anyone had luck with similar situations?
","When you buy an airline ticket there are up to 3 separate airlines that can be involved for each leg of the flight.  These are common known as :


The ""Marketing Carrier"".  This is the airline who's flight number is on the ticket/itinerary.
The ""Operating Carrier"".  This is the airline who's aircraft will actually fly the flight.
The ""Ticketing Carrier"".  This is the airline that actually sold you the ticket.


(The ticketing carrier will be the same for all legs of the flight on the same ticket. The other two can vary from leg-to-leg)

In many cases, all 3 will be the same - you buy a ticket from airline XX, for flight XX123, which is flown by airline XX themselves.

In your case, all 3 are not the same.  UA7938 is marketed as a United Airlines flight (thus the UA flight number), but the operating carrier is ANA.  What we can't tell from the information you've provided is who the Ticketing Carrier is - and that's the one that actually matters here!

If you purchased your ticket directly from an Airline website, then you can be fairly sure that's the ticketing carrier.  If you purchased it from a travel agency, then it's a little more complex.  In general, if all flights on a ticket are for the same marketing airline (eg, all UAxxx flight numbers) then most likely the ticket was issued by that airline.

To be certain, you'll need to check the ticket itself. In your email confirmation (or on the relevant website for where you bought the ticket) you should find a ""ticket number"" which is generally around 13 numbers long.  The first 3 digits in this number show who the Ticketing Carrier is.  If this number is 016, then your ticket was issued by United Airlines.  If it's 205, ANA.  If it's 014, it's Air Canada.

Now, back to your original question. The policies that apply in a situation like this will be the policy of the TICKETING carrier.  That carrier might be influenced by the OPERATING or MARKETING carriers policies, but officially it is the ticketing carrier that you've paid for your ticket, and it's them that has your money up until the time that you actually take the flight.

In your case it's most likely that United is the ticket carrier so it would be their policies that apply - but you'll need to check the ticket number to be sure!

"Extended family (2 adults, 2 kids) is currently stuck in New Zealand because of the coronavirus. Their original return flight was cancelled. They are German citizens.

They now say they don't have any possibility to leave the country since all countries where a transfer would have to occur would not let them in, not even airside transfer! Is this true?

If not, what would prevent them from buying an AKL-MEL-DOH-FRA ticket? This seems to be the only possible and viable option that prevents immigration along the route or landing in another Schengen country before. Also, Qatar seems to be the only airline that is still flying from that area and directly into Frankfurt.

Or are the special return flights announced by the German government their only chance to come home?
","For your proposed routing, Timatic currently says:


  
  Transit - Australia (AU)
  
  
  Passengers are not allowed to transit or enter Australia. 
  Passengers departing from New Zealand with a confirmed onward ticket on the same calendar day to return home are allowed to transit through Australia. They must remain airside and must have not been in China (People's Rep.), Iran, Italy or Korea (Rep.) in the past 14 days.
  
  
  
  (...)
  
  Visa required, except for Nationals of Germany transiting through Brisbane (BNE), Darwin (DRW) or Melbourne (MEL) with a confirmed onward ticket for a flight to a third country within 8 hours. They must stay in the international transit area of the airport and have documents required for the next destination. 
  
  
  Transit - Qatar (QA)
  
  
  TWOV (Transit Without Visa):
  Visa required, except for Passengers with a confirmed onward ticket for a flight to a third country within 24 hours. They must stay in the international transit area of the airport and have documents required for the next destination. 


So it should be possible if they can book that itinerary as a single ticket (so that luggage is checked through).

I can't find this itinerary, however I see AKL-DOH-FRA on Qatar Airways on Sunday.

"I'm an American Jew, and my American college roommate is an expat who has been living in Qatar for the last few years. He is Catholic. I told him I want to visit him but he has repeatedly warned me that as a Jewish person this might be a risky move for me, due to his perception of Qatar's opinion of Jewish people.


Is there any truth to what he is saying? 
If so, is there anything I
can do to still ensure a safe trip?

","No, there is virtually no risk to visiting Qatar as a Jew, nobody even needs to know you're one since US citizens can visit without a visa and your religion is never asked.  You may draw some attention if dressed in full-on Hasidic clothing though.

That said, for time being this is a moot point, since Qatar has banned all non-citizens from entering until the coronavirus crisis calms down.

"I am planning to rent an apartment for a year in Cambridge, UK. We liked a property, but the owner wants to rent it through booking.com, and he is physically located in Switzerland. He sent us the following email.


  Hi ****,
  
  I am sure you are aware of the current virus pandemic spread
  worldwide; all doctors here in Switzerland are now the 1st line of
  defense in the race to control the spread of the virus. Since I'm
  working over 16 hours/day to help my colleagues to fight this pandemic
  and as well it's not recommended to get a flight these days, a viewing
  before completing the transaction through Booking.com would not be
  possible.
  
  Also a video tour of the property is available if you would like to
  check it out: URL 
      Allow me to explain the Booking.com process step by step.
  
  
  Upon your request, I will list the property online on Booking.com for GBP 1,100 / month with all the bills included.
  I will send you the booking invitation through the Booking.com system so you will have 24 hours to confirm it or the invitation will
  expire.
  Once you receive the booking invitation from Booking.com, you will have to choose your check-in date ( this would be the date that you
  would prefer to move in ) &amp; staying period ( minimum one month and
  maximum five years )
  After registration, you will have to pay £ 2,200 to Booking.com to get your reservation confirmed. The payment of £ 2,200 would be used
  as a 1 (one) month of rent + 1 (one) month security deposit. You can
  use it as the last month of rent or take it back at the end of your
  stay.
  Booking.com will automatically provide the tenancy agreement. Booking.com's policy allows maximum 1-month bookings, but choosing a
  more extended period will enable you to have the contract for it and
  receive the invoice each month during the selected period.
  Your deposit will be held by Booking.com in their system until your check-in, after which will be put in a DPS as per law.
  After Booking.com confirms your payment of £ 2,200 Keycafe ( https://keycafe.com ) will provide you the location of the keys since
  it is their main partner in these transactions. If you don't like the
  property for any reason, Booking will refund your money on the same
  day. If, after the viewing, you decide to rent it, you will have to
  sign the tenancy agreement and forward it to me by fax or email.
  
  Let me know when would be the best time for you to list the property
  online on Booking.com and forward you the listing.
  


Is this a genuine method to rent properties in a different country through booking.com, or is it part of an elaborate scam?
","This is 100% to be a scam. Let's see why:


a viewing before completing the transaction through Booking.com would not be possible. &lt;= this is where you should run screaming and not read anything else. Even if the place exists, how would you know it's not a mold infested, badly insulated garbage heap?
If they wanted to do a  real long term rent through an app they would use airbnb which allows for this and not booking.com which doesn't. It is a huge red flag they want to use a platform not suited for long term. 
I will send you the booking invitation through the Booking.com system &lt;= once again, airbnb has this but even there only after enquiring after a property, Booking.com very simply does not have such a feature. This person is talking nonsense, we will see why.
Booking.com will automatically provide the tenancy agreement. &lt;= the very reason Booking.com stops at 30 days is because in a lot of jurisdictions 30 days is where a short term becomes a tenancy and booking.com does not want to mess with tenancy agreements. Booking.com most assuredly will not provide a tenancy agreement! I have first booked an apartment with Booking.com close to five years ago and there's nothing even remotely close to a tenancy agreement in all those emails, I reviewed a few again.
If you don't like the property for any reason, Booking will refund your money on the same day. &lt;= Booking.com doesn't exactly work like that. As this blog post shows, the host sets the cancellation policy and up until very very recently the scammer was able to siphon the funds off as soon as the reservation becomes 90% non-refundable, otherwise on the guest’s check-in date. See for example here. Right now, because of the COVID-19 situation, they can only get their money one day past check in per this update but I somewhat suspect they are not 100% up-to-date. Also, do you want to convince Booking.com that the apartment simply doesn't exist within less than 24 hour before your money is gone? If Booking.com doesn't side with you then your only avenue is to sue them in a Dutch court of law.


Finally, if I needed to make a grim bet, I would put my money on this being nothing more than bait-and-switch and they don't want to use Booking.com: you agree to this, and after some hemming and hawing and probably a few juicy photos they come back complaining about some problems with booking.com listing and ask for a plain vanilla WU wire. By this time you are hopefully hooked enough to go ahead with it, if not, what's there to lose for them? You can even test it by agreeing and see what happens, just don't send money to them... 

And if you are wondering how people rent long term in a different country: they might have boots on the ground (company or friend) and if they don't then just do a short term rent much like it'd be a vacation and get a place once you are there. Easy as pie. I did so when I landed in Vancouver.
"
"This year I had something happen to me twice, which I never witnessed before nor I thought possible: An airline has flights for the legs that I'd like to fly on, but if I try to book the whole trip, it only proposes me a more complex trip with an extra leg. In the meanwhile, the desired booking is possible on an OTA website.

I presume that this might be because OTAs have access to more inventory, but this seems weird. The two examples were:

London to Yekaterinburg: I flew with British Airways + S7. They are partner airlines and S7 can sell me the London-Moscow leg of the trip, but S7 was only offering me a more complex trip (something like: London - Berlin - Moscow - Yekaterinburg)

London to Longyearbyen: I booked a SAS trip with Layover in Oslo (cancelled due to Covid19), but the SAS website was only offering me trips like: London - Copenhagen - Oslo - Longyearbyen or London - Stockholm - Oslo -Longyearbyen 

In the above cases, I booked from an OTA, but I'd really prefer to avoid in the future (in one direction, my luggage couldn't be checked-in all the way through even if that went smoothly on the way back. I got multiple check-in codes for the same booking, and making changes is just overall much more painful if a travel agent is involved).

I just managed to find another example (again, for Longyearbyen: just an example, since I'm not currently planning of flying there in September):



As you can see, for the day only trips with 2 layover are offered.

But I checked on 4 different OTAs, and all of them are offering a booking with a single layover:


Expedia

Lucky2go





Lastminute





Gotogate




This seems even weirder, when you consider that the single legs are actually available for purchase on SAS itself:





But somehow, SAS doesn't allow me to purchase this trip directly with them.

How common is this? Are there other solutions besides booking via an OTA? Would I be able to maybe get the booking done by directly calling the airline? (and if so, would this be standard practice, or should I expect it to be hit and miss depending on the airline?)
","This happens quite regularly for multi-carrier trips. Less so for single carrier trips.

Airline search algorithms are often inferior

For single carrier trips, it's almost always because the airline's search algorithm doesn't find the trip you want, not because the airline doesn't sell it.

If the search tool is an in-house product, it may be inferior in an absolute sense compared to something like ITA's QPX search, which many OTAs now use. Writing a search algorithm for airline flights is a terrifically hard problem (formally it is classed as ""undecidable""), and airlines don't hire the kind of computer scientists who can solve it efficiently. Specialists like ITA have hundreds of computer scientists.

Alternatively, an airline's search may be tuned with different preferences to an OTA. A lot of airlines try to avoid overnight stops, even if that would be preferable to three flights at a higher price. I would guess that's the cause of your SAS problem here.

Solutions


Try the multicity search, and put some of the connecting cities in as if they were stopovers. When you choose the dates, choose the dates that you'll actually fly that leg. This is often a good bet, but it sometimes causes the airline to price your trip with a fare break point at the stopover (i.e., as a sum of one way fares instead of a single through fare): Iberia.com is particularly terrible for this shortcut. However, I notice SAS has helpfully removed its multicity feature as part of the dumbing down exercise that makes the rest of its webpage unusable on a real computer.
Bookwithmatrix or Google Flights can sometimes link you directly to the desired itinerary on the airline's site. (If you do this on aa.com, you'll find that you get kicked out at the payment stage if your credit card's address isn't in the United States. But it turns out AA doesn't actually validate the country field, so you can just leave it set to United States.)
Call the airline, tell them what flight numbers you want to fly, and give them the price you expect. There is usually a telephone booking fee for doing this, although if you have some status with the airline it might be waived, particularly if you explain their website was not good enough to do it online. I used to have a friend at the Amsterdam ticketing desk for British Airways. In what I consider a crowning achievement some years ago, I constructed a price for a trip from information on expertflyer.com that was 50% lower than his system or any OTA admitted, and after some back and forth with revenue management, he agreed it was a bug in their pricing system and sold me the itinerary at the lower price. :-)



  (and if so, would this be standard practice, or should I expect it to be hit and miss depending on the airline?)


BA, AA, KLM, 90% success rate, sometimes have to hang up and call again. Qantas, JAL, Cathay Pacific, their telephone staff and ticket desks are always reliable. Air France, maybe 50%. Iberia, Alitalia, LATAM: total waste of time. 

Point-of-sale differences in inventory

Sometimes, additional inventory is available in the city where the travel agent is based, compared to where the airline is calculating the price. To understand why that can be the case, you should know that ""how many seats left for sale on a plane"" is a function of the sales city as well as other factors. Airline websites, in my experience, usually price from the city of origin, whereas agents usually price from a fixed point. One way to see this is from the payment currency, which will invariably be the currency of the sales city. For instance expedia.fr prices out of Paris, regardless of whether the itinerary passes through that city.

This only seems to matter when the flight is filling up.

Ticket issuance restrictions in the fare

Sometimes, the airline really cannot sell you the trip. This may be because the trip comprises multiple fares and one of the fares has a restriction that it must be issued ""on the stock"" of a ticket airline. Stock here refers to the old fashioned 4-part carbon paper tickets, but the concept is directly implemented in electronic ticketing. For instance, looking at a cheap S7 fare from London to Yekaterinburg:

Category 15: Sales restrictions
  TICKETS MUST BE ISSUED ON S7.
         NOTE -
          SALES PERMITTED ON TICKET STOCK VALIDATED OR
          PLATED S7/421 ONLY.


Even though a BA plane will fly you the first leg from London to Moscow, BA could not sell you a journey involving this particular fare. Airlines always sell tickets on their own ""paper"", not as agents for another airline; in this case, BA sells tickets on BA plate (ticket number starting ""125-"") and S7 sells tickets on S7 plate (ticket number starting ""421-""). But a travel agent could pick any validating carrier with whom it has a ticketing agreement, subject to the fare rules and the agreement. So the travel agent has some additional flexibility. 

This really only matters when you have a particularly complicated trip with multiple airlines who don't partner together very closely.

"I have been searching for an answer to this but have not been able to get a definite answer. I am a Canadian citizen and will be flying from a foreign destination to Toronto and then have a domestic flight from Toronto to Vancouver. How would mandatory self-isolation of 14 days work in this case (self-isolate at Toronto or at Vancouver)? What other guidelines should I be aware of and what type of questions should I ask my airline? Any suggestion would be helpful because at this point I can't find any answer specific to this situation (foreign-YYZ-YVR).

Thank you
","If you are symptom-free, you are required to self-isolate on arrival at your final destination.

Source: https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html#domestic

As of March 30, 2020, all passengers flying in Canada will be subject to a health check prior to boarding. You will not be permitted to board if you: 


show any symptoms of COVID-19 or
have been refused boarding in the past 14 days due to a medical reason related to COVID-19 or
are subject to a provincial or local public health order


This also applies to travellers arriving from outside Canada.

If you are arriving from outside Canada and are deemed safe to fly, you may board a connecting flight to your destination. However, upon arrival at your final destination, you must go directly to the place where you will isolate, and remain there for 14 days. This is because you are still at risk of developing symptoms and infecting others.

You may be subject to additional provincial or territorial public health measures at your final destination.

If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you will not be allowed to board any flight until:


14 days have passed, or
you present a medical certificate confirming that your symptoms are not related to COVID-19


If you have signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19, you will not be allowed to use public transportation to travel to the place where you will isolate.

"During these weeks many flights had been cancelled because of the COVID-19.

Why do some airlines and air travel agencies send confirmation emails even if the flight has been cancelled?



Examples:


LATAM: Flights from Peru were cancelled because of the state of emergency. However, one day before the flight, my flight was still appearing as SCHEDULED.

I called LATAM to ask if the flight is indeed scheduled and not cancelled. They told me that so far they do not have that specific flight marked as cancelled in their systems and they recommended to check the next day (the day of the flight). They mentioned a refund can't be done because the flight is not cancelled.

Obviously, during the night, SCHEDULED turned into CANCELLED.
Delta Airlines: Flight cancelled, but they send emails how to prepare for the flight and how to reach the airport and buy seats.
Kiwi.com and Opodo.com.uk: Flight cancelled, but they send notifications via email and push notifications to prepare for the flight and prepare my bags etc.




Apart from technical issues, is there any strategy in this scenario (e.g. marketing, whatever)?

I am a programmer and I can imagine that in the source code they can simply have an if condition checking if the flight was cancelled to not send any notifications anymore related to how to prepare for the flight.
","'I'm a programmer...'

International airline ticketing systems are huge, complex systems requiring interaction with the public, the staff, and other huge complex ticketing systems. Ensuring an accurate and timely flow of information through such a structure is no mean feat.

These systems were built for an environment where most flights departed on or fairly close to schedued time. In a matter of weeks the world has gone from that to an environment where most flights are now cancelled.

Your 'simple ""if""' may not be simple at all, but assuming the change was to be made, the process of approval, development, testing, staging and deployment could easily take weeks. There simply hasn't been time for such development to take place, even assuming that the developers consider that it's worthwhile.

I suggest that with the chaos currently reigning in the air travel industry, receiving an email with directions to the airport has been considered unimportant. 

Airlines have bigger fish to fry.

","We do not know what will be the case in summer - the current regulations will be ""reviewed"", but it is unclear when they will be relaxed. 

For the current regulation the federal police (Bundespolizei) has provided guidance. Valid reasons include:


To work in Germany
To reunite with family


So yes, you would potentially be allowed to enter. If you are not married to your partner, her picking you up will only help mildly, as they cannot easily check if you are family. You can, however, bring your work contract to prove that you have to start there on day X.

Note that this is by no means legal advice, and the situation will likely change until the summer. Make sure you check the regulations before you leave, and try to confirm the rules from an official source.

"I am a resident of Pennsylvania (I have a PA drivers license) and I do not have my passport. I am taking a flight from Ohio to California in March. Do I need my passport for this flight? (Or for the return flight) 

The REAL ID law is the issue. I know PA is late to the game in their real ID licenses, so there was supposedly a law that until we get those, we would need a passport to fly domestically. But I’ve also heard that the law was postponed so I’m not sure what the current status is.
","Update March 27, 2020:

To reduce the need for people to go to DMV offices during the coronavirus pandemic, the deadline of October 1, 2020 has been postponed until October 1, 2021.  Thanks to choster for linking to an initial report by Bloomberg News.

Several news organizations have been reporting the new deadline at least since yesterday evening.  An official press release from the acting Secretary of Homeland Security is dated yesterday, March 26 2020.

The page quoted below has now been updated, as have the quotes themselves.  I've also adjusted the answer to account for the fact that Pennsylvania is now compliant with Real ID rather than being on an extension.



Have a look at https://www.dhs.gov/real-id-public-faqs:


  Q: When will I need to change how I travel domestically?
  
  Beginning October 1, 2021 every state and territory resident will need to present a REAL ID compliant license/ID, or another acceptable form of identification, for accessing Federal facilities, entering nuclear power plants, and boarding commercial aircraft. The card, itself, must be REAL ID compliant unless the resident is using an alternative acceptable document such as a passport or passport card, or state-issued Enhanced Driver’s License. The Act does not require individuals to present identification where it is not currently required to access a Federal facility (such as to enter the public areas of the Smithsonian) nor does it prohibit an agency from accepting other forms of identity documents (such as a U.S. passport or passport card).


You can use a Pennsylvania-issued document (license or ID card), even if the document is not compliant, through September 30, 2021.  After that, you'd need a compliant document or one issued by the federal government (for example, a passport or passport card).

Is Pennsylvania compliant?  Does it have an extension?  See the main Real ID page at https://www.dhs.gov/real-id, which shows a map indicating that Pennsylvania is compliant.  You can choose Pennsylvania in the ""select a state"" box below the map to see the details:


  Pennsylvania is compliant with the REAL ID Act. Federal agencies can accept driver's licenses and identification cards from Pennsylvania at Federal facilities and nuclear power plants.


On or after October 1, 2021, you'll need a Real-ID-compliant driver's license or your passport (or another document from the TSA list, if you have one).

"North Korea has closed its border to foreign tourists due to the new coronavirus.

I had a tour booked in March, I have been told I will get my deposit back from the tour company if the border is not reopened in time.

But I had flights to Beijing, a Chinese visa paid for, Chinese hotels booked. I only booked all these for my tour to North Korea, as that is one of the only ways to enter, do you think there's a case for a claim for my whole trip if North Korea doesn't reopen its borders by my tour?

I don't want to really just go to China, if I can claim my flights and hotels in China back I'd rather postpone the whole trip, plus I'd have to get extra hotels and activities planned for the time I would have been in North Korea.

I'm not really asking for legal advice, just wondered in general, if any country closes its border, is it valid for an insurance claim?
","Just a quick update, my tour was cancelled so I rang my insurance company and they voided my insurance due to travelling to a country that was advised against all but essential travel, even the Chinese part of the trip would not have been covered.

Luckily Swiss Air offered a full refund, also my hotels in China were kind enough to issue refunds even though they were none refundable rooms, I am planning to go soon so will still use them to thank them. Also the tour company to North Korea offered a full refund.

Not really an answer to my question, just if anyone else is travelling to China soon and you don't have insurance then try your luck contacting companies if you don't have insurance. 

Also if you're going to North Korea just take out the insurance with the tour company for that leg of the trip, it's quite cheap and through a Chinese insurance company which cover North Korea.

"We planned a 3-week trip to Japan in March, but because of the recent increase in infections over there, we started to wonder if it wouldn't be smarter to cancel.

This is our travel plan:


06-03-2020: Munich -> London -> Tokyo
27-03-2020: Tokyo -> London -> Munich


We are mainly worried about two possibilities:


The airports shutting down, preventing us from getting back (my boss wouldn't be too happy).
Ending up in quarantine because we have an infected person on the plane.


While there, we planned on staying mainly in the countryside anyways, so the risk of getting infected ourselves is rather low in my opinion.
","This question is likely to get closed as opinion-based, but a few reference points:


Unless things get positively apocalyptic, it is exceedingly unlikely that Japan's airports would shut down completely.  Flights might be reduced, but as a comparison point, airports in China -- even in Wuhan -- have kept operating throughout the crisis there.
On the inbound flight, this would require an infected person coming from Munich or London, which is statistically improbable.  On the way back, this is a higher possibility, but still unlikely unless (again) there's a major outbreak.


FWIW, I was in Tokyo last week, and while it's not exactly panic in the air, people are definitely taking precautions: temperature scans at the airport, more masks than usual, hand washing &amp; sanitizers, large gatherings cancelled, etc .  This in itself seems likely to limit the spread of the virus, making full-blown contagion less likely.  But at the end of the day it's your call.

"My mother is coming from Tehran to Chicago (layover at Istanbul) via Turkish Airlines in mid-April. I saw on the news that Turkey is closing its border with Iran due to Coronavirus.

I called Turkish airline number and they said: ""there has been no cancellation now but it may change"". The representative was very vague.

I am wondering does anyone knows about the situation, I am failing to get a straight answer from the airport officials and airline.
","It is completely impossible to know what the situation will be mid-April. We may be in a global pandemic situation with all flights cancelled worldwide, or it may all have died down.

What you can see is the current status of flights these days, on Flightaware for instance.

You'll see that at time of writing, it's a mixed bag:


many recent/upcoming flights have been cancelled
many recent/current flights are flying or have flown
many upcoming flights are still scheduled, but that can of course change at any time.




It looks like Turkish Airlines are the most susceptible to cancelling the flights altogether in this situation, but it's still pretty hard to tell (and things can change in the coming hours).

Right now, it will be completely impossible for you to get a straight answer from anyone, simply because the answer does not exist. Nobody has a crystal ball, nobody knows what will happen in a month and a half.

"I live in Iran and I have bought this Qatar Airways flight from Tehran (Iran) to Vienna for February 29. As far as I know, to this moment the flight is not cancelled for health concerns regarding Coronavirus. Although I don't know of any way to make sure about that. So I might have to go to airport and see what is going on. 

And I don't want to cancel the flight, since I should be there in Vienna for my job starting March 1.

But, in case the flight is not cancelled by the airline, I don't know what is going to happen to me at the airports. Some people say that they might put me in quarantine at Qatar airport or at Vienna airport, maybe for 14 days. 

Has anyone have any view or experience regarding such conditions? I am kind of panicked and overwhelmed by thoughts and concerns.  
","The first thing you should do is contact your new employer. They may have procedures in place for any people coming for affected zones (China, Northern Italy, Iran...) to be isolated from other staff and/or the public.

It is difficult to guess what measures will be taken by the various authorities in Iran, Qatar and Austria regarding quarantine and isolation, or even outright travel bans, as this can change by the hour.

Qatar Airways have already cancelled 2 out of 3 of the flights from Tehran to Doha these last few days, and in the upcoming days.

Even if there are no bans or quarantines, and even taking into account switching to a larger plane and cancellations/rebookings, squeezing passengers booked on 3 different flights on a single probably means severe overbooking. Be prepared to be bumped off the flight if there are Qatari citizens or residents and/or premium passengers that need a seat on that plane.

The remaining flight on Saturday has been rescheduled to over an hour earlier. Add to that there will probably be lots of additional checks before boarding, and the fact that there will be overbooking, and you should be at the airport a LOT earlier that you would normally have, probably before midnight. You want to be the first in the queue. If online/mobile check-in is possible, do it as soon as it opens. You want your boarding pass to show ""SEQ 001"".

I suppose the rescheduling is to account for additional checks on arrival (as well as thorough disinfection of the aircraft after the flight) in order not to have issues with short connections.

Current Qatar Airways procedures for flights from Iran:


  In line with various global and local health warnings, all incoming passengers from Iran and South Korea whose final destination is Doha and are showing no symptoms of the Novel Coronavirus will be asked to stay in home isolation or a quarantine facility for 14 days.
  
  Passengers arriving from those countries who are showing symptoms will be transferred to the Communicable Disease Centre at the Hamad Medical Corporation.


So if you do not show any symptoms and are only in transit, you should have no issue boarding the flight to Vienna, unless Austria implements bans or quarantines by then.

Good luck!

"My wife had a return flight ticket from Seoul to Barcelona via Istanbul at Turkish Airlines for March 6th. We received a mail today (March 2nd) saying please call our Call Center. We called and they said the flight was cancelled. They gave us the options for a refund or change. When asking which changes were possible, they offered the same flight for the 11th of March. I asked if there could be some problem because of the novel coronavirus and they said they had no information. We changed our flight to March 11th, because they said that if the same happened again and it was cancelled again we could get the refund.

Now I've learnt in IATA's list (https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm, update from March 1st) about Turkish ban of non-turkish nationals who have been to Korea recently. I think it isn't likely this ban will disappear soon (right?) so we're looking for alternatives like flights via Germany or direct flights to Barcelona.

Now I'm worried that if Turkish Airlines actually does their March 11th flight but they don't let any non-turkish nationals on, they may argue that no refund is possible because it's the passenger responsibility to check that they have all the rights to enter the countries for every layover, at the time they get the flight. Are we going to get a refund? I called the Call Center again but they said they had no information about this.

My wife is Korean but she is currently living in the EU. I think they should have known that because of my wife's nationality she was not allowed to travel. The ticket fare was the cheapest, no cancellations allowed. We had booked the 1st flight before the novel coronavirus was discovered.
","You are correct, that it is the passenger's responsibility to check that they have all the rights to enter the countries for every layover.  In particular, if you are not allowed to board, then Turkish Airlines will not be required to give any compensation.

The good news is, that the travel advisory does not prohibit people from transiting through Turkey.  In fact, since practically all Europe -- US flights are cancelled due to the travel bans of both countries, this is the currently the cheapest way for me to transit between the two, given that I have the right to enter both.  Get on a Turkish Airlines flight from Europe to Istanbul, and from there a Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to the US.  Since Turkey is not on the travel ban of either country, the flights continue as planned.  Also, since I am not ""entering"" Turkey but merely transiting through it, this is also allowed by Turkey.

p.s., I am aware that this particular flight had been cancelled; the above is general advice for others in the same situation.

"First of all, I will honestly admit that I adopted the style of question from the following thread: 

Is traveling to Italy safe during the COVID-19 outbreak?

However, unlike Nevi, I intend to disclose personal information s.t. it can be objectively judged whether traveling to Spain is secure or not. 


I am under 28, male and have no disease or anything similar - as far as I know, anyway. 
I intended to travel to Barcelona from 15th March to 05th April, 
getting there by train via Hannover-Cologne (ICE), Cologne-Brussels (ICE),  Brussels-Paris (Thalys) and Paris-Barcelona (TGV). On the return journey: Barcelona-Paris (TGV), Paris-Frankfurt (TGV), Frankfurt-Hannover (IC). 
The plan was to go to a language school by midday and in the afternoon, get to know Barcelona itself. This trip is being offered by my scholarship that I have for my studies. 
I haven't reached out to them yet, because usually, if canceling a trip to a a language school, they require you to pay the entire fee of 1,000 € (no spelling error), unless you prove you were ill (by going to a doctor). But maybe, they make an exception due to the circumstances - I think I should reach out to them soon. 
I currently live in Germany in a big city and my dad is a taxi driver who often has guests from the airport as well, so the question is: Aren't I equally exposed to the Corona-virus in Germany, i.e. at home? 
On the 6th April, my term officially starts, and from mid-April, I wanted to start my Bachelor Thesis, so it would be great if I weren't in quarantine in April. 
Also, I care about getting the virus to my home community - I mean, who doesn't? But then, the question is, shouldn't my dad stop taxi driving for a while? I told him my opinion, but he said we need money for a living. 
I have already booked the tickets for 360€ and after having informed myself, I probably would get back only 44€. However, I understandably don't care about the money right now. 


EDIT: Alright, I searched for an alternative and found one: I could take a ""Flixbus"" from Frankfurt (Main) Central Station to Barcelona directly and vice versa. The costs for the entire trip would be around 100€, and I can get easily from Hannover to Frankfurt/from Frankfurt to Hannover with an IC(E). However, the only question is whether I have to travel or not ... I mean, if the situation should escalate in Barcelona/Spain/Europe, then I could be in quarantine and that wouldn't be great. 

EDIT EDIT: If sb wants to now, I decided to cancel my trip. I will lose around 1,050 € at least, since my scholarship isn't ready to officially cancel the trip.

","Spain itself does not seem particularly risky, it's not the country most impacted in Europe, it has fewer cases than either France or Germany, most of them tourists or imported cases and is not considered a “risk area“.

Still, there are several things to be aware of:


Traveling in general does increase your exposure (to this and other viruses), you would be spending hours in enclosed spaces and at times crowded public transportation, which, everything else being equal, is riskier than staying at home in either of the countries you would be crossing.
The itinerary you describe would have you going through France, which is developing into one of the most severely affected countries in Europe. There are several clusters whose source hasn't been fully elucidated, including one very close to Paris. At this moment, the French government does not advise against travel in general (only in the Oise and Haute-Savoie département) but the situation could evolve quickly. It did activate “stage 2” of its emergency plan meaning the virus is circulating through the population and the focus is on slowing it down rather than isolating clusters and risk areas.
If the situation worsens, you could conceivably be putting others at risk. There are few restrictions on travel in Europe and blanket bans or border closures seem unlikely but if anything, Spanish authorities should be more concerned about people like you coming from France than you should be about being in Spain.
It's possible the outbreak would develop further while you are in Spain to the point of making your return more difficult or, indeed, mean isolation would be recommended when coming back to Germany. You cannot know this before leaving (and I speak from experience as this just happened to me coming back from Italy).

"
"I have a language course booked in two weeks in Barcelona and would like to get there either by train or bus (due to 'flight shame') from Germany in times of the COVID-19 outbreak. 

Going by train would mean traveling via Cologne (Germany), Brussels, Paris (that makes me really afraid), on the return journey via Paris and Frankfurt Main (Germany). However, there is also a Flixbus directly going to Barcelona from Frankfurt. 

Though I already booked the train tickets via Paris, I could stil get a refund and thereby get most of the money back. :-) So what would you say, is it safer to travel by bus rather than by train? 

However, I was also wondering whether trains aren't equally safe as buses, since I could just stand all the time in a TGV in the floor or just sit on my luggage where there aren't so many people?
","It is somewhat hard to answer this one. You obviously concerned, but not enough to forfeit the course and cancel the trip. You are a bit afraid, but not enough so to overcome you 'flight shame' and hop on a direct plane. 

However, you are afraid enough to consider either spending a 25-hour trip on a Flixbus or a 13-hour train trip standing on the corridor. For some reason you are more afraid of Paris than Cologne or Barcelona, and more afraid of trains than buses.

At this point, my honest suggestion is that you do whatever makes you feel most comfortable. 

Given that you have already decided to travel, and to travel by either train or bus, the choice between those two matters little.

On a train, you'll be in a carriage with 120 people. A dozen or so in close proximity to you. In a bus you'll be with 60 people. A dozen or so in close proximity to you. There is no evidence that one is significantly riskier than the other.

If you want to minimise your time with people, take a plane or rent a car.

"My international conference in Europe this May has been canceled due to the COVID-19. I have a ticket, purchased from TAP air Portugal, from Toronto, Canada to Lisbon. Because it is a non-refundable fare, they don't want to give a refund.

They won't allow me to reschedule later than May 31 of this year. This won't be useful for me.

What options do I have? I'd prefer to get a full refund.

(I am a US citizen if it matters)

Note: They offered to refund just the taxes, which is about 10% of the value. That's not horrible, but I'd rather have the whole thing returned.
","Since you bought a non-refundable ticket, the airline does not have to refund you. Travel insurance could pay out if you have “event cancellation” cover. However, since the the Canadian government does not advise against travelling to Portugal, it’s unlikely that most generic policies will pay out.

I would say that your best option is just to wait. It’s possible that the flight could be cancelled either due to official travel advisories or reduced demand. In this case, you’ll be eligible for a full refund.

"I have a train travel booked through Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
All three legs of the travel are booked through bahn.de, and the Germany into Switzerland leg I can find back on the system of that site. I have asked a question and they will (or at least should) get back to me on that.

The other two legs, (one from Basel to Milan, the other from Milan to Naples,) are booked by bahn.de on Trenitalia, and the German site does not recognize the PNR number for the booking.

In most cases I would not bother to try to cancel/get a refund as they are super economy tickets which do not allow refunds, but with the health situation in Northern Italy, I want to try to get a partial or full refund, (just like I would get from the airlines if they have to cancel flight.)

I hope someone is able to tell me how to ask for the (partial) refund or whether it is better to wait till almost the day of travel. The date on the ticket is 18th of March, 2020.
","Italian long distance train tickets work along a completely different system then German train tickets. Italian trains have passenger manifests. German trains don't.  That is why you cannot find any Italian PRNs in the German system. Deutsche Bahn does not use PNRs at all (as they do not care the slightest bit about who is on their trains...)
You could try if you can find your PNRs on the Trenitalia website. But I do not know if you could cancel your tickets there. Cancelling tickets you should do via the agent you booked them with. 

If you created a login with bahn.de you should be able to see your orders there, and maybe cancel them, and you can otherwise just email them. 

But you also may just be out of luck. I had to cancel a trip to Germany because of the COVID-19 situation, and I am not getting any refunds either. See if your travel insurance will refund them.

Due to the COVID-19 disease outbreak,
the student decided that it was too risky to travel,
and so he/she will remain in city A.

I noticed the following text in the electronic ticket:


  TICKET IS NON-REFUNDABLE
  
  NO SHOW PENALTY AT USD 250 PER TICKET


Questions:


Will my university or the student have to pay a no-show penalty
if he/she does not show up for the flight?
Should I take the effort to cancel the tickets with the airline?

Since the tickets are non-refundable,
I am assuming that my university will not get any money back for cancelling the tickets,
so there does not seem to be any benefit to us for cancelling the tickets.


(Note: city B is not yet a super high risk destination for COVID-19,
so I don't foresee the airline allowing a full refund for the airline tickets.)



I explain what I decided to do in the answer below.
","Non-refundable doesn't mean what you seem to assume - it does not mean that the money is lost. It means that you don't get it back.

That might seem an irrelevant difference, but often it is not - you can use the value of the ticket for further bookings with the airline (for the same flier, not just anybody).
If you cancel the ticket, you typically have 365 days (from day of payment, not day of flight) to use the value for another booking.

The no-show fee is a fee that gets taken out of your remaining value - if the flier simply doesn't show up (instead of cancelling), he will not get the full ticket value parked, but it will be reduced by the no-show fee.
So you should definitely cancel, as it will save the no-show fee. Only if the person is not going to fly within a full year is the ticket value completely lost.

"Apparently flights toward and from Italy are being cancelled, I presume this is due to Covid-19 spread. Is still possible to enter from and to Italy by other means from Spain? train?
","According to multiple sources:


  Italy’s 60-million people will only be able to travel for work, medical reasons or emergencies until April 3 2020. All schools and universities, which were closed nationwide last week until March 15 2020, will now not reopen before next month. [Reuters]


So you are going to need permission and a good reason to do any travelling at all in Italy for the next few weeks. You should be aware that you are likely to face quarantine on your return.
"
"I understand that there will be some issues. 

I have got a single entery Italian Schengen Visa valid early April for 2 weeks. But because of the coronavirus, Italy is under lockdown, which means that I am unable to make my trip as planned.

Now if I changed my planned destination and to visit Greece (by flight via Paris) instead, can I enter France with my already issued Italian Schengen Visa?

I can provide my new air ticket and hotel reservations, but I won't go to Italy at all. What other options I can choose if I need to make the trip on the same dates?
","EDIT: This is a fast evolving situation. Under the current circumstances I suggest anyone planning to come to Europe just cancel or postpone. 

A Schengen visa normally allows one to enter any Schengen country. 
There is no obligation to enter the Schengen area through the country that issued your visa. 
So entering via France (or any other country) is not an issue. 
It is pretty common even.

The rule that you must apply to the consulate of the country that is your main destination exists to spread the workload, and to counter visa shopping. 
To enforce that rule the immigration officer stamping you in may want to see hotel and flight reservations proving that indeed you plan to follow the itinerary on your Schengen Visa application. 
Arriving at the border with evidence suggesting that your plans are very different from those stated in your application will raise red flags, and may lead to a refusal.

This under normal circumstances. 
However we are no longer under normal circumstances. 
Deciding to no longer visit Italy is completely reasonable in light of the current situation. 
So I would guess that cutting Italy out of your plans is not going to raise a red flag. 
You should however inquire with the French consulate and the  French border police (dcpaf-em-cnic@interieur.gouv.fr).

One last thing: 
The way things are currently progressing all of Europe will be where Italy is now in about 10 days (and so might your home country). 
You might want to completely postpone your trip.

"In light of the current pandemic, how can travelers ensure that they're not infected while taking the plane? Would it be sufficient to wear a N95 mask with protective goggles or does one require a full-blown hazmat protection suit to ensure absolute safety?

I am aware that the best course of action is to avoid travel altogether, but let's presume that this is not an option.
","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public: When and how to use masks


If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection.
Wear a mask if you are coughing or sneezing.
Masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
If you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly.

Protection measures for everyone
Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:


Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand
rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

"I am a French citizen, legally married to a US citizen. I currently live in Germany while my husband lives in the US.

I was supposed to fly to the US on Sunday (March 15) on a Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to visit my husband in the US for two weeks (until March 30). I am wondering if I can still get on the flight, and whether I should.

It is clear in the presidential proclamation that the travel restriction does not apply to spouses of US citizens. However I wonder how this is enforced. I travel with my French passport and an ESTA (visa waiver), I do not have any spouse visa or anything. Is it the airline who decides to let me on the flight? Or is it up to the immigration officer once I arrive in the US?

I also don't know if the flight is going to be cancelled. As far as the flight status shows, it is not cancelled, but I wouldn't trust that.

To make matters more difficult for myself, I got a United reservation through Chase's travel rewards program for a flight operated by Lufthansa. If the flight is cancelled or I cannot get on it, any idea who I should turn to for reimbursement? So far I have not been able to get a hold of Lufthansa customer service, they must be overloaded. I have not yet tried United or Chase.

Sorry this is such a specific and self-interested question, I just thought some of you might have similar situations or more information to share.
","There are still a lot of unknowns at this stage, so it is quite difficult to answer with any degree of certainty.


I expect you would need to be able to prove to someone (probably the airline, and then again CBP upon arrival in the US) that you are the spouse of a US citizen. Make sure you have a copy of your marriage certificate or other similar document, as well as a copy of your husband's passport.
There is a strong probability that many flights will be cancelled, though as US citizens and their immediate family are still allowed to travel to the US, there should still be a few flights. Which ones will be operating and which ones will be cancelled is the one million dollar question. You'll have to wait for Lufthansa to make a decision, taking into account that this could change quite late.


I expect airlines to get in touch with passengers to:


Inform them of these new measures, and the exact details of what documents are required/allowed.
Probably ask information so they know which passengers are still able to travel or not, which in turn will let them decide how many flights to keep, and which ones.


Given the surprise announcement, they're probably scrambling to make all of that happen.

If the flight is cancelled, you should be eligible for a refund. You should probably contact Chase at that point.

If the flight is NOT cancelled but you decide not to travel, we enter in the very gray area that the airline is probably not legally required to refund your ticket. They will most probably instead propose rebooking at a later date or the like. The fact that it's an award ticket may change things (is the ticket refundable?). Again, Chase is probably the right point of contact for this.

EDIT

The Lufthansa Group have announced the cancellation of all but 6 flights to/from the US from March 14th:


  The Lufthansa Group will continue operating flights from:
  
  
  Frankfurt to Chicago and Newark (New York)
  Zurich to Chicago and Newark (New York)
  Vienna to Chicago and from
  Brussels to Washington
  
  
  beyond 14 March, thus maintaining at least some air traffic connections to the USA from Europe. The airlines are currently working on an alternative flight schedule for the USA. Passengers will still be able to reach all destinations within the USA via the U.S. hubs and connecting flights served by our partner airline, United Airlines.
  
  All other U.S. flights will be suspended until further notice due to U.S. administration restrictions, including all departures from Munich, Düsseldorf and Geneva. The Lufthansa Group will continue to serve all destinations in Canada until further notice.

"I just had my Schengen visa appointment this morning in the UK and paid 300 pounds for my Schengen fees, Swisscare Schengen insurance, and roundtrip nonrefundable flight tickets with Swiss Air. However, as I am a exchange student from the U.S., my U.S. university just this afternoon(hours after my morning appointment) announced that all exchange students needed to return back to the U.S. immediately due to the recent coronavirus outbreak. I am wondering if I can get any refunds for what I have already paid?
","Insurance premium

You can cancel the insurance at any time before the coverage begins.  The company website says


  Before the beginning of coverage, ... you can request a full refund at any time. 


Visa application fee

Your visa fee is probably lost, but you might try asking if you can adjust your application dates.  I wouldn't hold my breath.

Air fare

Rebooking

Subject to some conditions, you can probably rebook the air tickets without change fees:


  SWISS will waive its rebooking fees for all newly booked flights worldwide with immediate effect and until March 31 and offer a one-off free rebooking. For existing bookings, the new waiver policy will apply worldwide to all flights booked by March 5 with a departure date up to April 30, 2020. Passengers will thus be able to rebook their flight ticket once to a new date up to December 31, 2020 without incurring any rebooking fee.


As noted by Mark Johnson in a comment, this policy applies to the entire Lufthansa Group.

Refund

If you're lucky enough that your flight is cancelled, however, you might get a refund:


  For cancelled flights: If you have booked through swiss.com or a Service Centre and you don't want to rebook your flight ticket, you can refund your ticket. To do so, please complete the refund form.
  
  If you booked through an (online) travel agency, please contact the travel agency.


I say ""might"" because I don't know whether you'd be able to get a refund if the flight is cancelled after you rebook it.

Taxes and fees

Even if you cannot recover your airfare, you should be entitled to a refund of certain taxes and fees for flights that you didn't actually take.

Possible insurance claims

If you have any travel insurance or other general insurance, you may want to look at whether it would cover any losses you incur.  Again, I wouldn't hold my breath, but it's better to check now rather than to find out after the claim deadline has passed that you might have been eligible for reimbursement.  (The Swisscare Schengen insurance seems not to include trip cancellation coverage, but I did not look very closely.)

"I'm planning a trip to the Netherlands mid-April, and I've already made reservations. I understand that because of the current coronavirus pandemic, I may have to postpone my trip or cancel it entirely.

However, instead of deciding now, I'd like to decide later (in April) if I should continue with my trip plans or cancel it (depending on travel advisories issued by my country (India) and the Netherlands, which would apply at that time). Which requires that I proceed with my visa application now (as I must apply at least 15 working days earlier). I understand that it is quite likely that I may have to cancel or postpone my trip (the global travel situation seems unlikely to get better by next month, but I want to stay optimistic, or at least not regret that I could have applied for visa in March if situations in mid-April do get favourable for a trip).

My concern is if the current coronavirus pandemic can be cited as a reason for visa refusal by the Netherlands embassy. I.e., does the current pandemic increase the likelihood of visa refusal when compared to normal circumstances? Are there any rules in visa policy of Schengen Area that concern with situations like this?

UPDATE: To clarify, my concern here is if the current pandemic will increase the likelihood of visa refusal. (Whether or not I'll be able to travel to the Netherlands in April is a different issue). The reason I'm separating these two concerns is because with new EU visa rules, I may qualify for a long validity visa (as I've been issued multiple Schengen visas in past), so if in the unfortunate case I've to postpone my April trip, I can do so &amp; re-plan on a much shorter notice. Whereas if I don't apply for a visa now and do so later, I'll have to plan for weeks in advance again (as I must apply for a visa 15 working days / 3 weeks in advance).

UPDATE: If the Netherlands issues a travel restriction in near future, will that result in a visa refusal or application rejection?
","There are restrictions in place, but AFAIK no current restrictions for Indian citizens/residents applying for Dutch visa. On the other hand, the Czech Republic closed their visa processing centers in China and Hong Kong several weeks ago, effectively preventing residents of China from applying for a Czech visa. It is at the moment difficult to predict what happens tomorrow or in the next days, but it is of course not impossible, that more Schengen countries will follow and impose restrictions on visa issuance.

Independent of the visa, it may also by mid-April be impossible to travel to the Netherlands. Several Schengen countries have today or in the past few days established very strict travel regulations or bans, effectively preventing many or most tourists and visitors from entering.
"
"we were intending to travel to Norway ( more days) and Finland (2days) from 18.03.2020 till 1.04.2020. Now due to  the quarantine mandate issued by the Norway government to all foreign nationals entering Norway it's difficult to complete the norway part of our tour. we had a Finnair Flight via Helsinki to Norway and we were leaving from Helsinki after 2 days stay there. 
Under this unusual situation is it possible that we do the entire tour in Finland without visiting Norway at all. Schengen visa has been issued by Norway.
this is an unusual situation as we will be compelled to be in quarantine irrespective of the health status in Norway. so there is no use in visiting the country. But we also do not want to cancel our plan. so checking out and need advice whether we can do the entire tour in Finland though originally Finland constituted a lesser part of our tour.
","I must say that nobody knows what's going to happen and that the situation is developing quickly in Europe.

First I would suggest that you talk to your airline.  Normally if you miss a single segment then the whole rest of your trip (including your return) would be cancelled automatically.

Given the circumstances then the airlines are generally being very flexible, but you must first check what they will and will not allow and then change your itinery accordingly and not just not take a flight.  

Next (or in parrallel) I would suggest contacting your local Finnish embassy and explaining the situation.  Tell them that your Schengen visa was issued by Norway, that you are flying via Helsinki anyway and would now like to spend the enture trip there rather than the couple of days you previously planned.  And then ask if they would, given the circumstances, allow you to enter and remain therer for xx days.

It really depends on how flexible they are.
They might allow this.  They might say that you should get a new visa issued.  They might reduce or waive the cost.  But you should check first.

If I was you, I would also consider making alternative plans.  Talk to the airline about rescheduling the trip, as it is likely that they will allow you to do this free of charge at the moment.

Only you can judge if this is a worthwhile trip for you given the cirumstances.
My personal opinion is that the next two weeks are going to get worse, and it will be awhile before the situation improves.

"You can read President Trump's full proclamation regarding conditions of travel between the US and Schengen zone here. Nowhere in this proclamation is a mention of a quarantine.

However, several major news outlets seem to be reporting different (and contradictory) things.

BBC reports: 


  Under President Donald Trump, the federal government has banned
  non-citizens from coronavirus-hit regions entry, but US citizens are
  allowed back into the country after a two-week quarantine.


Yet, CNN says 


  Returning travelers will be screened prior to entering the US and asked to self-quarantine for 14 days.


My question is, which is it? Will people exempt by the restriction face a mandated quarantine at the airport, or be told to self-quarantine? Nowhere in the official proclamation do I see mention of screening (which I am all for). If one of these people who is exempt from the restriction passes the screening (negative for the virus), are they free to go?
","According to the DHS announcement and fact sheet, the procedures for people who have been to Schengen Area countries within the last 14 days who are exempt from the ban (US citizens, permanent residents, and their immediate family members) are the same as the procedure for people who have been to Mainland China (but haven't been to Hubei province) or Iran within the last 14 days.

Basically, they will have to arrive in the US at one of 13 designated airports, where they will undergo medical examination. If they have no symptoms, they will be asked to self-monitor their health and limit interactions (the government also calls this ""self-quarantine"") until 14 days after they have left the Schengen Area, but there are no formal restrictions on where they can go.

Only people who have been to Hubei province within the last 14 days are subject to a formal, mandatory quarantine so far.

"I was wondering, do regular travel healthcare insurance policies contain a clause which excludes coverage in extreme situations/disasters usually? I'm thinking about a global pandemic of the SARS-CoV-2/coronavirus as an example. For context, I'm from Germany.

I know it is a whole different question, if you can actually get any medical assistance in case of a major breakout.

To be clear: Not asking because I'm in need of medical help - I just want to understand what the policies look like.
","
  I just want to understand what the policies look like.


They are all different, so you need to read the exclusions of the one that you have or plan on getting. They also get updated frequently. I checked a few today and about half of them to claim during the booking process that they cover Coronavirus related medical expenses. Interesting enough, it was quite cheap, so it doesn't seem like the insurance companies think this is a big risk.

"NZ, Aus and other countries are now requiring people to self-isolate for 14 days to ensure they don't have Covid-19.  There can be some rather strict ramifications if you fail to adhere to this.

What I wondered after seeing a question on FB (disclaimer: I run the beatthatflight facebook page) - how does one self isolate as a backpacker/traveller who is planning on staying in hostel dorms??
","Go home if you can!

If you are travelling in your country of residence, go home and self-isolate there.  If travel restrictions make this impossible, contact the relevant authorities for advise.  Usually there are some exemptions for essential travel, and travelling from a potentially crowded hostel to your home may well count as valid travel.

If you are travelling in another country than your country of residence, contact your embassy.  Many embassies are attempting to repatriate their citizens.  Chances are your embassy is already working on trying to reach you if they know how to contact you (I received an email from my government already, but I have my home and job here and the situation in my mother country is no better than here, so it makes no sense for me to repatriate).

Now is not the time to travel for non-essential purposes.

"A lot of countries in the EU are now closing their borders due to COVID-19.

I'm looking for an answer that applies to all such EU countries that have shut their borders for ""foreigners"", however, to use some example for my question, Poland states:


  Entry into Poland is still allowed for:
  
  a)               Nationals of Poland, their spouses and children.
  
  c)                Passengers with a temporary or permanent residence permit.


Now, as a not-Polish citizen but a citizen of another EU country, my understanding has always been that by default we have a temporary residence permit for any EU country we would like to travel to? (And obviously after 5 years we automatically get a permanent residence permit if stayed in the country)

Does this count as having a temporary residence permit (if I don't normally live in such country but would like to travel or transit there as a EU citizen)? 



P.S. There's a similar text for Czechia, Lithuania, Slovakia which is not as vague as Poland's:


  Passengers are not allowed to enter Czechia.
  
  - This does not apply to nationals of Czechia.
  
  - This does not apply to passengers with a Czech residence permit for stay over 90 days or for permanent stay.
  
  1. Passengers are not allowed to enter Lithuania
  
  -This does not apply to nationals of Lithuania
  
  -This does not apply to residents of Lithuania
  
  Passengers are not allowed to enter Slovakia.
  
  -This does not apply to nationals and residents of Slovakia. They must remain in quarantine for 14 days upon arrival.


But still vague whether arriving into the country as an EU citizen is considered that you do have residence. 
","Yes, EU citizens are foreigners. The Czech regulations now only allow Czech citizens, foreigners with temporary residence over 90 days and permanent residents to enter the country.


Graphics by the Ministry of the Interior of CR

Details can be found in this document.


  From midnight from Sunday to Monday, the ban to entry is extended to
  all foreigners, not only from high risk epidemic countries. Foreigners
  residing in the Czech Republic with temporary residence over 90 days
  or permanent residence are excluded from this measure.
  
  
  The prohibition of entry, as referred in point I. of the Resolution, does not apply for: 
  
  
  Czech citizens or foreigners with temporary or permanent residence
  permit in the Czech Republic, who are demonstrably regularly crossing

"In the current situation, many people will have to cancel existing flight or hotel bookings, and would like to get a refund.

In which cases can one get a refund?

the country where the property or airline is based
the point of departure or the destination of the flight
the country where you reside
the original cancellation terms of the booking
whether you bought flights and hotels separately or not
who you bought the flights and/or hotel from
whether they were bought as part of group bookings / blocks
other specific details.


But, in general, the following apply:


If your flight is cancelled by the airline, then you should in general be eligible for a refund.


For flights covered by the EU Flight Compensation Regulation EC261/2004, i.e. all flights departing from an EU/EEA member state or operated by an airline based in an EU/EEA member state, this is explicitly stated in Article 8 of the regulation.

Given that there are exceptional circumstances, no compensation is due. However, you must still be given the option of a refund, though one can accept rerouting or rebooking.

As airlines are cash-strapped, they will try to convince you to take a voucher instead of a refund. You can agree to it if you want, but they cannot force you to do so. Remember that many airlines will fail due to this situation. A failed airline cannot honour a voucher or a rebooking (though it's quite probable quite a few will fail before owed refunds are paid).

Airlines are required to refund you within 7 days. Given the very large number of queries they are receiving at this time, and the precarious financial situation they are in, it will probably take much longer, though, and in many cases any appeal will take enough time for the airline to have failed before you get paid.
For other cancelled flights not covered by EC261, the rule should be the same (they couldn't provide the service, so they should provide a refund), but this will be governed by local laws and/or the airlines terms &amp; conditions (conditions of carriage).
Note that several other countries implement rules very similar (or even identical) to EC261, including Turkey, Georgia, Moldova, Serbia and Ukraine.
Note that you should only ask for the refund if you are at home. If you are stranded in a foreign country, getting a refund may complicate things a lot to secure alternate travel. Though EC261 requires the airline to provide both the refund and a return flight ""at the earliest opportunity"", in many cases the return flight you want may not be operated by the airline but via some other scheme.

If however your flight has not (yet) been cancelled, and you decide to change your plans, then you do not have the right to a full refund (unless the fare was fully refundable, of course). In theory, the original terms of your fare should apply (including fares being non-refundable, penalties, etc.). Most airlines will however offer to either rebook for free or provide a voucher valid for future travel (usually valid for a year). Note that in many cases, the rebooking options or voucher validity will be limited to one year from the original purchase date. I doubt any will offer a refund in this case.

This applies also if you change your plans because the situation at the destination is no longer suitable, or you will not be able to get to your hotel, or the conference or event you were planning to attend has been cancelled, or you are stuck in yet another country due to the current travel restrictions, etc. As long as it's not the airline cancelling the flight, no refunds are due.
The case of countries suddenly closing their borders to some categories of people (e.g. the US refusing entry to anyone having gone through the Schengen Area, UK, or Ireland in the past 14 days) probably falls in the last category: as long as the flight still operates, the airline usually is not required to provide a refund.
Airlines will often proactively suggest you rebook your travel or get a voucher. Once you have accepted that option, you are no longer eligible for a refund even if the flight you originally booked ends up being cancelled.
For hotels, the rules are basically the same, though I'm not aware of any blanket legislation like EC261:


If the hotel cancels the booking (because they will be closed or completely inaccessible), you should in general be eligible for a refund, even if the fare was non-refundable.
If the hotel is still able to honour your booking, but you just can't get there (because there are no flights, borders are closed, you're stuck in another country, region or city) or no longer want to get there (you no longer want to travel, the event you wanted to attend has been cancelled...), then you are in general not eligible for a refund.

Here again, the hotel may apply the original rules of the booking (no refunds or changes at all), or they can (and many will) allow for a rebooking at a later date or a voucher. But ultimately, that is their choice.

Travel booked as a ""package"" (flight + hotel, sometimes other components as well) sold by a travel agent or tour operator usually have additional protections, especially those sold by EU companies. Most importantly, if the flight is cancelled or the hotel at the destination is unreachable/closed, one is eligible for a refund of the whole package, whereas when both are booked separately, one may be able to get a refund for one but not the other.
Added 18/3/2020 In some places, the government has changed the rules, and explicitly authorises some actors to not refund, and instead only provide a voucher valid for one year. See this answer for Belgium for such an exemple.


Let's add that this is were travel insurance should come into play, but double-check any exclusions and conditions that may apply. Also, don't forget that you may have multiple travel insurances: many credit cards have a travel insurance automatically included for all travel bought using the card. Check the conditions and exclusions of any that may apply (you can of course only get refunded by a single one).

"I submitted my application a week ago, before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared.

I am just wondering whether they can reject my application because of coronavirus, or would they still issue me a visa but advise me not to travel?

I had applied for the Netherlands. 
","This is a very dynamic and unprecedented situation, so nobody knows for sure what will happen.  So below is more of an opinion rather than known fact.

As it currently stands, travel into the 26 EU states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, is prohibited for 30 days and as such travel is banned for all non-EU citizens or residents (except UK citizens).

Assuming your travel request falls within this period then the following is likely.


They could reject you current application and tell you to reapply in
the future.  That this rejection will not be looked upon negatively
when you apply, and you should get a full refund of any fees paid.
Or they could put your application on hold and ask you in the future
if you wish to proceed or not with new dates.  If not, then you would
get a full refund.
They could approve your visa, but issue it with different dates and/or
an extended travel period.  e.g.  instead of 90 in 180 days, then 90
in 270 days.


If your travel request is for later than this period then the following could occur:


Issue the visa but advise you that you will only be able to travel if
the borders reopen.  If the borders don't reopen in time, you have to
apply again.  You may or may not have to pay the fees again in such a case.
Stop processing and ask you if you wish to postpone or withdraw your
application, and refund the fees
Stop processing temporarily.  Continue processing when the situation
improves, if your application is far enough in the future
Reject the application, and tell you to reapply again when the situation is clearer.  Refund the fees.


If the visa is rejected due to the Corona shutdown, then it will not be looked upon negatively when you apply again in the future and you should get a full refund.

"I'll try and make it short. My spouse will be arriving at an airport in Germany from a Non-EU country outside Europe and she will need documents, which I have in original, in order to pass, given COVID-19 restrictions. Normally she would enter on a 90 days tourist visa, as we don't yet have a long term family reunification visa. 

How can I reach the border control at the airport, in order to hand her/help her at the border, with the required document in original, in order for her to be allowed to enter as my spouse? Documents would be our marriage certificate and proof of my residency in Germany, I am a EU citizen living in Germany and my spouse is moving in with me, so we will then further proceed in Germany for a long term visa for her.

PS: 


No, we did not plan for things to happen like this. We planned for me to go to her and then come back together. COVID-19 really messed things up.
I did think I could send the documents to her by post, but that feels extremely ridiculous given that I can wait for her with the documents at the airport + It would be very very concerning, if the originals get lost in the post, given the chaos caused by COVID, as her country is on the other side of the world from Germany.


Edit - Appreciate all the answers. 

I've reached out to the relevant Bundespolizei and their answers are very cautious in this new world. I've sent out via 3 separate e-mails and received more ore less the following answer back from all 3: ""without a residence permit, third-country nationals are not allowed to enter the country for the next thirty days. To what extent an exception is possible in your situation cannot be answered at the moment. In the course of your personal responsibility you/your wife should generally refrain from travelling!"" So they have no clue how to address this. We've sent e-mails to the German embassy as well, to see if we can clarify via themselves, since the BP are asking for a residence permit or some kind of visa, where none should be required in the case of a EU Nationals' wife and which we can really only get in Germany now, since all relevant documents are here with me. 
","
  Normally she would enter on a 90 days tourist visa, as we don't yet have a long term family reunification visa.


Your wife will never get a long-term family reunification visa because such visas are not issued to beneficiaries of the free movement directive.

As a beneficiary from a so-called ""Annex II"" country (that is, a country whose citizens do not need a visa for short visits), your wife is supposed to enter without a visa and then apply for a residence card after entering Germany.

The trick, of course, is to find specific information about how the travel ban is being applied to non-EU citizens who enjoy freedom of movement through a family relationship but who do not yet reside in Germany.  This may be difficult as the number of such cases is probably small and the possibility may not have been considered by the people writing the policies.

the best I have been able to find so far is at https://www.germany.info/us-en/coronavirus/2317268 (emphasis added):


  EU-citzens and citizens of Great Brtain, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland and their family members will be allowed to transit through Germany to reach their home countries.


This suggests that beneficiaries of the free movement directive are included among those who may enter Germany.  Your wife might want to say that Germany is her place of residence (which is arguably true) but that she hasn't yet lived there long enough to get a residence card (which is certainly true).  Alternatively, she should call the German authorities and ask them what to tell the airline.  To that end, see How to contact border authorities in EU/Schengen countries? on this site.

Regarding the documents, you might try asking the airline if they will pass them to her when she gets off the plane.  My wife was in a similar situation recently, and that was the solution.

Part of this process was that the airline employee in the destination airport made a note in the airline's system that the documents were sufficient.  This was necessary for her to be able to board the plane without having the documents with her.  This may also prove necessary in your wife's case.

"I am a Brazilian citizen actually traveling and volunteering in the UK (been here for 5 months).  

I came with a normal visa plus the return ticket (in April 21st). Right now I'm in Scotland's highlands (this is relevant because I would have to travel quite a bit to get the flight). I can switch to any flight until December 31st.

My flight back goes through London, Lisboa and then Brazil. This is troublesome as Lisboa border will potentially close. I can think of 3 scenarios:


flight goes well and get home (sounds easier than it will be) 
flight cancelled and postponed for a date after my visa expires 
Flight-on-date but I don't take the flight to take care of my health and see how this situation evolves.


The question boils down to:


Is there any way to extend my visa or: is it too bad to stay longer and let it expires?


(I've tried to contact a few governmental entities with no response so far, which is reasonable as they might be overloaded). 

Disclaimer

As I've said on the bottom of the post, I emailed the embassy. They only replied today and the link they sent points to uk advices for chinese people, and it's completely useless. As I was expecting the flight state is rather uncertain (tap air portugal). You can check the cancelled flights. I would also recommend anyone having a safe chance to go back to do it. This is not the case. 
","Many countries are advising their citizens to return home while they still can. You should make plans to leave as soon as possible. Contact your airline to arrange new flights. If that proves impossible contact your embassy and UKVI to find out what your options are. Rules can be changed at short notice in extreme circumstances. What is not possible today may be perfectly possible tomorrow. Do not just let your visa expire.

There is no mechanism to extend a Standard Visitor visa. You might be able to claim force majeure if you were trapped in the UK and had no alternative but to overstay, but currently you do have viable options to leave. As an aside, hopefully you are already aware that there are restrictions on visitors carrying out volunteering activities, see App3 (4)

"I am trying to travel to Austria from Brussels by train, and have conflicting information on the status of cancellations due to Covid-19.

According to Eurail, ""all rail services from Germany to Austria are cancelled until further notice""
https://www.eurail.com/en/help/travel-disruptions/coronavirus-update

Yet, Deutsche Bahn and the 'trainline.eu' both allow me to book high-speed ICE trains across the border, just not the Nightjet trains. There are notices saying that there are delays/reduced services expected at the border, but it is not impossible to book like it is for other trains.

My questions:


does this mean that it is still possible to take the high-speed ICE trains?
if not, is there any other way that it is permitted to travel over the German border to Austria (e.g. by bus, coach or taxi)? Unfortunately driving is not an option.

","The official website of Deutsche Bahn lists the current interruptions due to corona (only in german, trying to change the language to english took me back to the main page): 

https://www.bahn.de/p/view/service/aktuell/index.shtml

According to this site, several trains between Germany and Austria have been cancelled, including the NightJet, but I assume that other trains are still running. Since the site doesn't mention ICE trains between Germany and Austria, I assume they are still running.

In case the trains stop running before you make it to Austria: If you are eligible to enter Austria, nothing should stop you from entering by taxi (or, taking a taxi to the german side of the border, crossing the border by foot, ordering another taxi to pick you up at the austrian side of the border) - but depending on how close to the border you can get by train this can be quite expensive. 

I wouldn't count on buses or coaches: They have never been quite as popular as trains, and the one company that offered (more or less) regular coach services - Flixbus - stopped operations tonight due to corona.

"Of course this isn't the time to travel, but with prices so low, how can I decide if now the time to buy tickets for future trips?  

I was looking into traveling to Europe or Japan from the United States. While there is a lot of uncertainty right now, it seems like a good time to buy for later travel.  

In my case I was thinking about tickets for late in the year (not before October). I have also heard that COVID-19 could also ""completely cancel"" 2020. I would love to hear some other thoughts on this.
","As an airline employee, working with higher management currently, I can safely tell you it's a gamble.

The aviation business is like a poor handyman in some poor country, whatever money he makes that day is barely enough for food. If the day goes by without work, no meal that day. This is true even for the best of the airlines. Most of the best five-star world-class airlines out there are living off government support! The rich uncle. 

Therefore, unless the airline is supported by the rich uncle, do not buy the ticket. The aviation business will eat dirt in 2020 if the COVID situation stays around for a few months, and it's expected that most of the small/medium airlines will bankrupt or get merged with the bigger ones unless they get some serious government support or take serious measures to cut down cost, the support that most governments are using now to fight the COVID-19. Or, some magic pill comes along in the very near future and COVID-19 becomes past in its infancy.

","Thank you all very much for your comments and suggestions.

Given the uncertainty, I decided to call US Customs and Border protection (didn't even know I could; was only on hold for 3 minutes.) They said that her current plan is just as risky as coming to SFO 15 or 17 days since leaving the Schengen Area. The remaining risk is just due to the discretionary power of the CBP officer, and the CBP person on the phone said that she had heard of travelers getting turned away more than 14 days after exiting the Schengen Area because of this discretion. In her words to me, ""I just hope she gets a good officer.""

The one bit of advice she did give is to print out and provide documentation of travel and the relevant dates, etc., to make the situation clear to the CBP officer approving (or not) entry.

"I am a Canadian citizen currently in the United States.

After calling CBSA at 1-204-983-3500, they indicated that returning to Canada right now would be considered ""non-essential"". Does that mean as a Canadian citizen, I would be denied entry to Canada? Wouldn't this be illegal/unconstitutional to deny a Canadian citizen entry to Canada?
","According to this tweet from Public Safety Canada about the border restrictions on non-essential travel across the US-Canada border starting March 21, under ""Permitted Travel"", it includes:

"Recently I traveled to India. While traveling back to the USA I got cwop on my F-1 visa in Doha. Then they sent me back to India. 

My question is: I have a one year valid OPT (optional practical training). Can I get a new visa for the OPT?
","CWOP stands for cancelled without prejudice.  The phrase without prejudice means that the reason for cancellation is not to have a negative impact on your future applications for visas or for admission to the US.

Therefore, you ought to be able to apply for a new visa.  However, I am not sure what the rules are surrounding OPT (for that, you should ask at Expatriates), so there may be something going on with that that would prevent it.

The odd thing here, however, is that visas are usually cancelled without prejudice in response to some sort of administrative action.  For example, when one applies for a new visa before the old one is expired, the old visa will be cancelled without prejudice.  A visa cancellation while the bearer is en route to the US would normally be a cancellation with prejudice, because the bearer has been found inadmissible for some reason.

On the other hand, if you were prevented from flying to the US because of the travel ban related to COVID-19, I would think that your visa should not have been cancelled at all.

So I wonder whether there is some additional fact that you haven't mentioned that might explain exactly what happened.  If so, that might also have a bearing on the likelihood that a future visa application would succeed.

"I am Canadian. Since I applied for the visa shortly before the situation got serious, I now have a valid work and travel visa for Germany, but I am afraid they will turn me away at the border/airport.. any thoughts on that matter ?

Germany has enacted an entry ban on all non-citizens, with the only exceptions being for certain travellers transiting to get to their home country or travellers seeking entry into Germany for urgent reasons.

"This decision means what? 


  Sufficient justification for the purpose and circumstances of the
  intended stay was not provided. The specific purpose for which the
  visa was applied for is no longer valid or will cease to be valid
  before you arrive in the member state of destination. No other
  (secondary) purpose was stated at the time of the application, of if
  it was, insufficient documentation was provided to demonstrate the
  purpose of the stay. Therefore, your application for a visa is
  refused.

","To understand what it means, let's unpack the text of the decision.


  Sufficient justification for the purpose and circumstances of the intended stay was not provided.


That's one of the standard reasons for refusals provided in the Schengen Visa Code and other official documents. In general, it means that the consulate is not convinced you have a valid purpose for travel. There are many reasons why that might be and the rest is just an explanation of how they reached that conclusion.


  The specific purpose for which the visa was applied for is no longer valid or will cease to be valid before you arrive in the member state of destination.


This one is more specific and should help understand the first one. What this means is that the purpose for the trip you described in your original application might have been valid at some point in the past but it is not current anymore. Imagine you want to attend a conference but your application is delayed and the date of the conference has passed by the time the application is being assessed. Going to a conference is a perfectly valid purpose for a trip but if that specific conference has passed, you cannot possibly attend it and it's not a valid purpose for a visit anymore. 

It's difficult to say more without knowing more about your application but there are currently many restrictions on entry, travel and access to public areas across Europe due to the Covid-19 pandemic. So there are many legitimate trips to the Schengen area that are just not possible anymore. For example, if you applied for a visa to vacation in Italy, providing hotel bookings, etc. your trip does not have a purpose anymore as it won't be possible for you to stay at these hotels or visit any sights.


  No other (secondary) purpose was stated at the time of the application, [or] if it was, insufficient documentation was provided to demonstrate the purpose of the stay. 


A single journey can very well have several purposes. Even if one of them ceases to be valid, it doesn't mean that the trip is necessarily useless. But, in the judgment of the consular officer, you did not describe any other sufficient purpose for this journey. It could be a reference to some detail of your application or simply some boilerplate they add to all such decisions.

[Note: I changed “of“ into “or”. It makes more sense in this sentence; it could be a simple typo or a confusion with the Dutch word “of“, which does mean “or”.]

So what does it mean for you? The decision is negative, you won't get a visa and cannot travel at this time. An appeal does not seem to make sense to me so you will need to start a new application from scratch if you want to travel to the Schengen area in the future.

On the other hand, that's not the worst reason to be refused a visa. Nothing suggests the consular officer suspected that you might be lying (they can use a different phrasing - “the justification […] was not reliable” in that case) and they haven't expressed any doubt regarding your personal situation and willingness to abide by the rules. So a new application in a few months from now, when Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted, seems like it would have good chances to be successful.

"I want to do a multi day cycle tour in Germany, but campsites are closed.

According to the interior ministry (Coronavirus: Fragen und Antworten) 


  Der Aufenthalt im öffentlichen Raum ist nur alleine ... gestattet."" (I can go into public places on my own).


2 questions


Can I do a multi-day cycle tour? Mainly in the Saarland and Rheinland-Pfalz. Perhaps also Hessen. 
Can I camp in public spaces?


The questions are in the context of the Corona virus. In previous years in summer I have seen people camp out in the open along various rivers (Mosel, Rhine, Saale, Fulda). Myself I have camped in the open in the Blackforest, Erzgebirge and various other parts of Germany. But there was no Corona virus. I do not want to know if stealth / wild camping is allowed in normal times. 

I am also worried that with a touring bicycle (bags on rear and front racks), the authorities will immediately see that I am doing a tourist activity and not simply going to work.

(I am already legally in Germany.)
","TL;DR: You can, possibly, in some places, but it may not be a great idea.

Whether it is legal depends on the Bundesland (state) — to put it simply, the federal government has no authority in these matters, and each state put down their own rules. There are federal rules for entry into Germany, but these don't apply as you are already in the country.

Example rules

For example: In Saarland they implemented a lockdown (possibly due to their proximity to the heavy-hit regions of France): You may only leave your home due to ""important reasons"". On the other hand Rheinland-Pfalz has a ""contact prohibition"", which means that you can free to go wherever you want, as long as you are with no more than one other person. 

Also, individual cities have the right to be more restrictive.

Things change

Case numbers will rise in Germany and regulations may become more strict at any moment. In which case it may be difficult for you to go back home (also: Do not count on any restrictions being lifted until well after Easter — at best)

Infrastructure is shut down

However, even in Rheinland-Pfalz accommodations are not open for touristic purposes. This will include campgrounds. ""Wild"" camping is only regulated by the Länder, but generally there will be restrictions, and camping spots may be cordoned off. 

Also, most public services that are useful for travellers are also shut down.

Enforcement

It is difficult to say how things will be enforced. Generally there's no formal requirements in Germany, unlike in Italy or France. They will still stop and fine you if you blatantly flout the rules. My guess is that nobody will go and check for wild camping in the middle of nowhere, but they may check popular camping spots to make sure people don't congregate there.

Responsibility

Cycling alone is not really an (additional) risk, as long as you don't meet people. However, the question is if it is going to be a fun trip if you


can't go in places like the Saarland,
keep to yourself all the time,
have to find a remote spot to pitch your tent each night, and have no access to sanitary facilities,
have to bring/buy and cook your own food (there will be no restaurants).


Plus, Germany is a densely populated country — it will be hard to really be alone. And as soon as more than one person pitches their tent in one place, the police will likely see that as a ""congregation"" and break it up. 

In all honesty, it is probably a better idea to stay put in one place. If the local laws allow it, you can still go cycling and return to your home each night.

"Similar to this question but for the EU. I need to repatriate myself and my car from Prague to London. Ideally I would cross the Czech/German, German/Dutch, Dutch/Belgian, Belgian/French, and French/British borders but the list of countries could be varied by increasing the length of my journey.

I am finding it very hard to tell if I will be denied entry at any of the borders I need to cross. All I can find are vague media reports which use phrases such as ""limited to essential travel"". It's not clear what constitutes essential travel, and specifically whether returning to my home country will be sufficient reason for a country to allow me in. For example, they may reason that I can return home by finding a route that bypasses them, and therefore it is not ""essential"" that I cross their border.

I hold a British passport, Czech residency permit, and have homes in both countries. The UK is my primary residence.

I have a ferry booked from France -> UK and as far as I can tell entries are still permitted there.

Are there any authoritative sources of information where I can find out exactly what the restrictions are within the EU? Alternatively, individual sources for the countries I'm travelling through would be helpful.

If her Extension of Status is approved, she will be retroactively granted status from when her last status expired.

See this brochure:


  What if I file for an extension of stay on time but USCIS doesn’t make
  a decision before my I–94  expires?
  
  Your lawful nonimmigrant status ends, and you are out of status, when
  your Form I-94 expires, even if you have timely applied to extend your
  nonimmigrant status.  Generally, as a matter of discretion, USCIS will
  defer any removal proceedings until after the petition is adjudicated
  and USCIS decides your request for extension of nonimmigrant status.
  [...]
  
  Even though you are not actually in a lawful nonimmigrant status, you
  do not accrue “unlawful presence” for purposes of inadmissibility
  under section 212(a)(9)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,
  while your extension of status application is pending if it was filed
  prior to the expiration of your Form I-94.
  
  [...]
  
  If your application for an extension of stay is approved, the approval
  will relate back to the date your Form I-94 expired, and your status
  while your application is pending will then be considered to have been
  lawful.
  
  If your application is denied, you may be required to cease employment
  and depart the United States immediately.
  
  In addition, any nonimmigrant visa in your passport granted in
  connection with your classification becomes void. Once your visa is
  void, you must submit any new visa application at a U.S. consulate in
  your home country (not a third country, except in rare instances as
  determined by the U.S. Department of State).


If her timely-filed, non-frivolous Extension of Status application is denied, and her I-94 has expired, and she is still in the US on the date of the denial, she will start to accrue ""unlawful presence"" from the date of the denial. 

See AFM chapter 40.9.2(b)(3)(D)(iv):


  If a timely filed, non-frivolous request for EOS or COS is denied for
  cause, unlawful presence begins to accrue the day after the request is
  denied.


And 9 FAM 302.11-3(B)(1)(b)(4)(b)(ii):


  b. DHS has interpreted ""period of stay authorized by the Secretary of
  Homeland Security,"" as used in this context, to include:
  
  (4) For aliens who have applied for extension of stay or change of
  nonimmigrant classification and who have remained in the United States
  after expiration of the From I-94 while awaiting DHS's decision, the
  entire period of the pendency of the application, provided that: 
  
  (a) the alien does not work unlawfully while the application is
  pending and did not work unlawfully prior to filing the application;
  and
  
  (b) the alien did not otherwise fail to maintain his or her status
  prior to the filing of the application (unless the application is
  approved at the discretion of USCIS and the failure to maintain status
  is solely a result of the expiration of the Form I-94), and further
  provided either:
  
  (i) [...]; or
  
  (ii) if the application was denied or the alien departed while the
  application was still pending, that the application was timely filed
  and nonfrivolous.


""Unlawful presence"" doesn't cause a ban unless she leaves the US after accrues more than 180 days of ""unlawful presence"". So she shouldn't have to worry about a ban as long as she leaves within a reasonable amount of time after she learns about the denial.

The other consequence of her being still in the US when her Extension of Status is denied if her I-94 is expired, is that INA 222(g) is triggered, which means the visa she used to enter the US is automatically voided, and she would have to apply for US visas from her country of nationality from then on.

Also, USCIS has a policy where they will issue Notices to Appear (NTAs) to people after an I-539 denial if they are unlawfully present after the denial, although I am not sure whether they are still doing that during the COVID-19 outbreak. According to this teleconference, they will wait for a 33-day period (the period to file a Motion to Reopen or Reconsider) after the denial before they issue the NTA, so this basically means your mother should try to leave within 33 days of a denial.

On the other hand, if she leaves the US while her timely-filed, non-frivolous Extension of Status application is still pending (i.e. before it is approved or denied), she does not accrue any ""unlawful presence"", and her visa is not voided.

See AFM chapter 40.9.2(b)(3)(C):


  Departure from the United States while a request for EOS or COS is
  pending, does not subject an alien to the 3-year, 10-year, or
  permanent bar, if he or she departs after the expiration of Form I-94,
  Arrival/Departure Record unless the application was frivolous,
  untimely, or the individual had worked without authorization.


And the 9 FAM 302.11-3(B)(1)(b)(4)(b)(ii) passage quoted previously.

And it does not void her visa under INA 222(g), according to 9 FAM 302.1-9(B)(1)(c)(4)(B):


  [...] In addition, if an alien departs after the date on the Form I-94
  passes, but before his or her application for extension or change of
  status has been decided by USCIS, they must be subject to a blanket
  exemption from INA 222(g), if the application was filed in a ""timely
  manner"" and is ""nonfrivolous"" in nature.  You may consider an
  application nonfrivolous if it is not, on its face, a groundless
  excuse for the applicant to remain in the United States to engage in
  activities incompatible with his or her status.  Posts may be
  satisfied that an alien filed in a timely manner using evidence such
  as a record in USCIS Person Centric Query Service (PCQS) or the dated
  receipt or canceled check from USCIS for the payment of the
  application fee to extend or change status together with evidence of
  the expiration of the alien's legal status.


The meaning of being timely-filed and non-frivolous are described in AFM chapter 40.9.2(b)(3)(C):


  [...]
  
  The requirement that the application was timely may be established
  through the submission of evidence of the date the previously
  authorized stay expired, together with a copy of a dated filing
  receipt, a canceled check payable to USCIS for the EOS or COS
  application, or other credible evidence of a timely filing.
  
  [...]
  
  To be considered non-frivolous, the application must have an arguable
  basis in law and fact, and must not have been filed for an improper
  purpose (such as to prolong one’s stay to pursue activities
  inconsistent with one’s status).
  
  In determining whether an EOS or COS application was non-frivolous,
  DOS has instructed consular posts that it is not necessary to make a
  determination that USCIS would have ultimately ruled in favor of the
  alien.


And 9 FAM 302.11-3(B)(5)(b-c):


  b. [...] Therefore, for all cases involving potential inadmissibility
  under INA 212(a)(9)(B) whether under the three-year bar of
  212(a)(9)(B)(i)(I) or the 10-year bar of INA 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II), DHS
  has decided to consider all time during which an application for
  extension of stay (EOS) or change of nonimmigrant status (COS) is
  pending to be a period of stay authorized by the Secretary of Homeland
  Security provided:
  
  (1) The application was filed in a timely manner; i.e., before the
  expiration date of the Form I-94, Arrival and Departure Record;
  
  (2) The application was ""nonfrivolous""; and
  
  (3) The alien has not engaged in unauthorized employment (whether
  before or after April 1, 1997).
  
  [...]
  
  c. To be considered ""nonfrivolous"" the consular officer must find that
  the application had an arguable basis in law and fact and must not
  have been filed for an improper purpose (e.g., as a groundless excuse
  for the applicant to remain in activities incompatible with his or her
  status).  It is not necessary to determine that the DHS would have
  approved the application for it to be considered nonfrivolous.


So the question is whether her application of Extension of Status is ""frivolous"" or not. Note that it is possible for an application to be ""non-frivolous"" even if USCIS is likely to deny it; it just needs to have an ""arguable basis in law and fact"" and not be ""filed for an improper purpose"".

In my (non-professional) opinion, an application of Extension of Status for the reason of not being able to return to her home country to due COVID-19 flight bans is not frivolous. In the USCIS page on Special Situations, it mentions that for applications of Extension of Status and Change of Status, USCIS will take into consideration how special situations prevented your departure.

"In 2019 I booked a flight ticket with SAS to Svalbard. Unfortunately Covid19 happened.

My ticket is from a flight outside the nordic countries, with a layover in Oslo.

I'll be prevented from entering Norway, since I'm not a resident. Moreover, even if I was already in Norway right now, I'd be prevented from boarding the flight from Oslo to Longyearbyen, since Svalbard  also separately restricted travel.

To add to the complexity, when I tried to book this ticket, SAS doesn't offer a flight with a single layover. All of the flights I found have a further layover in Stavanger, Stockholm, Copenhagen... even if SAS offers direct flights to Oslo! The solution I found was to book with a travel agent which sold me a ticket with a single layover.

So, SAS has a page for Covid19 information, with links to a search tool (a bit buggy and annoying to use) to check cancelled and confirmed flights, I haven't been able to confirm it for sure, but the closer we are to the departure date (it's less than 10 days from now), it seems that the less likely it'll be for it to be cancelled.

I have the option of REBOOKING FREE OF CHARGE, unfortunately The rebooking can be made only once. and due to the current uncertainty, it's really difficult to pick another sensible date on which to plan my trip (no idea when Norway and Svalbard will reopen to visitors).

In theory, I have the option to exchange my flight ticket for a voucher, that way I'd have the option to defer choosing the new date, which would suit me much better. Unfortunately The voucher is valid for bookings made directly with SAS (not for bookings made by travel agents).

I already contacted my travel agent 6 days ago. They ask not to call, and contact them via their ticketing system only for trips in the next 4 weeks. Unfortunately, both messages I sent them have been replied with an automated reply which suggests to call them on the phone (phone which only has a recorded message, saying that they are unable to take calls due to the huge volume of requests).

So, it seems that I'm stuck. I was thinking that given that in normal circumstances I have right to travel to norway (being an EEA citizen), if I'm denied boarding I should be able to at least hope for compensation according to EU regulation 261.  Though it seems there's an exception  For safety, security or health reasons, which usually is for different kinds of concerns, but it might be applied to a blanket ban on non-residents due to Covid19.
Regardless if that exception happens, I'd have to actually attempt boarding (be at the airport on time) to actually claim compensation. I could do that, but that seems less than ideal:


I'm social distancing, and I'd rather avoid a needless trip to the airport
As described above, I don't know if I should realistically expect compensation (maybe you can help me here)
I'd have to hope that the airline would really not let me board (given that I'd then be stuck in Norway without a flight to come back immediately), though I guess I can go past the gate and then turn back before entering the plane.


I guess that if the worst thing that happens to me during this pandemic is that I'll lose out on the money for this flight ticket, that's still pretty good, all things considered. Before giving up on it though, maybe you have some suggestion on how to able to be refunded?
","If someone has an answer to the general question, that's still welcome, but to provide an update on my specific situation:

It seems that things will resolve for the best: the airline ended up cancelling the flight, and the travel agent wrote me that they'll go ahead with the refund process.

I've actually only received automated emails from the agent, and I've been unable to speak with anyone. Otoh I've actually been able to speak with someone from the airline, so this experience is persuading me to try even harder in the future to avoid booking via a travel agent.

"My flight is from Detroit to Haneda Airport to Manila. Do I need to get a transit visa for Japan, because my layover at Haneda is 19 hours? I am a citizen of the Philippines.
","Yes, you can transit without a visa at Haneda airport, if your connection time between flights is less than 72 hours.

If you have not been to any of the areas affected by Covid-19 then you may also be able to get a Shore Pass so that you can enter Japan and stay landside during your layover.

Timatic, the database which airlines use to verify passenger travel documents, states in part:


  Visa required, except for Passengers transiting through Tokyo
  (HND) or Osaka (KIX) with a confirmed onward ticket for a
  flight to a third country within 72 hours. They must stay in
  the international transit area of the airport and have
  documents required for the next destination. 
  
  Visa required, except for Passengers with a passport and a
  confirmed onward ticket to a third country within 72 hours can
  obtain a Shore Pass on arrival if there are no connecting
  flights on the same calendar day. They must:
  
  
  have documents required for the next destination; and
  have proof of sufficient funds to cover their stay; and 
  arrive at and depart from an airport or seaport located
  within the same group below.
  Group A:
  Airports: Narita (NRT), Haneda (HND), Nagoya (NGO), Niigata
  (KIJ), Komatsu (KMQ) and Yokota (OKO).
  Seaports: Tokyo, Yokohama, Niigata and Nagoya.
  


(Covid-19 entry restrictions omitted as these change frequently. At this time I don't recommend trying to get a Shore Pass as people entering Japan from the USA are being asked to self-quarantine for 14 days.)

"My friend had a 15-days visa from France. His flight to Iran got canceled because of the coronavirus. After that, he came to Germany (Munich) because he had relatives here and went to the immigration office (KVR) to extend his visa. They told him that he can extend his visa but he should provide insurance. After providing insurance the immigration office got closed. He has sent several emails but he hasn't got any response yet. His visa is expired now and we are so worried about this issue. Is it possible for him to go back to Iran with an expired visa in this situation? The border police say that it's not possible and going back is an emergency now for him.

Do you have any suggestions for this situation?
","The visa status should not prevent him from leaving Germany. Under normal circumstances overstays may be punished, but for people who leave on their own after a few days that would at most be a fine. That makes the response by the border police puzzling. Are you sure nothing was lost in translation?

The city of Munich writes:


Contact the KVR before the visa expires. He has done that.
He will receive a certification which is valid until the KVR reopens. That hasn't happened yet.
If there is no reply yet, he should send a mail with scans of 


Passport and visa
A confirmation of the hotel or host where he is staying.
A proof that departure is impossible. (They don't say what that is.)
If available, proof of health insurance.



So it seems that he did everything required and the city administration can't keep up. 

He should take care to get everything documented properly so that there are no problems with the next Schengen visa application. 



While I understand that returning home might be a personal emergency for him, I would think that Munich is reasonably safe at this time. Germany has more confirmed infections than Iran, but fatalities are fewer.

"We booked a holiday cottage in the UK for the end of July 2020. We neglected to purchase travel insurance when we booked it at the start of 2020 (we've learnt from this mistake). We have already started paying the balance on this trip.

So now we are looking at purchasing travel insurance but we are concerned that the Covid-19 lockdown currently in the UK, will invalidate any insurance we take out now. The optimistic estimates put the end of the lockdown around the 15th June.

Is it worth us taking out the insurance now to protect our existing deposit/holiday or is likely that all insurance policies purchased now will be invalidated if there is an extension to the lockdown?

Any guidance on this is much appreciated.
","Generally speaking it is worth considering cover now for a future trip, but it's unlikely that a standard travel insurance policy regulated by the UK will cover you for Covid-19 related problems. So far as I'm aware, none will.

Several UK insurers aren't even selling travel insurance policies for the time being.

Compare the Market says in its online quote page:


  Following the World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring coronavirus as
  a pandemic on the 11th March 2020, many insurance companies will
  consider coronavirus to be a 'known event'. Insurance providers may
  exclude known events from elements of the cover they offer.
  
  Therefore for new policies purchased after the announcement ensure you
  check the policy wording or contact the insurer to ensure the cover
  meets your needs.


I think that's standard now.

You may find it difficult to speak with an insurer by phone as they are swamped with claims and requests for policy amendments and refunds.

If you do find such a policy as you want, make sure you thoroughly read all the documentation.

"I made a non-refundable hotel room booking through the hotel website. The hotel is located in the Netherlands.

Two days ago, a hotel manager informed me that they close the hotel for a certain period that included the period of my stay due to the Coronavirus, and that is why they were forced to move my reservation to another date. However, I do not want to move my reservation and would like to get the money back because I did not cancel my reservation, so I informed the hotel about it. The hotel, however, states that they are forced to move my reservation to another date as I made a non-refundable booking.

I checked the official website of the government of the Netherlands as was advised here and the rules of the hotel on their website but have not found anything on this matter. The rules, however, are on Dutch, so I could misunderstand or skip something (I do not speak Dutch at all).
As far as I understand the situation based on John's question and answers, I am entitled to a refund. Are there some documents that I can cite to the hotel to get a refund?

P.S. My sister booked the same hotel for the same dates (non-refundable hotel room booking as well) but through Booking. She was able to get a refund after several e-mails. However, she made the booking from Russia (the Netherlands deny the entry for foreigners having a tourist visa), while I did it from Germany where I have permanent residency.
","Did you contact them?

They try to move the bookings, so that they have the money (liquidity) to pay employers. They could be in trouble if all clients will ask refund (there could ask government for help).

But you booking is a contract, so they are required to fulfill the contract on the data you both agreed, or they must refund you.  Just they try (maybe with a better offer) to keep booking (and money) for a later period.

The website booking.com doesn't get money from you (you will pay the hotel), so they have no really interest to have the ""move booking"" default.

So try to contact them, and think: do you want to book in a later date? In that case you may try to get a very good offer. But they must refund you.

The last step, it is to contact your credit card, and get the money back from them, because you were charged a service they will not offer you.

"As many flights are cancelled due to COVID-19, it can be sometimes difficult to find a flight between a given country becomes available. How can I get notified when a flight between from a given airport to a given country becomes available within the next n days (where n can be defined by the user, e.g. n=7)? Or otherwise when the soonest available flight changes its date?



I have crossposted the question at:


Quora

","Assuming you want to fly home (and you should only be trying to fly home), your best bet is the consular staff of your country. For example, various Canadian government agencies are tweeting about flights to Canada from specific airports. Here's a snapshot of the feed of travel.gc.ca:



In addition to following your country (and subsets of it like the ""Canada in Lebanon"" and ""Canada in Singapore"" accounts you see in the screenshot) you should have registered with your government so they can email, call or text you, and you should probably have called your embassy or consulate for advice about how to get home. 

If you aren't trying to get home, but are trying to reach a relative or someone else who really needs you, these same sources are the ones that are likely to help you. If you think your travel need isn't urgent enough to get an embassy involved, then stop trying to travel. People are desperately trying to get home, to reunite families, to get out while they can. If you've just always wanted to see a particular place, now is not the time.

Bottom line: make sure at least one qualified human who is connected to your target country knows you're trying to get there, then start monitoring the heck out of airlines, airports, and those embassies and consulates on all the social media you can think of, and getting yourself on group chats and multi emails and facebook groups, so you'll be notified when there's a chance to go. And be ready to go when the chance comes.

"Someone I know booked a return flight on Air Serbia from Vienna to Podgorica (Montenegro) via Belgrade, departing on 6 March 2020 and returning on 14 March 2020.  On 10 March 2020, Air Serbia cancelled the return leg from Belgrade to Vienna without explanation; the passenger contacted Air Serbia by phone, who rebooked them on the next available flight, 24 hours later than the original return date.  Air Serbia told them on the phone that reasonable transport, meal, and accommodation costs for the unplanned overnight stay in Belgrade would be compensated.

According to Air Serbia's statement of passenger rights*, the EU Regulation 261/2004 on flight compensation is integrated into Serbian law, so we assume that the passenger is entitled not only to the costs for the stay in Belgrade, but also €250 in compensation for the cancelled flight.

The passenger accordingly made a claim for compensation (both the overnight expenses and the €250 cancellation award) using Air Serbia's online form*, including all the relevant travel information and documentation (receipts, etc.).  Air Serbia just now rejected the claim as follows:


  Thank you for your patience while the claim relating to your journey from BEG to PRG on 14.3.2020 was processed.
  
  After carefully reviewing your claim, I regret to inform you that we are not able to provide compensation in this case. This decision was reached taking into account the specific circumstances of your case, due to the coronavirus pandemic. Please note that the decision is final.
  
  We’re sorry that our service on 14.3.2020 did not meet your expectations and hope that we can look forward to welcoming you on-board an Air Serbia flight in the future.


We are skeptical about this rejection for the following reasons:


On the phone, Air Serbia had already promised compensation at least for the transport, accommodation, and meals in Belgrade.
Air Serbia cancelled the flight before the governments of Serbia and Austria had imposed any restrictions on foreign travel relating to the coronavirus pandemic.
At no time before now had Air Serbia indicated that the cancellation was due to the pandemic.
According to the answer to another Covid-19–related question here (May I get a refund for a flight cancelled because of COVID-19?), ""under EU rules you always get a refund"".


We would therefore like answers to the following:


Under Serbian or EU law (whichever is applicable in our case), is the passenger in fact entitled to compensation in this case?
If the answer to the previous question is ""yes"", then to what enforcement body can the passenger appeal Air Serbia's final decision?  The EU helpfully provides a list of national enforcement bodies for EC 261/2004, but Serbia is not on this list.  If there's no national enforcement body in Serbia, can the passenger appeal to the one in Austria, given that she bought the ticket and is resident there?




* Note that due to Air Serbia's broken website, you may need to follow that link twice before the correct page appears.  It seems that first-time visitors to the website are always redirected to its home page.
","The €250 compensation doesn't apply in extraordinary circumstances beyond the airline's control. While it's not certain that this applies, it's highly likely now during Covid-19.

However, extra expenses (accommodation, food) are to be reimbursed, per Article 9 of the EC261 regulation.

So contact them again and mention this (of course, attach the receipts). Tell them that Article 9 of EC261 applies regardless of any extraordinary circumstances.

And if you want to be dead certain if extraordinary cirumstances apply or not (i.e. whether or not the €250 compensation is due), ask a firm such as Claimcompass to investigate it. It costs nothing, and they have sophisticated resources for checking things, but if they find compensation is due, they'll keep 35% of the amount for themselves.

"I was on vacation in the US for 3 weeks. I am a Colombian citizen. 

Before I was to return on March 23 to Colombia my flight was cancelled due to Colombia closing its borders including to its citizens that were traveling overseas at the time. All international flights have been canceled.  

What happens if my visa travel date expires before I can leave to go to Colombia?
","You have 3 options.


Your US entry could be still valid for a few months. Usually, an entry is valid for 6 months. You can plan to stay in US till situation is clear and flights are open to Colombia. It can be a few months.
If your entry is expiring, you can apply for an extension.
You can contact your embassy about the possibility of repatriation or any other help. Even if normal flights are not allowed, repatriation with quarantine might be possible.

"I requested a B-2 visa extension on September for my mother, she has to stay until may 14, so she is already 1 year in USA as a visitor, but due to covid-19 I am worry about her health, she is 74 years old, with dementia and diabetes my father is the one who takes care for her, He is citizen. Is possible to get a new extension while everything is safe here or in our country?
","To answer your question, yes, there is no limit to the number of times status can be extended during one stay (note that it is the status that is extended; visas cannot be extended, since visas are only for entry anyway), and it is possible to apply for another B2 extension of status before the current extended status expires. Of course, the chances of approval of an extension of status goes down with each additional extension. The fact that she has a US citizen spouse in the US also may make it likely that she will be denied for immigrant intent. But at least an application for extension of status (filed before her status expires) will allow her to stay while the application is pending, which can be several months, so it will buy her more time.

As some comments have noted, if she intends to keep staying in the US, it would be better for her to not apply for extension of status, and instead apply for Adjustment of Status to get a green card in the US through a petition from her spouse.

"On 16th March, 2020 the EU announced a 30 day travel restriction for all non-essential travel. On 6th April, 2020 Germany has announced the new updated travel restrictions to Germany. However, there is not much clarity for information about students. 

Can anybody provide information on what are the restrictions (if any) for people people who need to travel to Germany for their studies (starting summer 2020) on national visa (Type-D)? How will these restrictions affect people, who are about to come to Germany on student visa(s)?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
","At present there are to many unknowns to give a reliable answer.

Assuming that the present restrictions remain until September:


a D-Visa will be required 


which is what a Student Visa is

the Universities will be opened up in some form allowing new students to start


taking up residence would probably be considered a valid reason. 

A quarantine period of 14 days, being introduced on the 10th of April, must be fulfilled.

"I bought a Ryanair return ticket from Zadar (Croatia) to Wroclaw (Poland) in February 2020, and my flight was scheduled for the middle of May. On March 21 I received an official mail that I was able to cancel my reservation and claim a full refund of the unused flight(s), and I did that. In the same mail they wrote: Refunds will be processed within 7 working days back to the form of payment used for the original booking.
That period already passed, but on March 28 I received a second mail, and this is in short the body of the message:


  Due to the high volume of flight cancellations due to COVID 19, we are experiencing an unprecedented high volume of requests. We are currently working through the backlog and ask that you please bear with us... Please do not resubmit your request.


All this time I am very patient, but today I got a third mail from Ryanair:


  Dear Customer,
  The spread of the Covid-19 Virus and associated Government travel restrictions, continues to have a negative impact on the schedules of all Ryanair Group Airlines.
  As a result of this we want to offer our customers as much flexibility as possible in relation to their scheduled travel plans. We are now offering you the following options in relation to your booked flight.
  
  
  You can change your flight to any date in the next 3 months, up to Aug 31 2020.
  The flight change fee will be waived in full.
  You will only have to pay the difference in fare.
  This flight date change will only apply to the route you have already booked.
  Please do not try to change to another date in May.
  
  
  We apologise for any inconvenience caused by this unprecedented crisis. The safety and well-being of our people and customers is our main priority, and we are working closely with the state authorities and we will follow any travel restrictions that are imposed and will continue to comply with all WHO and EASA guidelines to combat the Covid-19 virus.

What should I do? I was travelling to Wroclaw for Erasmus+ staff week, which is postponed. 

EDIT:

Few moments ago I received another official mail, it is very logical, and I will keep with patience...


  Dear Customer,
  
  I refer to our recent correspondence regarding your refund request on
  booking XYZZYX
  
  As previously advised, our Customer Services Team are experiencing an
  unprecedented high volume of requests due to the COVID-19 crisis and
  we are prioritising our most vulnerable customers. This has been
  compounded by government public health restrictions on non-essential
  work travel which means we have less staff available to us during this
  busy time. Please rest assured your refund request is currently in the
  queue and will be processed. If you have selected new travel dates and
  would prefer to move your booking, please contact us
  
  We appreciate your patience at this time.
  
  Yours sincerely, Ryanair Customer Services

","With RyanAir, I would continue to insist on the refund.  If it was done on a Visa debit or credit card, I’d ask the bank to reverse it.  I suspect that will be faster than waiting for RyanAir.  But give the bank the evidence that you’re supposed to get a refund.  Otherwise, they’ll say it was a legitimate charge.

"I read on https://twitter.com/RichardBarrow/status/1247761807839657984?s=20:


  In addition, for repatriation flights, you often have to check in extra early like 3-4 hours beforehand. 


Why does one often have to check in  extra early, i.e. 3-4 hours early, before the flight departure for repatriation flights?



I have crossposted the question at:


Quora

","The additional check in time is needed for all the extra paperwork.  Repatriation flights are organized and approved by governments to help return citizens to their country of origin.  They can't let anyone on board who is simply willing to pay the fare.  They must check and double check your passport, citizenship status, etc.  Moreover, scheduling a repatriation flight is not the same as regular commercial flight operation.  The planes often arrive empty, without a regular gate to occupy, without a regular slot to fly and the whole operation can be changed at the last-minute.  If you really want to get on the flight then it's best to be there extra early to deal with the unexpected.

"I had a ski trip planned from 14th March - 21st March. 
I arrived in the French ski resort at 15:00 on 14th March and by 23:00 the French government went into lock down and ordered all non-essential businesses to close immediately - including ski resorts. 

Fearing being stuck in the resort, the next morning I changed my return flight from 21st March to 16th March and had to pay extra fees.

I tried to contact my insurance company but they did not answer. I was also in a rush as my accommodation has ordered me to leave, but I do not have proof of this in writing unfortunately.

I am now trying to claim these extra fees back from my insurance company but they are stating that because the FCO (UK Govt) did not announce non essential travel until the 17th March I have no claim. 

The exact wording in my travel policy for curtailment is:


  If you have to curtail your trip as a result of the Travel Advice Unit of the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office
  (FCO), the World Health Organisation (WHO) or similar body recommending evacuation from the country or
  specific area in which you are travelling, providing the directive came into force after you purchased this
  insurance and after you have left your Country of Residence to commence the trip (whichever is the later).


And the reply from my insurance company was:


  Unfortunately, from the information you provided, it would appear as shown above, the reason you abandoned your trip is not included in the specified incidents for which cover is provided under the policy. 
  You paid the fee to amend your flight on the 15th of March, however, the FCO advice to travel to/from France came into force on the 17th of March. We are therefore unable to consider your claim further.


This is really cheeky of them and they clearly don't want to pay out. I need some advice on the fact that I was already abroad at the time of this announcement - the host country has ordered everything to close and therefore my trip will be cut short. 

What points can I argue that my policy is in fact valid and I am due a refund?
Thanks
","The wording states 


...or similar body recommending evacuation from the country



So although the FCO might not have issued advice until later, the fact that the French government ordered all resorts closed should be sufficient.

So you need to find this advice from French government sources online, write back to your insurance company and be polite but firm and point this out to them.  Keep your letter short and to the point and state that you had no choice and the country was being locked down and all non-residents ordered to leave.
Therefore, according to the T&amp;Cs of your policy you expect the claim to be honoured and paid in full ASAP.

Also point them to this statement from the Financial Conduct Authority:
https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/insurance-and-coronavirus-our-expectations

And this:
https://www.choose.co.uk/news/2020/covid-19-insurance-policy-advice-government/

State that you are disappointed with their behaviour and are considering complaining to the insurance ombudsman.  And will pursue the claim further if they do not pay.

If they still refuse, then your only option is to complain to the ombudsman and/or pursue them in the small claims court.

"I have booked a ticket for future travel but now see the price has come down considerably. Should I cancel because of coronavirus and rebook with voucher?
","You can't just 'cancel because of coronavirus'. If the airline is still listing the flight then you can only cancel on whatever terms you agreed to when you booked.

If your ticket is fully refundable then you can cancel and rebook, if you can actually get the refund. Many airlines are refusing to pay refunds at present. 

More likely, there will be some penalty for cancelling, which could be part or all of the fare you've paid. Even with the price reduction, it's likely that you'll end up paying more overall.

If you're hoping to get a full refund (as cash or voucher) then you'll have to wait until the airline cancels the flight, in which case there will be no flight to rebook onto.

"Is it possible to extend the 14-day visa free entry in Vietnam?

I have a Swedish passport, so I can enter Vietnam for 14 days without a visa.

Is it possible to extend that for another 14 days or less somewhere near Saigon? Or at all?
","I found that your concern has not been answer at all. So, I don't know whether you have been to Vietnam with your 15 days visa exemption or not. But as I know, via this link https://www.vietnam-visa.com/vietnam-visa-extension/, a visa exemption can be extended for up to 3 months. Although now, due to COVID 19, Vietnam is temporarily closed to all incoming foreigners, I hope this piece of information will help in case you wish to visit Vietnam in the future with visa exemption.
